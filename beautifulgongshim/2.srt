18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,020
<font color="yellow">Do you happen to be...</font>

19

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,430
<font color="yellow">No, it was just a slip of tongue.</font>

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,730
<font color="yellow">So a perverter...</font>

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,850

<font color="yellow">Oh, I got it.</font>

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,480
<font color="yellow">He must be a pervert with a license.</font>

28

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,920
<font color="yellow">and pass an exam to become a pervert.</font>

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,350
<font color="yellow">Then you'd say, "I'm a perverter."</font>

32

<font color="yellow">Right. I thought so, too.</font>

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,950
<font color="yellow">Did you need a lawyer?</font>

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,020

-  Why?</font>

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,020

44

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,120
<font color="yellow">I'm used to it anyway.</font>

159
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,250
<font color="yellow">The bus card is here.</font>

160
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
<font color="yellow">Where is my bell?</font>

161
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,910
<font color="yellow">I told you to turn around!</font>

162
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,980
<font color="yellow">You're the one at fault here. Why are you yelling at me?</font>

163
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

164
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,050
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

165
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,680
<font color="yellow">I just caught you breaking and entering.</font>

166
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,240
<font color="yellow">I didn't go inside yet.</font>

167
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,620
<font color="yellow">Then it's attempted breaking and entering.</font>

168
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,480
<font color="yellow">I was wondering where you ran off to, and you were here.</font>

169
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,940
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to break and enter empty houses?</font>

170
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,580
<font color="yellow">I came to look for my belongings.</font>

171
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,210
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you change your password?</font>

172
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,650
<font color="yellow">It's my password to change or not.</font>

173
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,290
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem. Why are you looking for your stuff at my place?</font>

174
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,180
<font color="yellow">I dropped it here yesterday.</font>

175
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

176
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,320
<font color="yellow">You sneaked in at night and came under the sheets.</font>

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,170
<font color="yellow">During the day, you showed up in front of my office,</font>

178
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,750
<font color="yellow">then you tried to break and enter. How many crimes will you commit?</font>

179
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,980
<font color="yellow">Come on. You left midway during the legal advice and didn't call.</font>

180
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,650
<font color="yellow">I won't sue. I won't do anything.</font>

181
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

182
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,350
<font color="yellow">Did you get a settlement?</font>

183
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,150
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

184
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,850
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

185
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,720
<font color="yellow">That would mean that I forgave her.</font>

186
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,310
<font color="yellow">I will never forgive that woman.</font>

187
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,440
<font color="yellow">The you should sue her and press charges.</font>

188
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,020
<font color="yellow">You don't make any sense.</font>

189
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know. But I'm still not going to sue.</font>

190
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,570
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

191
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,540
<font color="yellow">I've seen people change their minds a million times.</font>

192
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,940
<font color="yellow">So just send me the video in your phone.</font>

193
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,040
<font color="yellow">I'll attach it as evidence.</font>

194
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,810
<font color="yellow">- I already deleted it.
-  What?</font>

195
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,820
<font color="yellow">I'm really not going to sue. Let's not talk about it again.</font>

196
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,820
<font color="yellow">- Goodness.
-  I'm sorry for barging in.</font>

197
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,150
<font color="yellow">I was going to take my stuff and leave quietly.</font>

198
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,080
<font color="yellow">Will you grab my stuff for me?</font>

199
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,420
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

200
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,650
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll look for it.</font>

201
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,590
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

202
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,850
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

203
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,950
<font color="yellow">You have a female staff with hair...</font>

204
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,150
<font color="yellow">that looks like this, right?</font>

205
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,580
<font color="yellow">- Gong Shim?
-  Yes, her.</font>

206
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,590
<font color="yellow">What about her?</font>

207
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,880
<font color="yellow">As you know, she recently had someone assault her.</font>

208
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,450
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious why she would suddenly drop the charges.</font>

209
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,790
<font color="yellow">Who are you and why are you asking?</font>

210
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,200
<font color="yellow">I'm a close friend of Shim's.</font>

211
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,350
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

212
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,280
<font color="yellow">Right. You'll believe me if I show you a picture, right?</font>

213
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,820
<font color="yellow">Her big sister came in and told me that they found an agreement.</font>

214
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,650
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

215
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,280
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

216
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,180
<font color="yellow">That would mean that I forgave her.</font>

217
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,080
<font color="yellow">I will never forgive that woman.</font>

218
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,950
<font color="yellow">Could I take a look at the security footage?</font>

219
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
<font color="yellow">Since it was settled, I deleted it when Shim's sister was here.</font>

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

221
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,050
<font color="yellow">Have a good night.</font>

222
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

223
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,020
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
-  Hello.</font>

224
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

225
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,650
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of security cameras. How fascinating.</font>

226
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,680
<font color="yellow">Is the new lunchbox in?</font>

227
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,750
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

228
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,620
<font color="yellow">Why did you drop the charges? I was upset just watching it.</font>

229
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,720
<font color="yellow">It just turned out that way.</font>

230
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,820
<font color="yellow">Some guy came earlier...</font>

231
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,050
<font color="yellow">and asked me why you dropped it.</font>

232
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,630
<font color="yellow">Some guy?</font>

233
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,850
<font color="yellow">He told me he's a close friend.</font>

234
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,250
<font color="yellow">Was he wearing capri pants with flip-flops?</font>

235
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,450
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

236
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,920
<font color="yellow">He went into that convenience store.</font>

237
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,750
<font color="yellow">Why is he running around poking at everything?</font>

238
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,780
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

239
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,840
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious about where your cameras are.</font>

240
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,920
<font color="yellow">Where are they located?</font>

241
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,620
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for a camera that looks towards the gas station?</font>

242
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,050
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

243
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,580
<font color="yellow">Some woman came by today and asked me.</font>

244
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,320
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

245
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,950
<font color="yellow">we don't have any cameras that look that way.</font>

246
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,020
<font color="yellow">Why is she angry again?</font>

247
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,760
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

248
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,060
<font color="yellow">I hear you're asking people why I dropped the charges.</font>

249
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,230
<font color="yellow">I only asked since I was passing by.</font>

250
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,960
<font color="yellow">I already told you that I'm not going to sue.</font>

251
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,070
<font color="yellow">You did.</font>

252
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,150
<font color="yellow">Then why are you asking around? What do you want me to do?</font>

253
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,280
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by, that's all. Am I really at wrong here?</font>

254
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,620
<font color="yellow">Let me repeat myself.</font>

255
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,800
<font color="yellow">This is already done with,</font>

256
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,320
<font color="yellow">so don't get into my business.</font>

257
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,090
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

258
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,950
<font color="yellow">Also, please don't mention this incident again. Okay?</font>

259
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

260
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,720
<font color="yellow">"Please don't mention this incident again."</font>

261
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,150
<font color="yellow">"Okay?"</font>

262
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
<font color="yellow">- Lawyer Gong.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

263
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,820
<font color="yellow">Have you heard of the television show "Big Match"?</font>

264
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,520
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've heard of it.</font>

265
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,650
<font color="yellow">Of course, everyone knows "Big Match".</font>

266
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,920
<font color="yellow">Why don't you appear on the show as the programme's panel?</font>

267
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,980
<font color="yellow">You should start showing yourself on media now.</font>

268
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,180
<font color="yellow">Isn't Lawyer Choi on the show already?</font>

269
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,720
<font color="yellow">A new face might do well for our law firm.</font>

270
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,160
<font color="yellow">I already informed the producer.</font>

271
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,350
<font color="yellow">You'll appear in it starting with the next episode.</font>

272
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,450
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's raise our glasses...</font>

273
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,780
<font color="yellow">for the new star, Gong Mi.</font>

274
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
-  Cheers!</font>

275
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,600
<font color="yellow">I'm so mad.</font>

276
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,700
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking and go home.</font>

277
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,550
<font color="yellow">We already had three rounds. You had makgeolli, soju and beer.</font>

278
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,920
<font color="yellow">My dear elementary friend and best friend, Goo Nam.</font>

279
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,480
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask. Will you do it for me?</font>

280
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,150
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

281
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,050
<font color="yellow">Stop yapping and just sit there...</font>

282
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,220
<font color="yellow">like an invisible person, will you?</font>

283
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,150
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't you feel like someone's staring at us?</font>

284
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,880
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

285
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,550
<font color="yellow">Don't look at him.</font>

286
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,120
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

287
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,780
<font color="yellow">It's the perverted lawyer you introduced to me!</font>

288
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,950
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

289
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,750
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like drinking any more.</font>

290
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,280
<font color="yellow">I'm going home.</font>

291
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,800
<font color="yellow">Good idea. Just forget about it and go to bed.</font>

292
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,550
<font color="yellow">You always feel better after you sleep.</font>

293
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,320
<font color="yellow">I hate that even more.</font>

294
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,950
<font color="yellow">I'm going.</font>

295
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,850
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
-  Bye.</font>

296
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,850
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

297
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,830
<font color="yellow">I'm Soo Cheol's friend.</font>

298
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,650
<font color="yellow">- Bang Soo Cheol.
-  Bang...</font>

299
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,930
<font color="yellow">Oh, him.</font>

300
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,260
<font color="yellow">The one that was framed for a motorcycle hit-and-run?</font>

301
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,530
<font color="yellow">Yes. I recommended you...</font>

302
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,920
<font color="yellow">to Shim after hearing the story from Soo Cheol.</font>

303
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,680
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

304
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,530
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you something?</font>

305
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, go ahead.</font>

306
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,520
<font color="yellow">Do you know why...</font>

307
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,320
<font color="yellow">she suddenly gave up pressing charges?</font>

308
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,850
<font color="yellow">What happened is...</font>

309
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,090
<font color="yellow">Shim really wanted to sue her.</font>

310
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,400
<font color="yellow">But the woman who hit her...</font>

311
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,090
<font color="yellow">is the president's wife of the law firm her big sister works at.</font>

312
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,090
<font color="yellow">It's obvious.</font>

313
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,750
<font color="yellow">She decided to give up because of her sister.</font>

314
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,630
<font color="yellow">- Have this.
-  That's okay.</font>

315
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,720
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

316
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,590
<font color="yellow">It's one plus one.</font>

317
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,150
<font color="yellow">This one is free.</font>

318
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,080
<font color="yellow">If she's going to keep this up, she should at least lower my rent.</font>

319
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,620
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

320
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,820
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shim.</font>

321
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,850
<font color="yellow">Hello? Get up.</font>

322
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,180
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shim. Get up.</font>

323
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,820
<font color="yellow">This girl...</font>

324
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
<font color="yellow">Shim...</font>

325
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,120
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

326
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,250
<font color="yellow">Was she going to brush her teeth with this?</font>

327
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,220
<font color="yellow">She ate the soap.</font>

328
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,080
<font color="yellow">I can't hold it in any more!</font>

329
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,220
<font color="yellow">She's a crazy woman!</font>

330
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,760
<font color="yellow">I didn't change my password because I was lazy, but this is annoying.</font>

331
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,220
<font color="yellow">I better change it.</font>

332
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,720
<font color="yellow">They told me it could be up to 20 digits.</font>

333
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,900
<font color="yellow">7, 8, 0, 3, 1, 2,</font>

334
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,920
<font color="yellow">9, 8, 7, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</font>

335
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,480
<font color="yellow">There.</font>

336
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,680
<font color="yellow">She'll never find this one out.</font>

337
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,120
<font color="yellow">What... What was it again?</font>

338
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,020
<font color="yellow">Why would you crawl back in here after what happened last time?</font>

339
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,550
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Are you?</font>

340
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,620
<font color="yellow">But why isn't he changing the password?</font>

341
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,220
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

342
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

343
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,520
<font color="yellow">She must have woken up.</font>

344
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,880
<font color="yellow">It's so cold.</font>

345
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

346
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,630
<font color="yellow">7, 3, 8, 0, 3,</font>

<font color="yellow">Who is that kid?</font>

357
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
<font color="yellow">Why does he keep appearing in my dreams?</font>

358
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,030
<font color="yellow">Forget seaweed soup for his birthday.</font>

359
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,550
<font color="yellow">But he has to skip breakfast?</font>

360
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,280
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for you.</font>

361
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,820
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. Calm down.</font>

362

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,780
<font color="yellow">Even eating making me feel guilty.</font>

365
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,520
<font color="yellow">Are you going to the temple in Cheonan?</font>

366
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,120
<font color="yellow">It's April 22.</font>

367
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,470
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law died...</font>

368
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,880
<font color="yellow">and Joon Pyo disappeared this day.</font>

369
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,650
<font color="yellow">I always visited the temple on this day of the year.</font>

370
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,150
<font color="yellow">I must go down and pray...</font>

371
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,250
<font color="yellow">for Joon Pyo to come back.</font>

372
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,450
<font color="yellow">All right. I hope you have a safe trip.</font>

373
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,550
<font color="yellow">I've heard that you've been preparing and having...</font>

374
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,950
<font color="yellow">an event to celebrate Joon Soo's birthday since several years ago.</font>

375
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,890
<font color="yellow">It's not a celebration event. I'm holding a charity bazaar.</font>

376
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,150
<font color="yellow">I'm holding a charity bazaar to help poor people.</font>

377
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,050
<font color="yellow">You might be late if you don't leave now. Let's hurry.</font>

378
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,420
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, I know you must feel disappointed.</font>

379
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,380
<font color="yellow">But mourn for your missing brother and hold your laughter for today.</font>

380
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

381
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,450
<font color="yellow">It's not Joon Soo's fault. When will she stop talking about Joon Pyo?</font>

382
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,480
<font color="yellow">You won't be standing in this house if Joon Pyo hadn't gone missing!</font>

383
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,020
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk like that?</font>

384
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,740
<font color="yellow">Can you stop mentioning Joon Pyo and make us feel bad?</font>

385
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,600
<font color="yellow">You don't even know whether he's alive or dead yet.</font>

386
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,740
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

387
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,120
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of the name, Joon Pyo. I'd like to see if he's alive.</font>

388
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,970
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can recognise him even if you see him now?</font>

389
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,640
<font color="yellow">It's been 30 years already. Consider him gone.</font>

390
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,050
<font color="yellow">He can't be dead!</font>

391
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,760
<font color="yellow">Stop talking thoughtlessly! You wretch.</font>

392
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,280
<font color="yellow">- Stop, please. Let's go up.
-  Whatever.</font>

393
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,640
<font color="yellow">- Let's leave.
-  Goodness!</font>

394
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,650
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

395
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

396
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,620
<font color="yellow">Everyone in this house makes me feel uncomfortable.</font>

397
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,480
<font color="yellow">You should relax your mind.</font>

398
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,540
<font color="yellow">Are you the driver Joon Soo mentioned about?</font>

399
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, it must be me. Nice to meet you.</font>

400
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,020
<font color="yellow">Granny, you seem uncomfortable. Should I slow down?</font>

401
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,580
<font color="yellow">Granny?</font>

402
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,450
<font color="yellow">You're friendly.</font>

403
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not in a hurry.</font>

404
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,480
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

405
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,280
<font color="yellow">My wife wants...</font>

406
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,550
<font color="yellow">to thank you.</font>

407
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,240
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

408
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,920
<font color="yellow">She wants to go with you to a bazaar held by millionaires' wives.</font>

409
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,520
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'm suitable to attend such an event.</font>

410
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
<font color="yellow">There's no harm in attending it. It's a meeting of high societies.</font>

411
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,680
<font color="yellow">My wife is on her way here, so get ready.</font>

412
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,380
<font color="yellow">She will be here in an hour or two.</font>

413
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,720
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

414
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,720
<font color="yellow">I'm not dressed well today.</font>

415
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,980
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

416
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,350
<font color="yellow">Good evening.</font>

417
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,820
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

418
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,720
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello.</font>

419
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,050
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

420
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,950
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Move aside.</font>

421
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,120
<font color="yellow">Hello. Hello.</font>

422
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,150
<font color="yellow">Please bring these to your sister.</font>

423
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,670
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the academy.</font>

424
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,070
<font color="yellow">You can go there right after. Hurry. Your sister needs them.</font>

425
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,160
<font color="yellow">Tell her I have an upset stomach.</font>

426
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,050
<font color="yellow">Mum! Mum!</font>

427
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

428
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,180
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you here, Mum? I'm waiting outside.</font>

429
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,250
<font color="yellow">What? Shim's coming here?</font>

430
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,910
<font color="yellow">How could you think of sending her?</font>

431
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,270
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking? What if people in the office see her?</font>

432
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't believe this.</font>

433
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,150
<font color="yellow">When did she leave?</font>

434
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,350
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'd better hang up now.</font>

435
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,250
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

436
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,780
<font color="yellow">It's you.</font>

437
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,250
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

438
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,750
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

439
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,220
<font color="yellow">My wife arrived early and called me to come down.</font>

440
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,980
<font color="yellow">Is your wife in front of the building?</font>

441
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

442
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,550
<font color="yellow">I must introduce you to each other.</font>

443
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,420
<font color="yellow">You could go straight to the bazaar together.</font>

444
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

445
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,250
<font color="yellow">(You must pretend...)</font>

446
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,950
<font color="yellow">You must pretend we don't know each other. Hide.</font>

447
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,350
<font color="yellow">- What is she saying?
-  Honey.</font>

448
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,510
<font color="yellow">You're early. Say hello.</font>

449
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,520
<font color="yellow">This is my beloved wife.</font>

450
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,980
<font color="yellow">This is Lawyer Gong Mi.</font>

451
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,700
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

452
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,780
<font color="yellow">My name is Gong Mi. Glad to see you.</font>

453
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,770
<font color="yellow">Nice to see you, Lawyer Gong.</font>

454
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,550
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your recent work. Well done.</font>

455
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

456
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,880
<font color="yellow">Who do you think I am to talk back?</font>

457
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,620
<font color="yellow">My pleasure, Ma'am. Thank you.</font>

458
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,980
<font color="yellow">The rumours are true. You are very beautiful.</font>

459
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,820
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

460
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,450
<font color="yellow">- Honey, we'd better leave now.
-  All right.</font>

461
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,170
<font color="yellow">Have a good time.</font>

462
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,870
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

463
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,880

00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,930
<font color="yellow">If you aimed for the secretary position looking like that,</font>

772
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,680
<font color="yellow">you must be out of your mind.</font>

773
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but let me tell you this before I leave.</font>

774
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,780
<font color="yellow">Is it fun to make fun of other people's looks?</font>

775
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,950
<font color="yellow">You're not living in Chosun Dynasty. Secretaries are not gisaeng.</font>

776
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,520
<font color="yellow">Your minds are so out dated.</font>

777
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,050
<font color="yellow">That's why people make fun of old men like you these days.</font>

778
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,880
<font color="yellow">Can you even get what I'm saying?</font>

779
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,850
<font color="yellow">People compare men like you to a dog.</font>

780
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,840
<font color="yellow">Behave yourself!</font>

781
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, men like you start yelling once they have nothing to say.</font>

782
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,720
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. You are embarrassing your kids.</font>

783
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,770
<font color="yellow">If you don't understand what I'm saying, memorise it.</font>

784
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,020
<font color="yellow">Remember how people call men like you. A dog!</font>

785
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,720
<font color="yellow">Sorry for making a fuss.</font>

786
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,620
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

787
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,150
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? She is driving me nuts.</font>

788
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,650
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

789
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,450
<font color="yellow">She is crazy. Why did you provoke her?</font>

790
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,790
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have planted flower seeds.</font>

791
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,880
<font color="yellow">What I should have planted were poisonous plant seeds.</font>

792
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,850
<font color="yellow">Hello, Manager.</font>

793
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,080
<font color="yellow">What? At the gas station?</font>

794
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,580

796
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,650

797
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,980

801
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,580

00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,620

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

807
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,650
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

808
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,620
<font color="yellow">I just apologised to Gong Shim.</font>

809
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,220
<font color="yellow">You did the right thing.</font>

810
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,080
<font color="yellow">I'll erase the recording.</font>

811

821
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,220
<font color="yellow">Did something good happen today?</font>

822
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,350
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

823
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,880
<font color="yellow">You are humming. Is there something to celebrate?</font>

824
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,680
<font color="yellow">Well, I guess a bit.</font>

825
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,850
<font color="yellow">Good for you then.</font>

826
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,700
<font color="yellow">Be careful. This is a poisonous plant.</font>

827

<font color="yellow">You'll die if you eat this.</font>

828

829
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,350
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use it when I need it.</font>

830
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,850
<font color="yellow">Why would you ever...</font>

831
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,720
<font color="yellow">need a poisonous plant?</font>

832
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,830
<font color="yellow">If you grill samgyeopsal, people will complain about the smoke.</font>

833
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,320
<font color="yellow">I'll just grill some sausages, so there won't be much smoke.</font>

834
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,480
<font color="yellow">Do you like sausages?</font>

835
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,380
<font color="yellow">Not really. I prefer sundae.</font>

836

<font color="yellow">Do you happen to have any vegetables?</font>

841
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,550
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do.</font>

842
