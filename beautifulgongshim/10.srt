163
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,810
<font color="yellow">Why is she running away?</font>

164
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,810
<font color="yellow">Shim's sister?</font>

165

<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

168
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,010
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

169
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you run away? I was happy to see you.</font>

170
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,280
<font color="yellow">I never...</font>

171
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,410
<font color="yellow">ran away from you.</font>

172
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,010
<font color="yellow">Did you call me?</font>

173
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,210
<font color="yellow">I was in a rush, so I didn't hear you.</font>

174
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,540
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you work at this company?</font>

175
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,680
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

176
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,690
<font color="yellow">I recently got hired.</font>

177

<font color="yellow">Shim recently got fired from...</font>

179
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,680
<font color="yellow">Please. Let me say this while we're on the topic.</font>

180
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,560
<font color="yellow">You know that Shim was fired on bad terms, right?</font>

181
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,480
<font color="yellow">So I haven't told anyone that I'm her sister yet.</font>

182
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,580
<font color="yellow">Is that how it goes?</font>

183
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,520
<font color="yellow">Please don't act like you know me in front of other people.</font>

184

<font color="yellow">Also, please don't tell anyone that I'm Shim's sister.</font>

185

186
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,960
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't tell anyone,</font>

187
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,840
<font color="yellow">but I doubt the secret will last long.</font>

188
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,610
<font color="yellow">You should just be honest and work in peace.</font>

189
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,890
<font color="yellow">I plan on telling them soon.</font>

190
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,150
<font color="yellow">Sure. I understand.</font>

191
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,020
<font color="yellow">We're neighbours and all.</font>

192

<font color="yellow">Hey, Shim's sister!</font>

196
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,510
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious why I'm here?</font>

197
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,620
<font color="yellow">My friend owns this company, you know.</font>

198
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,720

199

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,250
<font color="yellow">Yes. How have you been?</font>

205
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,840
<font color="yellow">Good. I didn't get to properly greet you since you started work.</font>

206
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,790
<font color="yellow">I had the restaurant opening, then the deal with the United States...</font>

207
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,460
<font color="yellow">along with the new product development. I've been very busy.</font>

208

<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

209
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,510

210
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry? Tomorrow?</font>

211
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,080
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you'd like to have dinner together.</font>

212
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,810
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to thank you properly yet.</font>

214
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,080
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's good.</font>

215
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,210
<font color="yellow">I'm going up.</font>

216
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,810

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

221
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,320
<font color="yellow">I'm at the Jeju International Airport.</font>

222
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,810
<font color="yellow">We were chasing the branch manager, but we lost him.</font>

223
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,180
<font color="yellow">He just got on a plane.</font>

224
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,070
<font color="yellow">Go to Gimpo International Airport and catch him.</font>

225
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,310
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

226
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,830
<font color="yellow">Just hold him for 30 minutes.</font>

227

<font color="yellow">We'll take the plane over to Seoul right now.</font>

228
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,040
<font color="yellow">Hurry, Ms Gong. We have to make him pay us.</font>

229
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,410
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm hanging up.</font>

230
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,760
<font color="yellow">You scared me. Where are you going?</font>

231
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,680
<font color="yellow">I have no time to talk. I have to go catch the branch manager.</font>

232

<font color="yellow">The thief who never paid you?</font>

233
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,650
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

234
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,160
<font color="yellow">You have to hold onto him for 30 minutes at the airport?</font>

235
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,290
<font color="yellow">Yes. Otherwise, he'll run away straight to China.</font>

236
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,130
<font color="yellow">If he escapes, it'll be over for us.</font>

237
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,020

238

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,000
<font color="yellow">You surprised me.</font>

314
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,510
<font color="yellow">Why are you surprised? Who were you talking to?</font>

315
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,710
<font color="yellow">Director Seok.</font>

316
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,620
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have anyone to eat dinner with. He wants to go out.</font>

317
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,840
<font color="yellow">You're free, right?</font>

318
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,640
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the office.</font>

319
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,110
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

320
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,660
<font color="yellow">He said he'd come to pick us up.</font>

321
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,750
<font color="yellow">You guys should go ahead.</font>

322
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,580
<font color="yellow">I'll join later if I can.</font>

323
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,550
<font color="yellow">I should have asked you first.</font>

324
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,350
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be free.</font>

325
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,580
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

326
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,380
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should ask him to eat another time.</font>

327
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,110
<font color="yellow">There's no need.</font>

328
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,740
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

329
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,580
<font color="yellow">Is it for me?</font>

330
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,980
<font color="yellow">You drew me pictures before, right?</font>

331
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,700
<font color="yellow">(I told you to come home early, didn't I?)</font>

332
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,200
<font color="yellow">(I left the meal here since it's too late.)</font>

333
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,040
<font color="yellow">(Don't forget to take your medication.)</font>

334
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,180
<font color="yellow">It cheered me up...</font>

335
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,580
<font color="yellow">when I saw your drawings.</font>

336
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,380
<font color="yellow">I want you to continue to draw.</font>

337
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,210
<font color="yellow">I'm your fan.</font>

338
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sure even the most famous artist started with a single fan.</font>

339
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,280
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll use them well.</font>

340
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,410
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

341
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,710
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

342
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,290
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, I have to go to the office. I can't come.</font>

343
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,640
<font color="yellow">You two should enjoy dinner on your own.</font>

344
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,210
<font color="yellow">I agreed to dinner without knowing that Dan Tae was busy.</font>

345
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,040
<font color="yellow">Really? What should we do?</font>

346
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,080
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't take too long, we can wait for you.</font>

347
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,080
<font color="yellow">I don't think today will work for me.</font>

348
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,590
<font color="yellow">We can go next time.</font>

349
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,180
<font color="yellow">That's too bad.</font>

350
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,550
<font color="yellow">Shim promised to treat me with her first pay check.</font>

351
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,880
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of going somewhere really expensive.</font>

352
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,710
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's going to be expensive.</font>

353
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,510
<font color="yellow">You should get ready. You promised.</font>

354
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,710
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Rich people are worse.</font>

355
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,890
<font color="yellow">We can just get street food, then.</font>

356
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,790
<font color="yellow">We can get gimbap, fish cake and tteokbokki.</font>

357
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,740
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Gosh.</font>

358
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,110
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your dinner. I'll be going.</font>

359
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,710
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

360
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

361
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,580
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

362
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,710
<font color="yellow">Aunt Ji Won.</font>

363
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,140
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of Dad.</font>

364
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I had you working where we didn't make any money.</font>

365
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,860
<font color="yellow">You should take this time to get some rest.</font>

366
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,840
<font color="yellow">Okay. I understand.</font>

367
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,250
<font color="yellow">I'll go see him everyday.</font>

368
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,110
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about him.</font>

369
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,610
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

370
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,740
<font color="yellow">I heard you're going to work at Star Group.</font>

371
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,780
<font color="yellow">How did you manage to get a job there?</font>

372
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,410
<font color="yellow">It's my friend's company. I applied for an opening.</font>

373
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,380
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

374
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,880
<font color="yellow">I was worried about you working as a driver at night.</font>

375
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,180
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

376
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,110
<font color="yellow">Make sure to be polite to your superiors. Okay?</font>

377
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,110
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. I'm not a kid.</font>

378
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,040
<font color="yellow">This restaurant is expensive.</font>

379
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,310
<font color="yellow">But I promised the director that I'd buy him dinner.</font>

380
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,710
<font color="yellow">So I'll just skip dinner for a few days.</font>

381
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,040
<font color="yellow">Are you Gong Shim?</font>

382
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,010
<font color="yellow">You are.</font>

383
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,810
<font color="yellow">I kept wondering if it was you.</font>

384
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,410
<font color="yellow">Eun Jin?</font>

385
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,710
<font color="yellow">It's so nice to see you.</font>

386
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,310
<font color="yellow">This is the first time seeing you after graduation.</font>

387
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,310
<font color="yellow">You're the only one I haven't heard from amongst our friends.</font>

388
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,040
<font color="yellow">I know. Things just turned out like that.</font>

389
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,210
<font color="yellow">Well, it's good to see you, too.</font>

390
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,200
<font color="yellow">How are you doing?</font>

391
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,580
<font color="yellow">What's your job?</font>

392
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,940
<font color="yellow">Where do you work?</font>

393
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
<font color="yellow">I'm still looking for a job.</font>

394
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,180
<font color="yellow">So that's why I couldn't hear anything from you.</font>

395
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,690
<font color="yellow">It's not like it's a crime to be jobless.</font>

396
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,320
<font color="yellow">How can you cut off all contact?</font>

397
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,840
<font color="yellow">Keep in touch, Shim.</font>

398
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,310
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

399
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,980
<font color="yellow">She's Gong Shim, my high school friend.</font>

400
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,440
<font color="yellow">Isn't she cute?</font>

401
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,640
<font color="yellow">Shim, this is my boyfriend.</font>

402
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,110
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

403
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,380
<font color="yellow">Although you two are friends,</font>

404
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,510
<font color="yellow">you're really different compared to Eun Jin.</font>

405
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,940
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

406
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,810
<font color="yellow">By the way, let me tell you.</font>

407
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,560
<font color="yellow">Her sister takes after their mother.</font>

408
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,980
<font color="yellow">So she's really tall, pretty and smart, too.</font>

409
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,980
<font color="yellow">But Shim takes after her father, so she's short, ugly...</font>

410
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,480
<font color="yellow">and cute. They were really famous at our school.</font>

411
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,490
<font color="yellow">She and her sister went to the same school,</font>

412
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,280
<font color="yellow">but they were the exact opposite of each other.</font>

413
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,910
<font color="yellow">By the way, who did you come here with?</font>

414
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,940
<font color="yellow">This restaurant is quite expensive.</font>

415
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,680
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

416
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,540
<font color="yellow">You must be Shim's friends.</font>

417
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,180
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

418
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,040
<font color="yellow">Hello, Director.</font>

419
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,040
<font color="yellow">Director?</font>

420
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,080
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Jung Ho, and I work in the Management Support Team.</font>

421
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,440
<font color="yellow">- It's an honour, Sir.
- I see.</font>

422
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,310
<font color="yellow">I guess you work at our company.</font>

423
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,480
<font color="yellow">What a coincidence. Nice to meet you.</font>

424
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,460
<font color="yellow">Is he the director of Star Group?</font>

425
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

426
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,020
<font color="yellow">Shim, is he your boyfriend?</font>

427
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,410
<font color="yellow">No, he's not.</font>

428
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,080
<font color="yellow">I thought so.</font>

429
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,210
<font color="yellow">I like her.</font>

430
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,300
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

431
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,610
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

432
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,680
<font color="yellow">like this young lady.</font>

433
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,680
<font color="yellow">I hope I didn't...</font>

434
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,210
<font color="yellow">cross a line and make you feel uncomfortable.</font>

435
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,540
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I know I shouldn't be saying this,</font>

436
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,980
<font color="yellow">but I was really thankful.</font>

437
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,680
<font color="yellow">She ignored me a lot back in high school.</font>

438
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, then I should've acted more manly.</font>

439
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,710
<font color="yellow">That was more than enough. You looked really nice.</font>

440
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,110
<font color="yellow">Choose your menu.</font>

441
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,810
<font color="yellow">You have my stuff ready for me, right?</font>

442
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

443
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,210
<font color="yellow">I kept it ready for you.</font>

444
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,780
<font color="yellow">You really are trustworthy.</font>

445
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,180
<font color="yellow">Okay. Keep up the good work.</font>

446
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

447
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,450
<font color="yellow">Don't you get sick of eating the same thing over and over again?</font>

448
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,820
<font color="yellow">If I get hooked on something,</font>

449
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,990
<font color="yellow">no matter what it is or what it does,</font>

450
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,880
<font color="yellow">I don't easily get sick of it, and I keep liking it for a long time.</font>

451
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,680
<font color="yellow">You can say that I'm full of pure love.</font>

452
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,590
<font color="yellow">- Can I pay now?
- Okay.</font>

453
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,710
<font color="yellow">I almost forgot.</font>

454
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,110
<font color="yellow">There they are.</font>

455
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,580
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

456
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,450
<font color="yellow">I had a great day thanks to you.</font>

457
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,880
<font color="yellow">The dinner was nice, too.</font>

458
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,140
<font color="yellow">Bye, Director.</font>

459
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,780
<font color="yellow">I had a great time, too.</font>

460
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,310
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

461
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,210
<font color="yellow">Isn't he home yet?</font>

462
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,010
<font color="yellow">The lights are on inside.</font>

463
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,310
<font color="yellow">Did he leave the house with the lights on?</font>

464
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,590
<font color="yellow">Did you just get back?</font>

465
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,980
<font color="yellow">It would've been great if you came to dinner with us.</font>

466
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,140
<font color="yellow">It was really delicious.</font>

467
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,620
<font color="yellow">I thought of you while eating. You would've liked the food there.</font>

468
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,410
<font color="yellow">The atmosphere was really nice, too.</font>

469
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,940
<font color="yellow">You like those kind of places, right?</font>

470
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, anyway,</font>

471
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,710
<font color="yellow">you missed out on great food today.</font>

472
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,750
<font color="yellow">Let's go there together someday.</font>

473
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,980
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you to dinner.</font>

474
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,210
<font color="yellow">Okay then. Good night.</font>

475
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,710
<font color="yellow">Be sure to buy me a meal next time.</font>

476
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,980
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

477
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,550
<font color="yellow">helped you get your first pay check.</font>

478
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,740
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

479
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

480
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,210
<font color="yellow">Why were you standing still?</font>

481
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,890
<font color="yellow">What did you expect?</font>

482
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,440
<font color="yellow">You should've come down quickly.</font>

483
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:04,940
<font color="yellow">Secretary Doe, you did a great job supporting the chairman until now.</font>

484
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

485
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,810
<font color="yellow">I heard you're the vice-president of the Chinese branch now.</font>

486
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,990
<font color="yellow">What an unprecedented promotion.</font>

487
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,110
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

488
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,640
<font color="yellow">By the way, who will be the chairman's next secretary?</font>

489
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,190
<font color="yellow">Has anything been confirmed?</font>

490
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,580
<font color="yellow">I don't really know yet.</font>

491
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,010
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard anything about it from the secretary office.</font>

492
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,050
<font color="yellow">I'm certain she won't leave the position vacant.</font>

493
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,210
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

494
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,740
<font color="yellow">The chairman should hurry up and hire a secretary.</font>

495
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,310
<font color="yellow">Well, let's go in first.</font>

496
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,840
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

497
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,980
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

498
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,310
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

499
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,810
<font color="yellow">Isn't he Ahn Dan Tae?</font>

500
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,710
<font color="yellow">Who does he think he is?</font>

501
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,050
<font color="yellow">How dare he?</font>

502
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,550
<font color="yellow">Hey! Get up right now!</font>

503
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,840
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'll be working as the chairman's secretary from today.</font>

504
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,580
<font color="yellow">I'm the bright and cheerful Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

505
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,410
<font color="yellow">What? Secretary?</font>

506
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,690
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is this?</font>

507
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,410
<font color="yellow">Who are you trying to fool?</font>

508
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,280
<font color="yellow">You better leave before we call the security and drag you out.</font>

509
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,910
<font color="yellow">What's going on here?</font>

510
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you ordering my secretary to leave?</font>

511
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

512
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,910
<font color="yellow">So this person...</font>

513
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,520
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae is your secretary?</font>

514
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,940
<font color="yellow">I hired him temporarily since we have a vacant secretary position.</font>

515
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,150
<font color="yellow">If you don't do your work properly,</font>

516
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,810
<font color="yellow">I'm going to send you straight home, so do things right.</font>

517
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,740
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare try to slack off.</font>

518
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

519
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,850
<font color="yellow">But I don't understand.</font>

520
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,340
<font color="yellow">Even if that's the case,</font>

521
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,480
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's appropriate to hire him...</font>

522
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,880
<font color="yellow">when he has no experience at all.</font>

523
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,110
<font color="yellow">Seok Dae Hwang.</font>

524
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,580
<font color="yellow">Did you become the president because you had any experience?</font>

525
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,320
<font color="yellow">Well, in my case...</font>

526
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,380
<font color="yellow">I need to get going. Get my bag, and come with me.</font>

527
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

528
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,460
<font color="yellow">What? Ahn Dan Tae is the son of whom?</font>

529
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,000
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae is the son of Ahn Soo Yong...</font>

530
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,210
<font color="yellow">who took Joon Pyo 26 years ago.</font>

531
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,120
<font color="yellow">And you let him work here even when you knew that?</font>

532
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,920
<font color="yellow">He doesn't know anything anyway.</font>

533
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,720
<font color="yellow">He hasn't been in touch with his dad for a long time.</font>

534
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,440
<font color="yellow">Besides, Soo Yong is pretty much a criminal, too.</font>

535
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,060
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't have said anything to his son.</font>

536
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,190
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Just know that it bothers me.</font>

537
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,740
<font color="yellow">I hope you take care of things. I don't want to see him around.</font>

538
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,710
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

539
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,610
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

540
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,610
<font color="yellow">You're not here to dig anything up, are you?</font>

541
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,510
<font color="yellow">One more lap, here we go.</font>

542
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,810
<font color="yellow">Look at me. I look so cool.</font>

543
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,640
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What is he doing up there?</font>

544
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,080
<font color="yellow">Make a curve.</font>

545
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,860
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

546
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,580
<font color="yellow">(Secretary Goo)</font>

547
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,280
<font color="yellow">Secretary Goo.</font>

548
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,880
<font color="yellow">Calling me like this won't get you your job back.</font>

549
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,440
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Your driving is really amazing.</font>

550
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,810
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

551
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,380
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

552
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,210
<font color="yellow">Sir?</font>

553
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,050
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

554
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,360
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to be working. Why... Why are you riding this?</font>

555
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,420
<font color="yellow">- It's fun, isn't it?
- Nonsense.</font>

556
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,680
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

557
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,340
<font color="yellow">Anyway, if I tell you not to do something, don't do it.</font>

558
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,900
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Yes?</font>

559
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,320
<font color="yellow">You get a break when you're done cleaning this place, right?</font>

560
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,430
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Then how about a final lap?</font>

561
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,620
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

562
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,880
<font color="yellow">- Let's go!
- Let's do this!</font>

563
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,410
<font color="yellow">Faster.</font>

564
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,880
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I didn't bring my mascara today.</font>

565
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,120
<font color="yellow">Hello, it is very nice to meet you.</font>

566
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,620
<font color="yellow">- Come in.
- Here.</font>

567
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,060
<font color="yellow">I brought you all some sweet coffee.</font>

568
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,450
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- You all should say hi.</font>

569
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,790
<font color="yellow">He is the chairman's new secretary.</font>

570
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,190
<font color="yellow">His name is Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

571
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,550
<font color="yellow">I see. He used to be a lawyer, right?</font>

572
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,440
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

573
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,020
<font color="yellow">that he's extremely skilled.</font>

574
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,890
<font color="yellow">Is he the one who saved Director Seok from...</font>

575
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,190
<font color="yellow">being assaulted from violence last time?</font>

576
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's him. You have a good memory.</font>

577
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,820
<font color="yellow">- He is a great lawyer indeed.
- He is.</font>

578
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,480
<font color="yellow">You see, that's really not a big deal.</font>

579
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,280
<font color="yellow">Please don't hesitate to ask me anything.</font>

580
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,180
<font color="yellow">I'm living on a lease, and it's my seventh month living there.</font>

581
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,190
<font color="yellow">But the landowner suddenly told me to move out.</font>

582
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,440
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

583
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,260
<font color="yellow">According to the law of Housing Lease Protection,</font>

584
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,290
<font color="yellow">your lease should be protected for at least two years.</font>

585
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,950
<font color="yellow">So your landowner can't kick you out that easily.</font>

586
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,880
<font color="yellow">- He or she has no right to do that.
- Wow.</font>

587
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,520
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

588
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,280
<font color="yellow">I thought I had to leave right away. I was worried day and night.</font>

589
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,820
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Thank you.</font>

590
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,730
<font color="yellow">If your landowner still forces you to leave, let me know.</font>

591
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,310
<font color="yellow">I will take care of that for you.</font>

592
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,980
<font color="yellow">You're amazing.</font>

593
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,890
<font color="yellow">By the way, do you also...</font>

594
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,160
<font color="yellow">clean the executives' offices and restrooms?</font>

595
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,260
<font color="yellow">Not just that. We also clean...</font>

596
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,110
<font color="yellow">restrooms and secretary offices. We take care of everything.</font>

597
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,560
<font color="yellow">We do have our own areas to clean. But before they show up,</font>

598
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,490
<font color="yellow">we just jump in and start cleaning together...</font>

599
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,640
<font color="yellow">as soon as our chief janitor unlocks the offices.</font>

600
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,880
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

601
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,080
<font color="yellow">If you need anything, let me know any time.</font>

602
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,110
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay. Enjoy your coffee.</font>

603
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,480
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- No problem.</font>

604
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,440
<font color="yellow">- He is handsome.
- He is.</font>

605
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,380
<font color="yellow">Hello, Director Seok.</font>

606
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,340
<font color="yellow">You calling me that makes me feel awkward.</font>

607
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,120
<font color="yellow">Where are you coming from?</font>

608
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,740
<font color="yellow">I just found the shortcut to the cafeteria.</font>

609
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,140
<font color="yellow">What made you decide to work here?</font>

610
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,210
<font color="yellow">Well, it's kind of embarrassing.</font>

611
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,640
<font color="yellow">But I needed to earn some money.</font>

612
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,880
<font color="yellow">My aunt, whom I've been living with since I was young,</font>

613
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,740
<font color="yellow">guaranteed her friend's debt, so we started struggling financially.</font>

614
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,440
<font color="yellow">Did Dan Tae tell you what had happened to him...</font>

615
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,100
<font color="yellow">lately?</font>

616
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know the specific details.</font>

617
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,710
<font color="yellow">But I heard he had some family issues.</font>

618
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,520
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

619
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,980
<font color="yellow">Yes, so I called the chairman to ask for a job.</font>

620
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,050
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

621
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,190
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that you became the chairman's secretary.</font>

622
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,480
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

623
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,590
<font color="yellow">Then should I bring you something to drink?</font>

624
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,980
<font color="yellow">We have iced Americano, lukewarm Americano, and hot Americano.</font>

625
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,360
<font color="yellow">- No, thank you.
- Okay.</font>

626
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,190
<font color="yellow">I want to celebrate your first day of work.</font>

627
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,980
<font color="yellow">But I have an appointment today.</font>

628
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,910
<font color="yellow">We should meet up soon though.</font>

629
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director.</font>

630
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,310
<font color="yellow">Please don't call me that when it's just the two of us.</font>

631

633
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,510
<font color="yellow">Take care, Director.</font>

634
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,880
<font color="yellow">Have a good day, Sir.</font>

635
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

636
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,620
<font color="yellow">I'm happy to see you again, Shim.</font>

637
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,910
<font color="yellow">But I don't know if I should be too happy about you being jobless again.</font>

638
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,780
<font color="yellow">When did you come back?</font>

639
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,880
<font color="yellow">It's been a week.</font>

640
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,720
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it feel like we got dragged back here after becoming jobless?</font>

641
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,580
<font color="yellow">Is this place a jail to you or what?</font>

642
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,200
<font color="yellow">We get paid at this jail. I like it.</font>

<font color="yellow">You guys are funny.</font>

644

729
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,290
<font color="yellow">Mi will never be able to talk about her family at work.</font>

00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,360
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. Is this it?</font>

738
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please give it to her for me.</font>

739

<font color="yellow">Isn't that Secretary Gong?</font>

740
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,480
<font color="yellow">So I guess the two of them...</font>

741
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,690
<font color="yellow">are quite close seeing that she's even giving him packed lunch.</font>

742
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,550
<font color="yellow">I'll give this to your sister for you.</font>

744
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,080
<font color="yellow">Hey, you don't look so well.</font>

745
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,810
<font color="yellow">Is everything all right?</font>

746
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,280
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

747
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,440
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because it's my first time working at a company.</font>

748
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,940
<font color="yellow">It's tough to work at a company. Hang in there.</font>

749
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,810
<font color="yellow">If you need any tips, feel free to ask me.</font>

750

<font color="yellow">Understood, Ma'am.</font>

751
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,810
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

752
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,780
<font color="yellow">There was poisoned water at the board meeting?</font>

753
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,510
<font color="yellow">Well, the thing is,</font>

754
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,690
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking that someone...</font>

755
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,780
<font color="yellow">targeted your secretary, Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

756
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,960
<font color="yellow">But because of Ahn Dan Tae, the other board members...</font>

757
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,940
<font color="yellow">are feeling very uneasy and worried.</font>

758
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,530
<font color="yellow">He requested for...</font>

759
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,110
<font color="yellow">a pharmaceutical analysis on the poison that was in the water.</font>

760
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,540
<font color="yellow">Apparently, it was potassium cyanide.</font>

761
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,320
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a fatal dose. There was very little of it.</font>

762
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,310
<font color="yellow">Who in the world did such a terrible thing?</font>

763
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,980
<font color="yellow">We checked the security cameras.</font>

764
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,540
<font color="yellow">But there were no outsiders near the meeting room that day.</font>

765
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,820
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

766
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,690
<font color="yellow">Just know that it bothers me.</font>

767
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,180
<font color="yellow">I hope you take care of things. I don't want to see him around.</font>

768
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,640
<font color="yellow">Does that mean my brother is behind this?</font>

769
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,010
<font color="yellow">Enhance the security at the company.</font>

770
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,090
<font color="yellow">And find who's behind all this.</font>

771
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,570
<font color="yellow">I will. I made sure to keep this confidential so that...</font>

772
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,110
<font color="yellow">no one outside of the company will find out.</font>

773
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,960
<font color="yellow">Do you remember?</font>

774
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,490
<font color="yellow">When our husband was alive, someone was threatening him.</font>

775
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,660
<font color="yellow">He almost died from that poison in his drink.</font>

776
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,590
<font color="yellow">We rushed to the hospital and spent all night crying.</font>

777
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,440
<font color="yellow">It was chaotic. My goodness.</font>

778
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,210
<font color="yellow">That day, you cried more than I did.</font>

779
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,630
<font color="yellow">You were crying for him even when he was cheating on you.</font>

780
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,260
<font color="yellow">She was crying her eyes out. You have no idea.</font>

781
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,670
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Mum. Here, try this.</font>

782
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,070
<font color="yellow">- Is this good?
- Yes, try it.</font>

783
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,440
<font color="yellow">- Let me try it then.
- Yes.</font>

784
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,680
<font color="yellow">Who could it be?</font>

785
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,840
<font color="yellow">Who's trying to get rid of me so soon?</font>

786
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,340
<font color="yellow">It was definitely a new water bottle.</font>

787
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,740
<font color="yellow">Was the potassium cyanide injected into the bottle?</font>

788
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,320
<font color="yellow">- You can put it on like this.
- Hello, everyone.</font>

789
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,700
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hey.</font>

790
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,190
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
- You're here.</font>

791
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,270
<font color="yellow">You should eat these while you rest.</font>

792
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,370
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

793
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,210
<font color="yellow">I washed these nice and clean.</font>

794
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,710
<font color="yellow">- So eat all you want.
- You're so kind.</font>

795
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,540
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

796
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,940
<font color="yellow">while you were cleaning,</font>

797
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,260
<font color="yellow">did you happen to see a syringe in the meeting room...</font>

798
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,190
<font color="yellow">or in any other places that you cleaned?</font>

799
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,180
<font color="yellow">- See what?
- A syringe?</font>

800
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,060
<font color="yellow">You mean, the one they use at hospitals?</font>

801
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,170
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

802
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,990
<font color="yellow">Did any of you see anything like that while cleaning?</font>

803
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,340
<font color="yellow">- I haven't.
- Me neither.</font>

804
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,180
<font color="yellow">Then how about a chemical or medical bottle?</font>

805
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,190
<font color="yellow">I've seen a bag of medicine for a cold.</font>

806
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,720
<font color="yellow">Well, if you happen to see a syringe or a medical bottle,</font>

807
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,580
<font color="yellow">please let me know, okay?</font>

808
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,910
<font color="yellow">The air among the board members is not pleasant these days.</font>

809
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,360
<font color="yellow">Even when we drink a cup of coffee, we get paranoid...</font>

810
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,880
<font color="yellow">thinking that it might be poisoned.</font>

811
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,450
<font color="yellow">Ever since the chairman hired a strange man as her secretary,</font>

812
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,610
<font color="yellow">things have become very awkward.</font>

813
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,140
<font color="yellow">That secretary has no class, and he's also arrogant.</font>

814
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,940
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

815
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,840
<font color="yellow">before anything worse happens,</font>

816
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,410
<font color="yellow">I think we should let go of Secretary Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

817
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,340
<font color="yellow">Let's all cooperate on that.</font>

818
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,740
<font color="yellow">If all of us agree on this matter,</font>

819
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,440
<font color="yellow">she won't be able to ignore our opinions.</font>

820
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,110
<font color="yellow">She will be here tomorrow.</font>

821
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:33,180
<font color="yellow">So everyone here should...</font>

822
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,940
<font color="yellow">cooperate on firing Secretary Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

823
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,880
<font color="yellow">Hand in your written opinions...</font>

824
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,880
<font color="yellow">to the chairman.</font>

825
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,910
<font color="yellow">I could get kicked out of this place like this.</font>

826
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,840
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you. Sure.</font>

827
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

828
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,440
<font color="yellow">Am I seeing things again?</font>

829
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,880
<font color="yellow">I should go see a doctor.</font>

830
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,740
<font color="yellow">Wait, this is real.</font>

831
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,700
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

832
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,010
<font color="yellow">Hello, Secretary Gong.</font>

833
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,510
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

834
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello. Have you been well?</font>

835
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,340
<font color="yellow">Of course. How about you, Sir? Did you stay well?</font>

836
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,860
<font color="yellow">Since I don't get to drink your oolong tea any more,</font>

837
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,540
<font color="yellow">I feel low and gloomy all the time.</font>

838
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,480
<font color="yellow">Sir, it's not very funny.</font>

839
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is it. This reaction.</font>

840
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,510
<font color="yellow">This is the reaction I've been missing.</font>

841
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,060
<font color="yellow">What? What just happened?</font>

842
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,910
<font color="yellow">Get him! That jerk!</font>

843
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,580
<font color="yellow">Now, they've started to harm people close to me.</font>

844
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,610
<font color="yellow">This must be a warning.</font>

845
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,640
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

846
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,780
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

847
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,880
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt?</font>

848
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,380
<font color="yellow">I didn't get hurt, but I was really surprised.</font>

849
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,820
<font color="yellow">You must have been startled.</font>

850
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,080
<font color="yellow">I was just surprised at first.</font>

851
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,140
<font color="yellow">But now, I'm really scared.</font>

852
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:43,140
<font color="yellow">Why would anyone do such a thing to me?</font>

853
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,710
<font color="yellow">It really scares me.</font>

854
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,180
<font color="yellow">I'll just put the clothes away.</font>

855
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,610
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

856
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,280
<font color="yellow">I know it'll be difficult for you to recall the moment,</font>

857
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,940
<font color="yellow">but can you explain specifically what happened?</font>

858
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:00,610
<font color="yellow">I won't let them get away with it.</font>

859
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,740
<font color="yellow">Did you see the face of the man who threw the paint ball?</font>

860
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,180
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to see his face since everything happened so suddenly.</font>

861
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,980
<font color="yellow">He was on a motorbike wearing a helmet, so I couldn't see.</font>

862
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,010
<font color="yellow">Did he say anything as he threw the paintball?</font>

863
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

864
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,340
<font color="yellow">It all happened out of the blue.</font>

865
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,440
<font color="yellow">Shim, try to calmly think it over.</font>

866
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,940
<font color="yellow">I went to the company to give the porridge to Mi,</font>

867
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,850
<font color="yellow">and that's when I met President Seok.</font>

868
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,410
<font color="yellow">We hadn't met in quite a while,</font>

869
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,440
<font color="yellow">so we were glad to see each other and were talking.</font>

870
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,980
<font color="yellow">Then a paintball suddenly came out of nowhere.</font>

871
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,780
<font color="yellow">You met the president?</font>

872
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,540

874
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,080

00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:05,190
<font color="yellow">Shim, don't get too scared, and just relax here.</font>

876
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,610
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

880
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,880

883
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,920
<font color="yellow">- Jong Chul!
- Secretary Goo?</font>

884

- She used to be my secretary.</font>

886
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:21,890
<font color="yellow">She nagged me to give her job back saying that she was fired unfairly.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

888
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,840
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

889
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,340
<font color="yellow">You must be the one who put poison in his water.</font>

890
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,140
<font color="yellow">It was easy for you to sneak in since you were his secretary.</font>

891

<font color="yellow">You even knew exactly where his seat was.</font>

892

<font color="yellow">You were also aiming for him when you threw the paintball.</font>

894
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,800

01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,610
<font color="yellow">will not be here today.</font>

925
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,680
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What is he talking about?</font>

926
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,480
<font color="yellow">We need to solve this problem.</font>

927
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,080
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

928
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,920
<font color="yellow">should we go to her office?</font>

929
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,980
<font color="yellow">Let's trust the chairman's judgement...</font>

930
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,890
<font color="yellow">regarding Secretary Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

931
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,210
<font color="yellow">But that crazy...</font>

932
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:42,210
<font color="yellow">He's just so strange. We can't let him be the chairman's secretary.</font>

933
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,480
<font color="yellow">This doesn't make any sense, does it?</font>

934
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,820
<font color="yellow">- Don't you agree?
- You are right.</font>

935
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,700
<font color="yellow">- This doesn't make sense.
- Why so suddenly?</font>

936
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,080
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

937
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,780
<font color="yellow">the chairman's secretary is Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

938
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,980
<font color="yellow">The meeting is dismissed.</font>

939
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,310
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Why is he acting weird again?</font>
