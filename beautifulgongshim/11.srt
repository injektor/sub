00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,210
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,200
What's wrong with me? I need to cook rice first.

3
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,130
(Five minutes left)

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
Hey, Dan Tae.

5
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,910
What's all this?

6
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,420
It's your breakfast.

7
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,730
You need to get ready for work. Let's eat quickly.

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,980
Let me carry it for you.

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,730
Don't worry. Let's go inside.

10
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,700
Okay.

11
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,430
Here. Go ahead and eat.

12
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,760
All right.

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,060
Try this, too.

14
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,260
Shim.

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Thank you for the meal. It was so good.

16
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,000
Drink some water.

17
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,330
Thank you.

18
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm a lucky man.

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,340
Thank you so much.

20
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,010
If this is what you call lucky,

21
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,030
I can do this for you for a hundred more years.

22
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,660
Really?

23
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,860
Why is it so hot in here?

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,700
It is, right?

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Yes.

26
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,130
Don't feel uncomfortable in front of me.

27
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,760
You can take your wig off.

28
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,000
Excuse me?

29
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,600
We're close enough. Don't worry.

30
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,350
You can take it off if it's too hot.

31
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,900
Let me help you.

32
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,430
Hold on.

33
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,230
I know we're close and all.

34
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,160
But how can I show you the big hole I have from hair loss?

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,500
Where is it?

36
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,730
Shim!

37
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,600
You hair grew back.

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,330
There is no hole any more!

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,560
Really?

40
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

41
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,600
The hole is gone. It's now covered up with your new hair!

42
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,400
Oh, goodness!

43
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,430
Congratulations.

44
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,560
Wow.

45
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,430
Yes, I love you.

46
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,030
You love me?

47
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,300
Your rice is ready.

48
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,360
What?

49
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,360
I fell asleep?

50
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,300
Hey, Dan Tae.

51
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Ahn Dan Tae.

52
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,200
I guess he went to work early today.

53
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,800
(I found this at the Yangpyeong arboretum. It looks valuable.)

54
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,910
How have you been, Sir?

55
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,600
Good. Come here.

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay.

57
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,290
My dear Ho Joong. Are you doing well?

58
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes. Thanks to you, I'm doing great these days.

59
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,240
You said you wanted to ask me a favour, right?

60
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,020
Can you please deliver this for me?

61
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,530
Of course.

62
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,760
Where should I deliver it to?

63
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Please deliver this to Star Group's information desk...

64
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,000
about an hour later.

65
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,100
After an hour, deliver this to Star Group's building. Got it.

66
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,990
Don't tell anyone that I sent it.

67
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,100
Got it.

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Thank you.

69
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,430
- I'll get going.
 - Okay. Bye.

70
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,200
I don't understand.

71
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,200
He should've gotten a job at a cleaning company.

72
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,230
I don't understand why he started working as a secretary.

73
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,960
Shall we go?

74
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,800
Excuse me, Sir.

75
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,230
Someone delivered this for you.

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,060
What's this?

77
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,830
Isn't this the badge for our executives?

78
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,720
"I found this at the Yangpyeong arboretum."

79
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,550
"It looks valuable."

80
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,330
"I hope it get backs to the owner."

81
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,300
There is no such thing.

82
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,990
How much does he know?

83
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,280
I said, he doesn't know anything.

84
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,300
You little...

85
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,900
Tell me everything.

86
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,600
What is this?

87
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,360
Who in the world is careless enough to lose their badge?

88
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,860
President Seok.

89
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,530
Executive Director Yeom.

90
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,110
You two should lead a good example.

91
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,330
This badge wasn't some kind of gift for you to keep in your drawer.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,500
You only wear it for the board meeting that I attend.

93
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,960
How many times did I tell you to wear it everyday?

94
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,100
I'm going to find out who this badge belongs to.

95
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,860
Yes, Ma'am.

96
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,000
Secretary Ahn.

97
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,360
Find out who lost their executive's badge.

98
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,240
An executive's badge?

99
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,610
It's a badge only for the executives.

100
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,430
Do you think someone who retired could've held onto it?

101
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,170
It was made a year ago when we changed our company logo.

102
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,370
And you're supposed to return it to the company when you leave.

103
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,960
There was once a fraud case by someone who picked up the badge.

104
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,870
Secretary Ahn.

105
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,060
Take care of this right now and report back to me.

106
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes, Ma'am.

107
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
Secretary Ahn?

108
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,930
Thanks for your work, Sir.

109
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,430
What work?

110
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,500
I was just checking if you were wearing your badge.

111
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,630
(Check)

112
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,060
You scared me.

113
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,660
Secretary Ahn?

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,330
Thanks for your cooperation,

115
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,970
Director Moon.

116
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,180
I was checking if you were wearing your badge.

117
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,260
(Checked)

118
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100
My goodness.

119
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,630
What's up with him checking our badges?

120
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,930
You'll get in trouble if you lend your badge to others.

121
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,370
- What?
 - What?

122
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,080
That's what the chairman said.

123
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,200
That little...

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Come in.

125
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,060
Hey, Secretary Ahn.

126
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,980
Hello, Sir. How are you?

127
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm here to check if you are wearing your badge.

128
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Are you?

129
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,260
Please leave if you're done looking. I'm quite busy at the moment.

130
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,660
Why are you just standing there?

131
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,370
It's here.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,100
Where is it?

133
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,340
It's gone.

134
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,480
Where did it go?

135
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,130
When did you lose it?

136
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,030
I didn't lose it.

137
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,650
I have it.

138
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,640
You saw my badge this morning. You saw me, right?

139
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
My badge was right here.

140
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,530
No, I didn't see it.

141
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,060
You didn't?

142
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,830
May I ask where you went this morning?

143
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,370
I went to meet...

144
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,830
some people in the sports industry and...

145
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,130
some people from the Animal Protection Society.

146
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,420
I will go check if you lost it during those meetings then.

147
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,090
No, you don't have to.

148
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,190
I can check. I think I know where it is.

149
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,690
Once you find your badge, let me know as soon as possible.

150
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,230
The chairman is waiting for my report.

151
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,560
Okay, I'll let you know.

152
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,870
Where did it go?

153
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,000
Seriously.

154
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,230
- Go, go!
 - Go, go!

155
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,360
I don't think I dropped it here.

156
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,920
Where did I lose it?

157
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,060
Hey, Judy! Judy, come here.

158
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,460
My goodness. Judy.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,230
Good.

160
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,950
You came here twice today.

161
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,490
Have you seen a little badge here?

162
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,330
It's a small badge I wear.

163
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,120
No, I haven't.

164
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,320
I'll let you know if I see it.

165
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,830
It's not here? I see.

166
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,430
This is not good.

167
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,230
I'll be in trouble.

168
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,230
Where are you going, Judy? Come here, Judy.

169
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

170
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,520
Are you hungry, Judy?

171
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,430
Let's eat then. Let's...

172
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,260
I found my badge.

173
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,830
Hey, Judy.

174
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,720
Did you find this? You kept my badge here. Wow.

175
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,730
I found it.

176
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,300
Good job, Judy.

177
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,800
He's not here.

178
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,530
Director Seok has gone out for a while.

179
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,330
Really? Where did he go?

180
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,730
I'm not sure about that.

181
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,260
Should I leave him a message?

182
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,240
I'm here to check if he is wearing his badge.

183
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,730
He is the last one I need to check.

184
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,560
Please tell him to call me once he comes back to his office.

185
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,920
How many have you checked so far?

186
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,280
I have only two left. Director Seok Joon Soo and...

187
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,590
Director Gwak Seung Jin who is in China for a business trip.

188
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,830
I checked everyone except those two.

189
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,910
Director Gwak, are you going to China now?

190
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,950
Yes, I'm heading to the airport now.

191
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,120
I have a board meeting to attend right now.

192
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,700
But I forgot to wear my badge.

193
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,510
Can I borrow yours today?

194
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,560
Of course. You should avoid getting scolded by the chairman.

195
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,260
- Here you go.
 - Yes.

196
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,930
Thank you.

197
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,330
I'll give it back to you once you get back from China.

198
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,600
What should I do?

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,860
He's coming back from China tomorrow.

200
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Excuse me, Sir.

201
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,670
Is everything all right with you?

202
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,330
Why do you care?

203
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,130
You look pale, that's why. I was just worried.

204
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,600
Thank you for your cooperation.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,930
(Yongwangnim Nakji)

206
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,730
(Nakji character contest, Winner gets 50 nakjis for free)

207
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,700
A character drawing contest for nakji?

208
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,300
Gosh, riding a night train will be very romantic.

209
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,130
We can have boiled eggs with beer.

210
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,100
We're going to a funeral. Don't expect any romance.

211
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,760
We're going to Suncheon. We'll be back tomorrow.

212
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,340
Mi's on a business trip in Busan. Will you be okay home alone?

213
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,130
I'm not a kid any more. Have a safe trip.

214
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,700
When you were home alone last time,

215
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,700
a ghost came out from the ceiling like this. Ouch.

216
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,330
Don't scare her.

217
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,100
We'll see you tomorrow. Stay safe.

218
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,120
I saw the ghost from the ceiling.

219
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,890
- Stop. You're worse than a ghost.
 - Okay, okay.

220
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,500
- She'll be home alone.
 - Have a safe trip.

221
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,960
What was that?

222
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,100
Is it a ghost?

223
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,260
I'm scared.

224
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,400
It hurts.

225
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,730
Where is it?

226
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,900
Come on.

227
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,430
Shim? What's going on? What happened?

228
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,330
Open the door, Shim.

229
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,860
Shim!

230
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,330
Hey, Dan Tae.

231
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,060
I'm alive.

232
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,170
What's going on? Are you all right?

233
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,600
The power went off suddenly.

234
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,100
Can you fix it for me?

235
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,410
- The power went off?
 - Hurry up.

236
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,530
Really?

237
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,030
Where is the fuse box?

238
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,460
My parents went to a funeral. They're coming home tomorrow.

239
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,220
And my sister is on a business trip. She's not here.

240
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,900
I was home alone, and I really didn't know what to do.

241
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,040
Do you not know how to fix it?

242
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,700
Don't you know how to get the power back on?

243
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,000
It has nothing to do with my major, so I don't really know.

244
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,660
Gosh, but what are you going to do?

245
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,230
You must be scared to be home alone.

246
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,830
That's why I need to fix this.

247
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
But my dad knows how to handle electricity...

248
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,960
even though he didn't major in sciences.

249
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,470
My school was coeducational.

250
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,230
Oh, okay.

251
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,760
Let me look it up on the internet.

252
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,430
I know that I need to find the fuse box, though.

253
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,930
Where is that?

254
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,550
Goodness.

255
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,300
You scared me. I almost had a heart attack.

256
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,030
You scared me more.

257
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,230
- Ouch.
 - Are you okay?

258
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,270
You should've checked properly.

259
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,100
We almost went to the wrong funeral.

260
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,330
Take your shoes.

261
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,400
No, no. Don't go that way.

262
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,430
I can't believe this.

263
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,130
Why is it so dark in here?

264
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,960
Shim.

265
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,700
Are you already in bed?

266
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,360
The power went off.

267
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,860
Let me check the fuse box. Wait here.

268
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,210
Why did you come back so early?

269
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,040
You don't want to know. I'm still so angry.

270
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,050
He didn't pass away. There was no funeral.

271
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,330
The 97 year old man who almost passed away is doing well now.

272
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,550
He is fine. He recognises all of his family.

273
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,750
I was told that he won't make it tonight.

274
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,630
I'm pretty sure they didn't literally mean that.

275
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,830
The fuse box was off. Why didn't you do anything about it?

276
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,300
It... It went off just now.

277
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,430
I'm going back to my room.

278
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,030
Gosh, what is this? We went for nothing.

279
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,960
It only made me hungry.

280
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,330
It's me. It's me.

281
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,720
Let me tell you why they're back so early.

282
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,100
I heard them talk about what happened.

283
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,130
Right.

284
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,260
But why did I hide? I can't even leave now.

285
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,430
You're right.

286
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,430
But they could've asked me what we were up to in the darkness.

287
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,760
You missed the timing to leave. You can't leave now. No.

288
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,550
Then what should I do?

289
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,260
Please wait a little.

290
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,400
They will go to bed soon.

291
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,100
It won't take long, right?

292
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,860
They'll soon go to bed. Get some rest.

293
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,330
What's wrong?

294
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,860
I smell pork. Don't you?

295
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,800
Pork?

296
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,100
Are they really...

297
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,400
Are you hungry?

298
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,880
I can never hate you.

299
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,730
You said you were hungry.

300
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,300
You're so cute.

301
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,260
Cheers.

302
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,800
Cheers.

303
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,500
What are you doing at this hour?

304
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,600
What's wrong? We're just hungry.

305
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,360
I guess you're going to take your time.

306
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,200
We don't need to hurry. We'll slowly eat a lot.

307
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,330
Join us, Shim. You should eat, too.

308
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,360
Shim, what are you doing?

309
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,590
Have a seat. The samgyeopsal is so good.

310
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,550
Eat it with the lettuce. We just harvested them from the garden.

311
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,750
It tastes so fresh.

312
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,500
Samgyeopsal tastes best when you fry it in its own oil.

313
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,580
Open up.

314
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,110
How is it? It's good, right?

315
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,460
Yes, it's so delicious.

316
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,530
Hey.

317
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,630
Where are you going?

318
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,240
I was going to eat it in private.

319
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,130
Why would you eat that in private?

320
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,360
My daughter is quite unique.

321
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,060
Where are you?

322
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,530
Shim.

323
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,600
The smell of samgyeopsal is killing me. I can't stand it.

324
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,530
Eat this.

325
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,830
Is this all you brought?

326
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,530
Sorry?

327
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,930
You have two hands, don't you?

328
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,930
I'll be right back.

329
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,730
Hold on, Shim.

330
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,830
Put in a lot of meat, garlic and ssamjang paste.

331
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,260
And I want two layers of lettuce.

332
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,460
Got it.

333
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,800
Two layers of lettuce.

334
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,460
A lot of meat.

335
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,530
Garlic and...

336
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,130
Here we go.

337
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,430
- Why?
 - You never eat raw garlic.

338
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,970
I'm lacking energy these days.

339
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,700
She's right. Garlic is a good energy booster.

340
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,630
Shim, invite Dan Tae over.

341
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,760
We have plenty to share.

342
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,900
You should tell him to come and eat with us.

343
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,930
Yes, go bring him down.

344
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,770
No.

345
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,260
I think he's really busy these days.

346
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,060
I'll go eat quietly in private.

347
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,730
Hey.

348
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,530
What's with her?

349
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,130
I'm not sure.

350
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,830
She's acting strange.

351
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Why aren't you hiding?

352
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,630
I can't eat like this any more.

353
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,770
It's not like we did anything wrong.

354
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,100
I'm going to go out and eat confidently.

355
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,170
You can't. It's too late.

356
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,010
No. I'll go out there and explain what happened.

357
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,420
No. It'll make us look weird. It's too late.

358
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,510
We did nothing wrong. What's the problem?

359
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,740
I'm going.

360
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,830
You can't!

361
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,020
- You can't.
 - Shim.

362
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,030
- No.
 - I'm going.

363
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,430
- No.
 - Come out and eat.

364
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,530
No.

365
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,730
Your sister will yell at you if you make her clothes smell.

366
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,800
Where did she go?

367
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,260
Honey!

368
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,860
He passed away just now.

369
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,480
- Are you serious?
 - Of course.

370
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,900
He left peacefully.

371
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,560
What are we going to do?

372
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,030
It's too late for us to drive down now.

373
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,100
Did she go to the wash room?

374
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,200
We missed the last train already.

375
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,000
Are they for me?

376
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,530
Yes.

377
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,730
They'll find out if I keep going back and forth.

378
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,200
I'll stay outside.

379
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,480
Please hang in there even if it's hard.

380
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,560
Okay.

381
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,590
(Please make a lot of money.)

382
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,360
Please make a lot of money.

383
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,330
(Stupid)

384
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,530
You're so stupid.

385
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,130
(Crook)

386
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,330
You're a conman.

387
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,660
(Should I tell him I like him?)

388
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,730
Should I tell him I like him?

389
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm sorry. It must've been hard to stay in here.

390
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,000
Can I go out now?

391
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,430
Yes. They went to bed since they have to leave early in the morning.

392
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,060
Thank you for the samgyeopsal.

393
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,900
I'm sorry.

394
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,260
Don't be. Sleep well.

395
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,500
I'll get going. Good night.

396
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,630
Okay.

397
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,830
It's the 3pm flight.

398
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
I'll ask you one more time.

399
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,200
Should I go...

400
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,630
or not?

401
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,430
You should go, Shim.

402
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,810
Fancy running into you here.

403
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,100
Where are you going at this hour?

404
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,530
I'm going to work.

405
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,130
Right, it's time to go to work.

406
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,500
How's working at the office?

407
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
It's all right.

408
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,500
Why are you following me?

409
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,130
I'm not. I'm just going my way.

410
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,200
Dan Tae, do you like mulnaengmyeon or bibimnaengmyeon?

411
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,460
Mulnaengmyeon.

412
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Okay.

413
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,000
I'll have it ready for you when you get home.

414
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,030
I think I'll be late today.

415
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,960
Why didn't you tell me that you'd be late?

416
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,630
You just asked me now.

417
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,560
If you finish early by chance, let me know.

418
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,760
Okay.

419
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,100
Go earn a lot of money.

420
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,200
Director Gwak who is currently on a business trip in China...

421
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,240
and Director Seok who is off site haven't been confirmed yet.

422
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,120
When is Mr Gwak coming back?

423
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,560
He's scheduled to come to the office this afternoon.

424
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
We'll...

425
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,260
find out who lost the badge today.

426
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,530
Yes. I think so.

427
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,630
We'll see Joon Soo later.

428
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,430
It must be Mr Gwak who lost it.

429
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,230
Chairman,

430
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,410
do you plan on scolding him?

431
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,200
Go and check on it right away.

432
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,530
Yes, Ma'am.

433
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,380
Are you here?

434
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,500
I have to leave right now for an environmental union seminar.

435
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,230
What? You're busy again?

436
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,540
Why is it so hard to have lunch with you?

437
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,330
I'm sorry. It'll get better after today.

438
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,820
Why don't you ever wear that expensive jacket?

439
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,350
It's all wrinkly now.

440
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,330
You never wear anything I buy for you.

441
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,800
I've been saving it for important occasions.

442
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,460
You've become sly lately.

443
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,130
She's here.

444
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,830
Come on in.

445
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,960
Are you meeting someone here?

446
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,360
Hello.

447
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,260
Lawyer Gong.

448
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,260
I wanted the three of us to get lunch.

449
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,640
Sorry, I have to go for a seminar at the hotel.

450
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,000
It's quite all right.

451
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,110
It's just the two of us again.

452
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,600
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

453
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
Joon Soo, are you taking the company car?

454
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,860
No, I'll drive over.

455
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,700
I see.

456
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,580
Lawyer Gong, please take good care of her.

457
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,030
She'll soon be the most powerful person in the company.

458
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,280
Yes, Sir.

459
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,730
Did you follow me here to talk nonsense?

460
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,680
Are you leaving now? I have to go.

461
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,800
Let's go.

462
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,030
(Uncle Tae Cheol)

463
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,330
Hey, Uncle Tae Cheol.

464
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,760
No, not yet.

465
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,730
That document?

466
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,900
It's probably in my office.

467
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,930
I'll get it for you before I go.

468
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,630
Okay.

469
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,200
Yes, Uncle Tae Cheol.

470
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,560
Oh, you found it?

471
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,970
It's okay.

472
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,860
All right.

473
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,260
If we count Director Seok out, Director Gwak is the only one left.

474
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,100
Age and home town...

475
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,000
He doesn't seem like he has any relations to my father.

476
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,330
Executive Director Yeom borrowed your badge?

477
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,350
Yes. He came to me two days ago before I left for my business trip,

478
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,130
so I lent it to him.

479
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,710
You never got it back from him?

480
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,760
No.

481
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,100
Hello.

482
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,300
Executive Director Yeom.

483
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,060
Did you borrow this badge from Director Gwak?

484
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,830
Thank you for lending it to me.

485
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,630
I left my badge at home on the day I had a meeting.

486
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't tell the chairman that I borrowed the badge...

487
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,100
before going into a meeting.

488
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,970
Okay?

489
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,330
That document?

490
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,530
It's probably in my office.

491
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,800
I'll get it for you before I go.

492
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,130
Okay. Thank you so much.

493
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,430
I already took care of the surveillance cameras.

494
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,970
My bag!

495
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,560
Why did I leave my window open?

496
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,130
The drawings that you gave me...

497
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,200
really cheered me up.

498
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,130
I want you to continue drawing.

499
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,970
I'm your fan.

500
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,030
Even the most famous artist must have started with a single fan.

501
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,530
(Gong Shim)

502
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,970
(Director Seok)

503
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,860
Hello?

504
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,430
Yes, Director.

505
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,360
Yes, I'm at home.

506
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,470
What?

507
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,330
What will you do? You lost all the documents?

508
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,800
Right now?

509
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,930
Yes, I understand.

510
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,630
I'll be right there.

511
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,030
Director!

512
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm so sorry I called you suddenly.

513
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,200
What happened? Why didn't you call your colleagues?

514
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,610
Actually, I'm trying to become independent from the company.

515
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,830
Become independent?

516
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,430
Why?

517
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,600
I don't like hearing that I got everything from my family.

518
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,700
I was preparing my own business without telling my family.

519
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,970
I'm scheduled to do a presentation for my potential investors,

520
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,470
but I lost all my documents along with the bag.

521
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,230
I've delayed the meeting for two hours for now.

522
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,830
Two hours? What should I do?

523
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,980
I told the office that I have a seminar to attend...

524
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,830
to go to this meeting.

525
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,500
I can't call my colleagues since I'm doing this in secret.

526
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,330
All I could think of was you.

527
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,730
Can you help me?

528
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,240
I don't think now's the time to talk about that.

529
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,700
What should I do? Just tell me what to do.

530
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,360
I have all the sources on my cloud.

531
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,180
I need you to fix the presentation material.

532
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,440
Okay.

533
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
- Let's start.
 - Okay.

534
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,830
(Developing private-label products,)

535
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,530
(currently in discussion with franchise convenience stores)

536
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,430
(Joon Soo's Great Series)

537
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,200
Here you go.

538
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,500
You saved me.

539
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,470
Thank you, Shim.

540
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,130
It was nothing.

541
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,230
I don't have time right now, so I'll call you later.

542
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,660
Okay. You should go.

543
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,360
Thank you so much.

544
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,700
That was hectic.

545
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,700
My nakji!

546
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,310
- Sir.
 - Yes?

547
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,780
The contest isn't closed yet, right?

548
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,210
The character contest?

549
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,930
You can put it on that table.

550
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,920
Okay.

551
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,730
(Nakji character contest)

552
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,860
Why are there so many?

553
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
(Gong Shim)

554
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,300
Do you know how many people applied?

555
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,060
I think it's about 100 people.

556
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,980
100 people?

557
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,400
A lot of students from arts and design seem to have applied.

558
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,700
I didn't mean it to get so huge.

559
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,470
I see.

560
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,930
- Bye.
 - Bye.

561
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,130
Even this isn't easy.

562
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,690
Lawyer Gong, I don't know what it is about you.

563
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,690
I always enjoy it when I eat with you,

564
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,980
and it's fun when I go shopping with you, too.

565
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,300
It's because you're nice to me.

566
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,430
It feels like I have a new friend. I'm having a great time.

567
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,970
I'm glad you think that way.

568
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,730
- There's the car.
 - Yes.

569
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,330
My goodness! What should we do?

570
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,060
My goodness.

571
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,060
Gosh. My goodness.

572
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,780
Ouch, that hurts. Oh, my back.

573
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,560
Try to get up.

574
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,130
- Gosh.
 - Ouch.

575
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,720
Including my wrist and my back, I'm in a lot of pain.

576
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,330
I'll have to go to the hospital.

577
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,180
Give me 5000 dollars right now for the doctor.

578
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,800
Here.

579
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,470
Right now I don't...

580
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,900
Hold on, Ma'am.

581
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,100
- Don't give him anything.
 - What?

582
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,130
Who are you?

583
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,860
First of all, the black box on the car captured...

584
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,100
you jumping into the car.

585
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,530
I'm sure the car over there also captured it.

586
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,100
It'll be obvious when we look at the clips.

587
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,060
Who are you?

588
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,000
Should I call the police?

589
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,630
Go ahead.

590
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,260
(Lawyer Gong Mi)

591
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,990
A lawyer?

592
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,130
We were driving at a low speed when you purposefully...

593
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,760
jumped in to hit it with your wrist.

594
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,950
According to the constitution's Act 39 Article 347,

595
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,830
you'll either get 10 years in prison or a penalty under 20,000 dollars.

596
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,830
On top of that, you could get up to 15 years if you're an ex-convict.

597
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,760
What would you like to do? Do you want to go to the station?

598
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,630
I'm okay.

599
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,200
What? What's with him?

600
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,530
Is he a habitual offender?

601
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,230
How can this happen?

602
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,600
You must have been surprised.

603
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,050
My goodness, you're such a doll.

604
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,350
I knew it when she helped Joon Soo before.

605
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,650
What a sweetheart.

606
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,520
Mother, do you like her?

607
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,500
Of course.

608
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,900
She's perfect.

609
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,060
Lawyer Gong, do you have a boyfriend?

610
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,730
I'm sorry?

611
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,480
No, not yet.

612
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,120
What's wrong with all the men in this world?

613
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,600
How can someone like her not have a boyfriend?

614
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:18,000
What do you think about my son, Joon Soo?

615
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Sorry?

616
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,260
You two should date.

617
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,390
Yes. They're perfect for each other.

618
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,960
You two would look great together.

619
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,330
What do you think?

620
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,760
I'll help you out.

621
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,730
Well, I...

622
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,060
I don't think it's up to me.

623
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,820
That must mean that you're interested...

624
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,530
as long as Joon Soo agrees.

625
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,760
Right?

626
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,970
My goodness.

627
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,690
My daughter-in-law and my great-daughter-in-law!

628
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,700
You two will get along so well.

629
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,600
How adorable.

630
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,660
(Gong Shim)

631
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,730
Yes, this is Shim.

632
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,280
Did you get home all right?

633
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,400
Yes, Sir.

634
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,670
How did the presentation go?

635
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,700
Shim.

636
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,830
The investors agreed to invest in my idea.

637
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Really?

638
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,280
I'm so glad to hear that.

639
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,300
Congratulations.

640
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,710
It's all thanks to you.

641
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,940
Thank you so much.

642
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,500
I didn't do much.

643
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,500
I'm hesitant to ask,

644
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,900
but have you found a job?

645
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,130
Not yet. I'm just doing part-time work for now.

646
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,700
I want to help you.

647
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,230
I'd be happy to get your mental support.

648
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,130
If I introduced you to a job,

649
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,880
would that hurt your pride?

650
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,560
I want to be like you and try to find something...

651
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,830
on my own.

652
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,660
I understand.

653
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,530
I'll look forward to it.

654
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,230
Okay. Bye.

655
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,200
Dan Tae,

656
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,730
you should go now.

657
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,700
Aren't you tired?

658
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,360
I'm sure you're more tired than I am.

659
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,130
I get to do my own work aside from the visiting hours. It's okay.

660
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,800
Aunt Ji Won.

661
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,130
He'll wake up, right?

662
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,960
Even if it's for a moment, he'll wake up, right?

663
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,100
I still have a lot to talk to him about.

664
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,460
Of course.

665
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,060
Welcome.

666
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,360
You're here.

667
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,400
You look really tired.

668
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,200
Goo Nam.

669
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,550
I think I'll be less tired if I have a certain something.

670
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,000
Can you guess what it is?

671
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm really sorry.

672
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,330
We're out of King Lunchboxes.

673
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,460
Goo Nam.

674
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,430
Didn't I tell you to save one for me?

675
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,610
I'm sorry. People knew that I was hiding it and asked for it.

676
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,330
I had no choice.

677
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,600
I'm disappointed in you.

678
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,700
How can you give them my King Lunchbox?

679
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,620
You're not betraying me, are you?

680
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,400
No way.

681
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,200
Gosh.

682
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,730
You're here.

683
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,000
Were you waiting here?

684
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,000
It's nice and cool up here.

685
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,200
You asked Goo Nam for the King Lunchbox, right?

686
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,130
I bought it before you.

687
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,700
Sit down.

688
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,300
I thought I had a new enemy,

689
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,530
but it was you.

690
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,980
Enjoy.

691
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,400
I want to try it, too.

692
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:52,930
Here.

693
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,200
Thank you for the food.

694
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,330
Thank you.

695
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,900
It's good.

696
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,930
Since when did you like King Lunchboxes?

697
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,120
Ever since they released it.

698
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,100
What else do you like?

699
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,760
Banana milk, sausages, and iced...

700
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,700
But...

701
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,600
why are you asking me that?

702
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,460
I'm just curious, that's all.

703
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,230
You're not wearing flip-flops today.

704
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,740
You seem to wear that white dress shirt a lot.

705
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,460
Do you wear it because you know girls like it?

706
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,130
Not at all.

707
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,570
Do you call your dad often?

708
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,930
How is your aunt?

709
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,860
Come to think of it, I haven't talked to your aunt in a while.

710
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,230
Do you take after your mum or your dad?

711
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,260
You didn't look like your dad when I saw him last time.

712
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,300
Am I wrong?

713
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,660
I guess you look like him in some ways.

714
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,600
Your mum must be really beautiful.

715
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,560
Shim, I'm sorry. I'm going to head in.

716
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,130
You didn't even finish it.

717
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,330
Are you feeling sick?

718
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,500
I'm just tired.

719
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,030
(Should I tell him I like him?)

720
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:08,630
Do you take after your mum or your dad?

721
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,530
Why am I living as Ahn Dan Tae?

722
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,830
If I'm not Ahn Dan Tae, then why am I Dan Tae?

723
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,600
What's wrong, Dad? Dad!

724
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,500
Dad!

725
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,760
Who am I?

726
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,130
No one applied for a new badge as of yet.

727
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,260
Other than one person, everyone else proved that they have it.

728
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,900
Who is that one person?

729
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,500
It's Director Seok Joon Soo.

730
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,780
Joon Soo?

731
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,050
Yes. We didn't get to check with him yesterday...

732
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,760
because he had gone to a seminar.

733
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,560
When I called him, he said he would come here himself.

734
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,860
There you are.

735
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,560
Joon Soo,

736
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,760
where is your badge? Do you have it?

737
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,730
Well...

738
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm sorry.

739
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,100
I lost it when I went to a seminar at a hotel.

740
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,060
You lost it at a seminar?

741
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,430
I took a jacket my badge was on,

742
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,360
but it was stolen.

743
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,910
What?

744
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,030
It was stolen?

745
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,130
Your jacket got stolen?

746
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,960
Yes, along with my bag.

747
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,730
I think they wanted my wallet and my laptop.

748
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,200
But my jacket was with my bag,

749
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,730
so I ended up losing my badge with it.

750
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,500
It sounds like a huge bag. How did you lose it?

751
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,100
Did you try looking for it?

752
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,130
Yes.

753
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:05,960
A bag thief?

754
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,530
Did the person follow Joon Soo to get his bag?

755
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,200
He mentioned the seminar was at the Shindeahan Hotel.

756
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,230
Yes, this is Shindeahan Hotel.

757
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,860
There was a seminar there yesterday held by Star Group, right?

758
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,330
Is it possible to check your security footages?

759
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,730
We didn't have any seminars here yesterday from Star Group.

760
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,800
Then...

761
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,660
could you check if someone by the name Seok Joon Soo...

762
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,080
ever booked your seminar room?

763
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,330
Hold on one moment.

764
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,030
No, he didn't.

765
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
No?

766
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,810
Are you sure?

767
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,230
Yes, I'm sure.

768
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,560
All right. Thank you.

769
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,660
What's going on?

770
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,410
- Look at that.
 - Excuse me.

771
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,000
- Who is Gong Shim?
 - I feel jealous.

772
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,000
(First Prize Winner: Gong Shim)

773
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,230
Did I really win?

774
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,330
It can't be.

775
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,600
What should I do?

776
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,060
That Gong Shim is me.

777
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,300
I'm Gong Shim.

778
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,760
It's me. I'm Gong Shim.

779
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,760
I drew this picture. I did it.

780
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,600
Thank you. Thank you.

781
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,700
Welcome, Dan Tae.

782
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,130
I'm sorry if I surprised you with my visit.

783
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,030
No, that's okay.

784
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,700
I just have been really busy lately.

785
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,460
How was your seminar?

786
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,400
It was great.

787
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,280
Didn't you go through any trouble because of your lost bag?

788
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,960
Your laptop was in that bag.

789
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,530
How can you go to a seminar without any materials?

790
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,870
It was fine. I didn't need any materials.

791
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:36,130
I mostly listened to the presentations, so it was all good.

792
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,660
Wasn't it hosted by our company?

793
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,730
I somehow managed to skip my turn.

794
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,230
Dan Tae, I have to work on something right now.

795
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,110
Right, of course.

796
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:54,600
Then how about some beer after work?

797
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,910
Beer sounds good. Good idea.

798
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,130
All right. I'll see you at the pub in front of the building after work.

799
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,600
Why don't we go to your place instead?

800
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,630
I like it there.

801
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,230
Okay, sure.

802
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,600
I'll bring the beers and snacks.

803
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,700
Okay. I'll just go without buying anything then.

804
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,230
- All right. See you then.
 - Okay.

805
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,560
Why is he lying to me?

806
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,300
Did he really lose his badge or is that a lie, too?

807
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,330
(Khong Shim)

808
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,760
Yes, Shim.

809
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,960
Dan Tae. When are you coming home tonight?

810
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,530
I'm busy tonight.

811
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,880
Are you?

812
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,730
Are you coming home late? I've got something to show you.

813
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,730
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't see you tonight because of an appointment.

814
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,660
I see. That's too bad.

815
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,030
Aren't you going to ask what it's about though?

816
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm really sorry, Shim. I can't talk for long.

817
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,400
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll hang up now.

818
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,030
Wait.

819
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,700
Please call me even if you come home late, okay?

820
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,900
Okay, I will.

821
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,660
All right. Bye.

822
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,360
Why is he talking so seriously?

823
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,660
It's Dan Tae.

824
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,530
Dan Tae.

825
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,500
Ta-da.

826
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,130
(First Prize Winner: Gong Shim Prize: Voucher Worth 50 Nakjis)

827
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,830
What is this?

828
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,700
What happened?

829
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,330
A restaurant down the street held a character drawing contest.

830
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:24,100
So I participated.

831
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,100
And I won the first prize.

832
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,980
Really?

833
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,330
Wow. That's amazing.

834
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,130
That's really good to hear.

835
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,070
When did you participate? You didn't even tell me anything.

836
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,630
I really wanted to tell you,

837
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,080
but I was afraid I might fail.

838
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,730
So I was going to tell you if I win.

839
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,210
And I actually won!

840
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:48,560
Good for you.

841
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,260
Congratulations, Shim.

842
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,230
You're really amazing, Shim.

843
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,300
I'm really happy.

844
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,300
Never have I ever came in first place for anything...

845
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,860
my whole life.

846
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,430
I'm...

847
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,860
really happy.

848
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,130
Why are you about to cry when it's a good thing?

849
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,330
Don't cry, okay?

850
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,200
Thank you.

851
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,230
It's all thanks to you, Dan Tae.

852
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,560
What did I do?

853
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,600
It's all because you did well.

854
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,900
I gave it a try because you cheered me up and encouraged me.

855
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,700
When I think about it,

856
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,630
you're always the person who cheers me up.

857
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,830
You're the one who told me I'm pretty.

858
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,630
You're the one who saw my picture...

859
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,660
and cheered me up by telling me that you're my fan.

860
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,960
Every time I'm going through a hard time,

861
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:25,830
you're the one who always stood by me and kept me company.

862
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:29,930
It was always you, Dan Tae.

863
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,800
Shim.

864
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,560
I want to be that kind of person for you too, Dan Tae.

865
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,560
Shim. Just because...

866
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,560
Well, just because you're thankful,

867
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,730
it doesn't mean you have to...

868
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,930
You don't need to do this.

869
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,930
Remember what you said?

870
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:02,500
You said you're glad that you can see me anywhere at any time.

871
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,730
I feel the same way.

872
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,300
I keep thinking of you.

873
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,560
From early morning as I open my eyes...

874
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,900
to late at night before I fall asleep,

875
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,130
I keep thinking of you.

876
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,700
I often see you in my dreams, too.

877
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,130
I...

878
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,930
I like you, Dan Tae.

879
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,760
Shim.

880
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,460
I'm sorry.

881
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,930
I...

882
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,130
I...

883
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,130
I can't accept your heart, Shim.

884
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,000
So please don't like me any more. I'm really sorry.

885
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,930
What do you mean?

886
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,230
Then what about...

887
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,800
everything you told me last time?

888
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,810
What I said last time...

889
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:45,030
Back then,

890
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,200
things were very different.

891
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,260
But Shim, right now...

892
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:08,830
Dan Tae.
