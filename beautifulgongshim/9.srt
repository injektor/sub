321
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,740
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go fishing?</font>

322
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,940
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Seoul tomorrow. I'm sorry.</font>

323
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,470
<font color="yellow">I see. I didn't know that.</font>

324
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640

330
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,800

331
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,570
<font color="yellow">He's been missing for a month already.</font>

332
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,870
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm worried about him, too.</font>

333
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,740
<font color="yellow">Why was Joon Pyo crying in front of the photo studio?</font>

334
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,600
<font color="yellow">Is the photo studio in my dream...</font>

389
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,440

<font color="yellow">Dan Tae died. Why are you calling yourself Dan Tae?</font>

<font color="yellow">Dan Tae died.</font>

402
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,470
<font color="yellow">He died when he was five.</font>

403

404

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,670
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

407
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,040
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae died from drowning in that stream up there.</font>

408
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,540
<font color="yellow">I picked him up out of the water.</font>

409
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,170
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

410
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,570
<font color="yellow">His father was from the special forces.</font>

411
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,640
<font color="yellow">Including Dan Tae's aunt, the family of four lived here.</font>

412
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,970
<font color="yellow">How can I forget about them?</font>

413
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,740
<font color="yellow">After Dan Tae died, his mother lost her mind.</font>

414
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,900
<font color="yellow">Just four days after he died,</font>

415
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,000
<font color="yellow">she ran away in the middle of the night.</font>

416
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,570
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do?</font>

417
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,640
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

418
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

419
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,700
<font color="yellow">I died?</font>

420
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,900
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae died?</font>

421
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,500
<font color="yellow">Then who am I?</font>

422
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,570
<font color="yellow">What's that tree in Yangpyeong about?</font>

423
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,670
<font color="yellow">He called to say that they need to pull it out.</font>

424
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,970
<font color="yellow">It must be a man who flew from the Philippines...</font>

451
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,500

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,570
<font color="yellow">Mum, come on.</font>

470
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,240
<font color="yellow">You should be nice to him. It's his birthday.</font>

471
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,000
<font color="yellow">When I first saw you when I was young,</font>

472
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,440
<font color="yellow">I thought you were Shim's grandfather.</font>

473
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,210
<font color="yellow">- You punk. - Goo Nam.</font>

474
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
<font color="yellow">Why are you being mean, too?</font>

475
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
<font color="yellow">I'm just being honest. When I saw him with your mum,</font>

476
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,500
<font color="yellow">I thought he was her father.</font>

477
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,870
<font color="yellow">Goo Nam. Go home.</font>

478
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,400
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - Go home!</font>

479
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,040
<font color="yellow">Dad, happy birthday. Here.</font>

480
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,940
<font color="yellow">Cash is still the best, right?</font>

481
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,340
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Thank you, Mi!</font>

482
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,900
<font color="yellow">Dad, this honey is the best for heartburns.</font>

483
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,970
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday.</font>

484
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,270
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Shim.</font>

485
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,870
<font color="yellow">It's underwear.</font>

486
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,340
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Goo Nam.</font>

487
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,170
<font color="yellow">How many years has it been since you gave me underwear?</font>

488
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,240
<font color="yellow">I've been giving you the same gift for 10 years, too.</font>

489
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,340
<font color="yellow">Honey, happy birthday.</font>

490
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,740
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

491
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,340
<font color="yellow">Keep giving me the same gift for 50 more years.</font>

492
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,840
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

493
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's do a toast.</font>

494
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,270
<font color="yellow">For Dad's health.</font>

495
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,470
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers!</font>

496
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,000
<font color="yellow">(Pervert Lawyer)</font>

497
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
<font color="yellow">- Happy birthday. - Here.</font>

498
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,740
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Why are you still here?</font>

499
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,070
<font color="yellow">- Well? - I...</font>

500
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,540
<font color="yellow">I'll go in a while.</font>

501
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,040
<font color="yellow">- When will you leave? - What?</font>

502
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,040
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

503
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,640
<font color="yellow">We're calling from a hospital. Do you know a man named Ahn Dan Tae?</font>

504
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,140
<font color="yellow">- What? - He fainted on the street.</font>

505
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,100
<font color="yellow">He's been transferred to a hospital on an ambulance.</font>

506
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,400
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

507
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,340
<font color="yellow">How is he now?</font>

508
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,340
<font color="yellow">He's still unconscious. We need you to come right away.</font>

509
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,670
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right there.</font>

510
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,900
<font color="yellow">What happened? What's wrong with him? Is he okay?</font>

511
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,300
<font color="yellow">He's getting checked now, so please wait out here.</font>

512
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,270
<font color="yellow">Doctor, what happened?</font>

513
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,570
<font color="yellow">Why did he faint?</font>

514
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,340
<font color="yellow">I think he fainted due to shock.</font>

515
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,470
<font color="yellow">He seems to be under a lot of stress and exhaustion.</font>

516
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,800
<font color="yellow">Shock?</font>

517
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,600
<font color="yellow">If he rests well, he'll be fine.</font>

518
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

519
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,640
<font color="yellow">You have to fill out some forms. Please come with me.</font>

520
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

521
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,970
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday, Dan Tae!</font>

522
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,210
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

523
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,470
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for? Give it a test run.</font>

524
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is a really expensive model.</font>

525
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,540
<font color="yellow">Dad. Thank you so much.</font>

526
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,140
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

527
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,670
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful to you, too.</font>

528
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

529
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,340
<font color="yellow">Dad didn't kill Joon Pyo.</font>

530
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,210
<font color="yellow">He's not a murderer.</font>

531
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,240
<font color="yellow">That's Shim's bag.</font>

532
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,570
<font color="yellow">- Here you are. - Thank you.</font>

533
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,940
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae. Are you awake?</font>

534
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,940
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

535
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,870
<font color="yellow">Can you recognise me?</font>

536
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,100
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

537
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,340
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

538
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,710
<font color="yellow">He just visited me a few minutes ago.</font>

539
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,710
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

540
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,340
<font color="yellow">What did he say? Did he say you're okay?</font>

541
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,600
<font color="yellow">- Yes, he told me I'm all right. - That's good to hear.</font>

542
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you here anyway, Shim?</font>

543
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,670
<font color="yellow">Aren't you supposed to be in Jeju Island?</font>

544
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,600
<font color="yellow">That's not what we should be talking about.</font>

545
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,970
<font color="yellow">What happened? I couldn't reach you for a month.</font>

546
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,840
<font color="yellow">And suddenly, you're unconscious at a hospital.</font>

547
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,100
<font color="yellow">Something really bad happened to my father.</font>

548
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,370
<font color="yellow">But fortunately, it's all fine now.</font>

549
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,800
<font color="yellow">That's really fortunate.</font>

550
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,710
<font color="yellow">Shim, how was it in Jeju Island?</font>

551
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,100
<font color="yellow">In Jeju Island?</font>

552
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,740
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae, do you know a song called "Andante, Andante"?</font>

553
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,000
<font color="yellow">It sounds exactly like your name. Don't you know?</font>

554
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,940
<font color="yellow">I could hear the song everywhere, and I almost went crazy.</font>

555
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,600
<font color="yellow">Andante, andante</font>

556
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,600
<font color="yellow">Andante, andante</font>

557
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,800
<font color="yellow">It sounded like this.</font>

558
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,500
<font color="yellow">By the way, do you remember the seed you gave me on my birthday?</font>

559
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,870
<font color="yellow">Do you know when I realised that it was a sunflower seed?</font>

560
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,070
<font color="yellow">As soon as I saw the way it sprouted, I knew it was a sunflower.</font>

561
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,600
<font color="yellow">The sunflower bloomed completely.</font>

562
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,570
<font color="yellow">Did you receive the message I sent you?</font>

563
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,540
<font color="yellow">There is a haenyeo school in Jeju Island.</font>

564
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,740
<font color="yellow">I thought of becoming a haenyeo, but I gave up.</font>

565
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,300
<font color="yellow">It's because if I'm a secretary, people call me Secretary Gong.</font>

566
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,140
<font color="yellow">So people will call me Haenyeo Gong if I become a haenyeo.</font>

567
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:55,400
<font color="yellow">But Haenyeo Gong doesn't sound so great, does it?</font>

568
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,370
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're loud.</font>

569
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,270
<font color="yellow">Was I too loud? I'm sorry.</font>

570
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,500
<font color="yellow">I guess I talked too much in front of a patient.</font>

571
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,100
<font color="yellow">Your meal is here.</font>

572
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,770
<font color="yellow">I'll go and pick it up.</font>

573
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,800
<font color="yellow">Shim, I missed you.</font>

574
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,670
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - You're welcome.</font>

575
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,500
<font color="yellow">Here it is.</font>

576
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,100
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

577
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,870
<font color="yellow">It's meal time. Let's eat.</font>

578
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,070
<font color="yellow">There.</font>

579
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,400
<font color="yellow">Wow, it looks delicious.</font>

580
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,070
<font color="yellow">The kimchi is matured really well.</font>

581
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,540
<font color="yellow">There's jangjorim, too.</font>

582
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,870
<font color="yellow">This meal looks quite delicious.</font>

583
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,040
<font color="yellow">Here. Go ahead and eat.</font>

584
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,840
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

585
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,240
<font color="yellow">Because I'm unwell, I don't feel like eating anything.</font>

586
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,970
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? You should eat to recover.</font>

587
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,140
<font color="yellow">I really don't feel like eating right now.</font>

588
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,000
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet, Shim?</font>

589
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,340
<font color="yellow">If not, why don't you eat instead?</font>

590
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,370
<font color="yellow">I'm not a patient. I shouldn't eat a patient's meal.</font>

591
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,270
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter. You should eat, Shim.</font>

592
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,770
<font color="yellow">I didn't come to the hospital for a meal.</font>

593
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,970
<font color="yellow">I don't understand people who eat the meals for patients.</font>

594
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,500
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to eat?</font>

595
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,500
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not going to. I'm sorry.</font>

596
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,340
<font color="yellow">I'll return the tray then.</font>

597
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,840
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, what a waste. - You're really not eating?</font>

598
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,400
<font color="yellow">I told you already.</font>

599
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,640
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae. Why did you come out?</font>

600
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,100
<font color="yellow">I felt stuffy being indoors all day, so I wanted to take a walk outside.</font>

601
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,600
<font color="yellow">Can you walk? Do you need my help?</font>

602
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

603
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,570
<font color="yellow">Was it tasty?</font>

604
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,300
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - You ate my meal.</font>

605
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,800
<font color="yellow">No, I...</font>

606
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,970
<font color="yellow">You did eat my meal. My gosh, it smells.</font>

607
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,740
<font color="yellow">I only ate a little to see what it tastes like.</font>

608
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,340
<font color="yellow">A little?</font>

609
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,840
<font color="yellow">You didn't just taste it.</font>

610
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,440
<font color="yellow">You obviously finished the whole thing.</font>

611
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,470
<font color="yellow">Tell me. You ate it all, didn't you?</font>

612
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

613
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

614
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,600
<font color="yellow">That's okay. Well done.</font>

615
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,540
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you eat inside earlier when I told you to?</font>

616
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,040
<font color="yellow">How can I eat your meal in front of you when you're sick?</font>

617
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,070
<font color="yellow">You need to take a rest.</font>

618
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,170
<font color="yellow">I'll push it for you.</font>

619
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,500
<font color="yellow">Why does it smell so bad though?</font>

620
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,770
<font color="yellow">- That was amazing. - That was incredible.</font>

621
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,070
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - It's the best meal I've ever had.</font>

622
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,470
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's close the deal in the morning at the office.</font>

623
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,070
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Thank you.</font>

624
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,870
<font color="yellow">Mr Seok, you're a heavyweight. You're incredible.</font>

625
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,340
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

626
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,440
<font color="yellow">Thanks. See you tomorrow.</font>

627
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,170
<font color="yellow">- Good night. - Good night.</font>

628
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,970
<font color="yellow">Are you really all right, Director?</font>

629
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,000
<font color="yellow">Didn't you drink too much?</font>

630
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,170
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

631
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,340
<font color="yellow">They offered you so many drinks to make a better deal.</font>

632
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,070
<font color="yellow">You should go home, Mr Kim.</font>

633
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,670
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

634
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,400
<font color="yellow">Go home safely, Sir.</font>

635
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,940
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

636
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I fell asleep.</font>

637
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing up, Dan Tae?</font>

638
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,270
<font color="yellow">Do you need something? You could've just asked me without standing up.</font>

639
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,740
<font color="yellow">Shim, you look really tired.</font>

640
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,900
<font color="yellow">You should go home. It's too late.</font>

641
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,670
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine. Ask me if you need anything.</font>

642
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,070
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

643
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,670
<font color="yellow">- Go home, okay? - My gosh.</font>

644
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,200
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Really.</font>

645
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,370
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried, that's why. You should go.</font>

646
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,370
<font color="yellow">I'm totally fine.</font>

647
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,640
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

648
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,000
<font color="yellow">Director Seok.</font>

649
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,870
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae. What happened?</font>

650
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,700
<font color="yellow">I couldn't reach you, and now you're suddenly at a hospital.</font>

651
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry things turned out like this.</font>

652
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you for calling me, Shim.</font>

653
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,570
<font color="yellow">I couldn't come earlier because I had to dine with my customers.</font>

654
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,440
<font color="yellow">Take a seat, Director.</font>

655
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,140
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

656
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,570
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

657
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,140
<font color="yellow">- I'll do it. - Put it here.</font>

658
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,570
<font color="yellow">I'll give you something to drink.</font>

659
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,370
<font color="yellow">He's a bit drunk.</font>

660
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,440
<font color="yellow">No, not this. This is more refreshing.</font>

661
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,270
<font color="yellow">I hate you.</font>

662
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,000
<font color="yellow">Did you just say you hate me?</font>

663
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,100
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I worried about you?</font>

664
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,370
<font color="yellow">I call you so many times,</font>

665
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,140
<font color="yellow">but you didn't answer my calls.</font>

666
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,570
<font color="yellow">I won't let things go if you act like this again.</font>

667
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,470
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

668
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

669
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,370
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

670
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,600
<font color="yellow">Do you get it or not?</font>

671
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,500
<font color="yellow">I get it. I get it.</font>

672
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,270
<font color="yellow">I really like you, Dan Tae.</font>

673
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,770
<font color="yellow">Like this. I'll be keeping an eye on you like this.</font>

674
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,770
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you, Dan Tae.</font>

675
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,200
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

676
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Shim.</font>

677
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,600
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Director.</font>

678
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,370
<font color="yellow">Here, let's take him over there.</font>

679
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,870
<font color="yellow">- There's a bed for a kid. - Right.</font>

680
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,740
<font color="yellow">Lie down and rest.</font>

681
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,740
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

682
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,600
<font color="yellow">There are two patients in this room.</font>

683
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,140
<font color="yellow">I hate you more.</font>

684
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,370
<font color="yellow">He scared me.</font>

685
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,500
<font color="yellow">I guess Director is really drunk.</font>

686
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,800
<font color="yellow">I think so, too.</font>

687
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,540
<font color="yellow">But I thank him for coming all the way here.</font>

688
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,170
<font color="yellow">Shim, go home now. Will you?</font>

689
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,770
<font color="yellow">There are two patients in this room. How can I just leave?</font>

690
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,800
<font color="yellow">I can take care of him. So you can go home now.</font>

691
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,600
<font color="yellow">It's fine with me.</font>

692
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,840
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.</font>

693
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,600
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself, so you should go.</font>

694
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,800
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

695
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am. You should go back home.</font>

696
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,940
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

697
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,940
<font color="yellow">Bye. Sorry I can't see you out.</font>

698
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,340
<font color="yellow">Call me if anything happens.</font>

699
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,700
<font color="yellow">Like this. I'm going to be watching you like this.</font>

700
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,500
<font color="yellow">I hate you more.</font>

701
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,600
<font color="yellow">Why did I do that?</font>

702
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,700
<font color="yellow">Did you wake up?</font>

703
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,340
<font color="yellow">Dan... Dan Tae, how do you feel?</font>

704
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,040
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep okay last night?</font>

705
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,670
<font color="yellow">Wasn't the bed uncomfortable?</font>

706
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,970
<font color="yellow">That's for me to ask. Wasn't the bed uncomfortable?</font>

707
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,540
<font color="yellow">I got too drunk yesterday.</font>

708
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't make any mistakes, did I?</font>

709
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,540
<font color="yellow">- You don't remember a thing, right? - I don't.</font>

710
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,140
<font color="yellow">You didn't make any mistakes.</font>

711
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,370
<font color="yellow">It's good to know that you're better now.</font>

712
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,700
<font color="yellow">I have to go to work, so I should get going.</font>

713
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,170
<font color="yellow">Take good care of yourself.</font>

714
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,840
<font color="yellow">You came by even during your busy schedule.</font>

715
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,700
<font color="yellow">I hate you.</font>

716
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,140
<font color="yellow">Can you please forget about that?</font>

717
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,800
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you remember everything.</font>

718
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,340
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

719
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,740
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae, I'll see you later. Take good care of yourself.</font>

720
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,140
<font color="yellow">- I'll go now. - Okay.</font>

721
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,100
<font color="yellow">Director Seok.</font>

722
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,940
<font color="yellow">Are you coming from home?</font>

723
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

724
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,640
<font color="yellow">It's very kind of you.</font>

725
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,170
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

726
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,270
<font color="yellow">How is your hangover?</font>

727
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

728
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,640
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me. I got too drunk last night.</font>

729
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,540
<font color="yellow">- I apologise. - It's fine.</font>

730
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,340
<font color="yellow">You should go to work now.</font>

731
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

732
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,040
<font color="yellow">Has Dan Tae told you about what happened...</font>

733
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,770
<font color="yellow">to him lately?</font>

734
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,140
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know the specific details,</font>

735
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,340
<font color="yellow">but something must have happened at home.</font>

736
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,540
<font color="yellow">He said that everything is fine now and that we don't have to worry.</font>

737
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,270
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

738
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,040
<font color="yellow">Well, have a good day at work.</font>

739
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,800
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

740
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,040
<font color="yellow">Here we go. I think we are ready now.</font>

741
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,140
<font color="yellow">Let's leave the hospital.</font>

742
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,940
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

743
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,470
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

744
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you so much.</font>

745
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,500
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back one day.</font>

746
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,200
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it. Let's just go.</font>

747
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,500
<font color="yellow">You should eat healthy food, and rest well.</font>

748
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,440
<font color="yellow">Are you going to eat everything like you did the other day?</font>

749
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,770
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

750
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,100
<font color="yellow">You're being harsh on me for eating your food just once.</font>

751
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,640
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry and leave.</font>

752
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,300
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

753
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,040
<font color="yellow">You should go home first.</font>

754
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,840
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to go home?</font>

755
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,170
<font color="yellow">You should rest even if you got discharged.</font>

756
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,270
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stop by my office.</font>

757
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,070
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and go home.</font>

758
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,840
<font color="yellow">You haven't perfectly recovered yet, so don't be late.</font>

759
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,140
<font color="yellow">I'll be watching you. Got it?</font>

760
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,770
<font color="yellow">Got it.</font>

761
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,370
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

762
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,570
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

763
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,670
<font color="yellow">What happened to you?</font>

764
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,970
<font color="yellow">Where have you been for a month?</font>

765
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,670
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

766
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,400
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

767
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,940
<font color="yellow">You just left me a text saying not to worry about you.</font>

768
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,500
<font color="yellow">You didn't answer my calls or return my texts.</font>

769
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,570
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried I was?</font>

770
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,270
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae. Why did you do that?</font>

771
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,440
<font color="yellow">Aunt Ji Won.</font>

772
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,600
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

773
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,870
<font color="yellow">that I'm not Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

774
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,270
<font color="yellow">The real Ahn Dan Tae drowned when he was five years old.</font>

775
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,340
<font color="yellow">I've been to Bukseong-dong.</font>

776
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,940
<font color="yellow">I went to where Mum, Dad,</font>

777
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,770
<font color="yellow">you and the dead Dan Tae used to live.</font>

778
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,170
<font color="yellow">You used to live in a house next to a photo studio.</font>

779
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,400
<font color="yellow">And Dan Tae is buried...</font>

780
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,040
<font color="yellow">under that tree in Yangpyeong.</font>

781
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,500
<font color="yellow">Did Dad...</font>

782
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,240
<font color="yellow">kidnap me?</font>

783
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,070
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

784
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,900
<font color="yellow">He didn't. That's not what happened.</font>

785
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,700
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

786
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,070
<font color="yellow">Why am I living as Dan Tae?</font>

787
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,470
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

788
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,440
<font color="yellow">Why am I living as Dan Tae when I'm not him?</font>

789
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,740
<font color="yellow">My sister,</font>

790
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,640
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae's mum,</font>

791
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,570
<font color="yellow">went insane after witnessing...</font>

792
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,900
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae drown.</font>

793
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,100
<font color="yellow">She didn't move. She just sat there staring into the air.</font>

794
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,340
<font color="yellow">She didn't eat anything.</font>

795
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,600
<font color="yellow">And she didn't talk.</font>

796
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,300
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

797
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,140
<font color="yellow">Within three days...</font>

798
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,870
<font color="yellow">after Dan Tae's death,</font>

799
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,600
<font color="yellow">my sister tried to attempt suicide two times.</font>

800
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,500
<font color="yellow">She was out of her mind.</font>

801
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
<font color="yellow">But one day,</font>

802
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:28,900
<font color="yellow">Soo Yong...</font>

803
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,770
<font color="yellow">brought home a boy.</font>

804
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:54,870
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Dan Tae.</font>

805
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,700
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

806
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,440
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Dan Tae.</font>

807
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,140
<font color="yellow">My sister...</font>

808
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,740
<font color="yellow">believed that the boy who came in with Soo Yong was Dan Tae.</font>

809
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,270
<font color="yellow">She was so happy...</font>

810
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,270
<font color="yellow">and took a good care of you.</font>

811
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,400
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you eat so well.</font>

812
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,100
<font color="yellow">Just like that, she started raising you.</font>

813
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,240
<font color="yellow">A day passed,</font>

814
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,070
<font color="yellow">a month passed,</font>

815
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,000
<font color="yellow">a year passed and then, 10 years passed by.</font>

816
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,540
<font color="yellow">You didn't talk when you first came.</font>

817
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,270
<font color="yellow">But you started to talk and smile.</font>

818
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,240
<font color="yellow">You started to act normal again.</font>

819
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,900
<font color="yellow">Aunt Ji Won.</font>

820
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,870
<font color="yellow">Was it Dad who kidnapped me?</font>

821
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,100
<font color="yellow">No, Dan Tae.</font>

822
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,370
<font color="yellow">That can never be.</font>

823
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,570
<font color="yellow">A person showed up and asked Soo Yong...</font>

824
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,140
<font color="yellow">to take care of you for a day.</font>

825
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,440
<font color="yellow">That's why he brought you home.</font>

826
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,000
<font color="yellow">Soo Yong overheard that...</font>

827
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,200
<font color="yellow">the person was...</font>

828
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,740
<font color="yellow">trying to abandon or kill you.</font>

829
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,900
<font color="yellow">We thought something bad would...</font>

830
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,070
<font color="yellow">happen to you if you went back to him.</font>

831
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,600
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

832
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,040
<font color="yellow">we had to leave the house in the middle of the night.</font>

833
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,570
<font color="yellow">Who is the person that asked Dad to take care of me?</font>

834
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,170
<font color="yellow">I don't know who that is.</font>

835
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:31,240
<font color="yellow">Soo Yong never mentioned anything about it.</font>

836
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,600
<font color="yellow">This is the truth, Dan Tae.</font>

837
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,540
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

838
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,970
<font color="yellow">Recently, your father was...</font>

839
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,900
<font color="yellow">planning to tell you the truth.</font>

840
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,040
<font color="yellow">But I told him not to.</font>

841
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,670
<font color="yellow">I was afraid that...</font>

842
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,140
<font color="yellow">we'll become criminals and lose you.</font>

843
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,240
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

844
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dan Tae.</font>

845
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,770
<font color="yellow">Aunt Ji Won.</font>

846
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,570
<font color="yellow">You'll always be my aunt.</font>

847
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,040
<font color="yellow">You'll do that for me, right?</font>

848
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much...</font>

849
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,440
<font color="yellow">for raising me well like this.</font>

850
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,700
<font color="yellow">Aunt Ji Won.</font>

851
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,100
<font color="yellow">Help me so I can meet Dad.</font>

852
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,770
<font color="yellow">I want to see him.</font>

853
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,200
<font color="yellow">Okay, Dan Tae.</font>

854
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

855
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,870
<font color="yellow">Let's go back up.</font>

856
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,440
<font color="yellow">Here are the two boxes.</font>

857
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,300
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Bye.</font>

858
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,770
<font color="yellow">You're back safely from Jeju Island.</font>

859
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,440
<font color="yellow">Don't get sick.</font>

860
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,340
<font color="yellow">And don't make me worry about you. I hope you grow well.</font>

861
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,500
<font color="yellow">I told him to come home early, but he's not here yet.</font>

862
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,240
<font color="yellow">My goodness, he really doesn't listen to what I say.</font>

863
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,540
<font color="yellow">I'm done.</font>

864
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:35,670
<font color="yellow">I told you to come home early, didn't I?</font>

865
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,370
<font color="yellow">I left the meal here since it's too late.</font>

866
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:50,140
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to take your medication.</font>
