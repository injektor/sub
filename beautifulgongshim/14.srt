3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,100
<font color="yellow">You're sitting in the passenger seat, so you should do your part.</font>

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,940
<font color="yellow">Play some music or talk to me.</font>

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

8
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,900
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

9
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,000
<font color="yellow">By the way, your singing was impressive.</font>

10
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,770
<font color="yellow">I will call you a flower</font>

11
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,900
<font color="yellow">You should go and sing trot songs for the elders.</font>

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,570
<font color="yellow">What about your dancing?</font>

13
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,570
<font color="yellow">You danced...</font>

14
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,840
<font color="yellow">like this.</font>

15
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,640
<font color="yellow">You were like a leader of a women's association.</font>

16
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,800
<font color="yellow">- Stop teasing me.
-  What did I do?</font>

17
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,900
<font color="yellow">We're home.</font>

18
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,340
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the ride.</font>

19
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,670
<font color="yellow">Thank you, too.</font>

22
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,770

<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

26
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,200
<font color="yellow">I came over thinking you'd be home since it's early in the morning.</font>

27
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,000
<font color="yellow">I was out of town.</font>

28
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,300
<font color="yellow">Please come in.</font>

29
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,140
<font color="yellow">You've been here before, so you know my place is not spacious, right?</font>

30
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,570
<font color="yellow">Please make yourself comfortable.</font>

31
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,070
<font color="yellow">- You can sit here.
-  Okay.</font>

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,300
<font color="yellow">Right. Hold on.</font>

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
<font color="yellow">I should give you something to drink.</font>

34
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,370
<font color="yellow">I don't have any drinks.</font>

36
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,940
<font color="yellow">Let me go to the store and buy something quickly.</font>

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,900
<font color="yellow">- It won't take long.
-  It's okay. Don't worry.</font>

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,140
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

39
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,270

45
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,200
<font color="yellow">It's the same memorial park.</font>

46
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,270
<font color="yellow">This is strange.</font>

47
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,570
<font color="yellow">Your drinks are here.</font>

48
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,070
<font color="yellow">In summer, it gets really hot here because it's a rooftop house.</font>

49
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,500

<font color="yellow">Oh, that.</font>

53
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,970
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's appropriate to ask you this,</font>

54
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,300
<font color="yellow">but why aren't you living with your family?</font>

55
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,500
<font color="yellow">My mother passed away when I was in high school.</font>

56
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,000

58
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,970

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,640

64
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,170
<font color="yellow">Is something going on?</font>

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
<font color="yellow">No, nothing's going on. I'm fine.</font>

66
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,300
<font color="yellow">I guess you're going through a hard time with your personal business.</font>

67

<font color="yellow">Yes, I guess.</font>

68

71

<font color="yellow">I'll help you. You can call me even for small errands.</font>

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,240
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

73
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,670
<font color="yellow">I wasn't just saying it. I mean it.</font>

74
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,970
<font color="yellow">Since we're talking about work, I'm curious to know.</font>

75
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,670
<font color="yellow">How are things going...</font>

76
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,640
<font color="yellow">with finding Joon Pyo?</font>

77
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,570
<font color="yellow">You said whoever lost the executive's badge was going to be...</font>

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,840
<font color="yellow">Joon Pyo's kidnapper, right?</font>

79
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

80
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,670
<font color="yellow">The person who took your bag is the suspect.</font>

81
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,070
<font color="yellow">Who do you think it is?</font>

82
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,070
<font color="yellow">You must have...</font>

83
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,140
<font color="yellow">someone in mind.</font>

84
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

85

<font color="yellow">I don't have any yet.</font>

86
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,470
<font color="yellow">Then by any chance,</font>

87
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,000
<font color="yellow">do you think the spam message is...</font>

88
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,500
<font color="yellow">related to finding the suspect, too?</font>

89
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340

90
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,900
<font color="yellow">just curious.</font>

92
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,540
<font color="yellow">It was only the executives that received the spam text message.</font>

93
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,370
<font color="yellow">And the badge is also only for the executives.</font>

94
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,170
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

95
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,070
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

96
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,370
<font color="yellow">I guess you didn't get the spam message...</font>

97
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,970
<font color="yellow">since you're not an executive of our company.</font>

98
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,670
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

99
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,440
<font color="yellow">Since I'm not an executive,</font>

100
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,340
<font color="yellow">I didn't get the spam text message.</font>

101
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,340
<font color="yellow">So I don't really know what it's about.</font>

102
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,570
<font color="yellow">Well, then I guess that text message has nothing to do with...</font>

103
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,670
<font color="yellow">finding Joon Pyo.</font>

104
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,070
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

105
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

106
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,040
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

107
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,410
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
-  I'll clean it.</font>

108
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll take care of it.</font>

109
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,670
<font color="yellow">You should go and wash your hands.</font>

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,300
<font color="yellow">- Sorry.
-  It's okay.</font>

111
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,070
<font color="yellow">All I need is a genetic testing...</font>

112
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,800
<font color="yellow">to see whether Dan Tae is Joon Pyo or not.</font>

113
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,500
<font color="yellow">You can use this towel.</font>

114
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

115
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,640
<font color="yellow">Who wrote this note?</font>

116
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,140
<font color="yellow">Someone told me to give you this.</font>

117
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,270
<font color="yellow">"Direct dealing has been cancelled."</font>

118

<font color="yellow">"Leave the scene immediately."</font>

119
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,410
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

120
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,270
<font color="yellow">the dealer told you to escape because he thought...</font>

121
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,540
<font color="yellow">the police were on him?</font>

122
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,700
<font color="yellow">What if your friend from the army is scheming everything...</font>

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,410
<font color="yellow">just to get money from us?</font>

124
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,770
<font color="yellow">Ahn Soo Yong?</font>

125
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,000
<font color="yellow">He could've made someone hide at the arboretum to take the video.</font>

126
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,370
<font color="yellow">He could've purposely got hit by you with everything planned in advance.</font>

127
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,270
<font color="yellow">Then he why would he tell you to leave without taking the money?</font>

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,370
<font color="yellow">Then who else could possibly write me this note?</font>

129
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,740
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This is driving me crazy.</font>

130
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,340
<font color="yellow">Tae Cheol.</font>

131
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,700
<font color="yellow">I'm so nervous.</font>

132
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,940
<font color="yellow">Do something. I'll pay as much as I need to fix this.</font>

133
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,170
<font color="yellow">Just wait a little more.</font>

134
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,410
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for Soo Yong anyway.</font>

135
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,740
<font color="yellow">We just need to make sure he keeps his mouth shut.</font>

136
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,470
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae is his son.</font>

137
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,270
<font color="yellow">He doesn't know anything.</font>

138
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,800
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even see his father.</font>

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
<font color="yellow">Do you think he would've stayed quiet if he knew everything?</font>

140
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,640
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see Ahn Dan Tae around, either.</font>

141
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,200
<font color="yellow">He makes me nervous.</font>

142
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,270
<font color="yellow">Soon, I'm going to take care of...</font>

143
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,200
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae, too.</font>

144
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

145
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,100
<font color="yellow">Since I'm not an executive,</font>

146
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't get the spam text message.</font>

147
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,600

<font color="yellow">Shim?</font>

149
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work?</font>

150
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,100
<font color="yellow">Yes. What's wrong?</font>

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,300
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

152
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,300
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because of all the painting I did at the sashimi place.</font>

153
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,340
<font color="yellow">When I woke up, my whole body was aching.</font>

154
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
<font color="yellow">Goodness, I need to go work, too.</font>

155
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,700
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take a day off?</font>

156
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,400
<font color="yellow">I get paid hourly.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm President Seok's biological mother.</font>

341

<font color="yellow">Does that help you understand?</font>

342

<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

343
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,500

<font color="yellow">My goodness, look how handsome he is.</font>

351
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,100
<font color="yellow">He seems like he has a great personality, too.</font>

352

356

<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

357
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,070
<font color="yellow">Well, she wanted me to take care of her personal documents.</font>

358
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,800
<font color="yellow">That's why I stopped by.</font>

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,200

360
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,070
<font color="yellow">So I think it'll take me some time.</font>

361
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,200
<font color="yellow">I'll be here often for a while.</font>

365
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,070
<font color="yellow">But I'm curious.</font>

366
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,240
<font color="yellow">Does she choose her secretary based on their looks?</font>

367
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,100

468
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

469
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,270
<font color="yellow">You were walking me over, weren't you?</font>

470
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,300
<font color="yellow">I didn't notice while I was talking to you.</font>

471
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be going.</font>

472
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,670
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

473
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,100
<font color="yellow">There we go.</font>

474
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,240
<font color="yellow">You should have checked before bringing that.</font>

475
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,370
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
-  Here he is.</font>

476
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,470
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

477
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,100
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me here so secretively?</font>

478
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,100
<font color="yellow">Secretary Ahn, we have a favour to ask.</font>

479
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,700
<font color="yellow">A favour? Go ahead.</font>

480
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,740
<font color="yellow">Can you put this back in Executive Director Yeom's office?</font>

481
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,970
<font color="yellow">This bag? Why?</font>

482
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,570
<font color="yellow">Our ladies here...</font>

483
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,300
<font color="yellow">emptied his garbage can without looking.</font>

484
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,600
<font color="yellow">When we were separating the recyclables, we found this.</font>

485
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,640
<font color="yellow">No matter how much we look at it, it looks so new.</font>

486
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,970
<font color="yellow">I don't think he meant to throw it out.</font>

487
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,340
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

488
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,340
<font color="yellow">We were going to put it back,</font>

489
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,500
<font color="yellow">but he'll be in soon, so we can't go in.</font>

490
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,700
<font color="yellow">So you're asking me to...</font>

491
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,070
<font color="yellow">take this bag back to Executive Director Yeom's office, right?</font>

492
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,440
<font color="yellow">- That's it.
-  Yes!</font>

493
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,000
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

494
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,640
<font color="yellow">That's not hard at all.</font>

495
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,070
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

496
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

497
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,470
<font color="yellow">Why does he have my bag?</font>

498
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,670
<font color="yellow">Do you know where this is from?</font>

499
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,570
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

500
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,940
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it look nice? It looks expensive.</font>

501
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

502
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,600
<font color="yellow">Did he look inside?</font>

503
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,740
<font color="yellow">Is he joking because he knows it's my bag?</font>

504
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,400
<font color="yellow">It's not mine.</font>

505
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,200
<font color="yellow">Who do you think...</font>

506
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,970
<font color="yellow">it belongs to?</font>

507
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,900
<font color="yellow">It's Executive Director Yeom's.</font>

508

<font color="yellow">My uncle?</font>

509
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

510
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,270
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit him at all.</font>

511
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,470
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

512
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

513
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,470
<font color="yellow">why do you have this?</font>

514
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,140
<font color="yellow">The cleaners were cleaning his office...</font>

515
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,670
<font color="yellow">and took it by mistake since it was in the garbage can.</font>

516
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,940
<font color="yellow">When they actually saw it, it didn't look like garbage to them.</font>

517
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,800
<font color="yellow">They asked me to return it, so I'm on my way over there.</font>

518
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,040
<font color="yellow">I'll take it there.</font>

519
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,270
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to him about something anyway.</font>

520
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,200
<font color="yellow">I'll take it to him.</font>

521
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,770
<font color="yellow">Will you? Thank you.</font>

522
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,970

<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

524
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,300

<font color="yellow">Speeding?</font>

532
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,100
<font color="yellow">You were speeding with the company car.</font>

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,740
<font color="yellow">It's the driver's responsibility.</font>

534

<font color="yellow">You have to pay in the given time.</font>

535

<font color="yellow">She's always making the rest of us pay.</font>

544

<font color="yellow">So that's her nickname.</font>

545
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,010

<font color="yellow">Dan Tae, forget the mate tea.</font>

557
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,400
<font color="yellow">I think this was when I went to the arboretum.</font>

<font color="yellow">How did it happen? Tell me from the beginning.</font>

594
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,940
<font color="yellow">We never intended on kidnapping him from the start.</font>

595
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,300

596
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,170
<font color="yellow">Since Joon Pyo's family is rich,</font>

00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,300
<font color="yellow">This is the truth.</font>

603
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,540
<font color="yellow">I was going to take the money,</font>

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,740
<font color="yellow">and then return him afterwards.</font>

605
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,140
<font color="yellow">There were three cases of traffic law violations...</font>

612
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,300
<font color="yellow">Do you know that people are calling you the grim reaper?</font>

613
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,600
<font color="yellow">Can I come join you in handing out the notices...</font>

614

624
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,510
<font color="yellow">What about Mum?</font>

625
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,170
<font color="yellow">Your mum?</font>

626
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,510
<font color="yellow">Her only crime is for keeping her mouth shut...</font>

627
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,240
<font color="yellow">although she saw me take Joon Pyo away.</font>

628
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,510
<font color="yellow">It was all me from the start.</font>

629
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,770
<font color="yellow">I'm her only sibling.</font>

630
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,940
<font color="yellow">She couldn't report me to the police.</font>

631
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,570
<font color="yellow">I'm going to protect my mum.</font>

632
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,100
<font color="yellow">I'll become a criminal if I have to.</font>

633
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,200
<font color="yellow">In order to protect her,</font>

634
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,510
<font color="yellow">I'll lie and deceive others.</font>

635
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,670
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

636
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,470
<font color="yellow">that doesn't mean that I forgive either of you.</font>

637
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,510
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

638
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,570
<font color="yellow">I'll protect my mum.</font>

639
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,970
<font color="yellow">Don't tell her...</font>

640
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,700
<font color="yellow">that I know.</font>

641
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,100
<font color="yellow">Open it.</font>

642
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,170
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

643
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
<font color="yellow">Did they used to belong to me?</font>

644
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

645
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,140
<font color="yellow">Take your time.</font>

646
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,370
<font color="yellow">See if you remember them.</font>

647
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

648
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,970
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

649
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,440
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you throw these out?</font>

650
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,140
<font color="yellow">How can I?</font>

651
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,570
<font color="yellow">I still have all of your clothes and shoes.</font>

652
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,740
<font color="yellow">I think we found each other again...</font>

653
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,070
<font color="yellow">because of your sincerity.</font>

654
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,770
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to...</font>

655
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,540
<font color="yellow">your great parents who raised you.</font>

656
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,200
<font color="yellow">Is your father still unconscious?</font>

657
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,800
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's still unconscious.</font>

658
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,100
<font color="yellow">I wish he'd wake up soon.</font>

659
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,840
<font color="yellow">I'd like to visit him at the hospital.</font>

660
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,670
<font color="yellow">Sure, Grandmother.</font>

661
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,670
<font color="yellow">Eat before you go.</font>

662
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,600
<font color="yellow">- I don't think I should.
-  It's okay.</font>

663
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,940
<font color="yellow">You should try and look around the house.</font>

664
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,770
<font color="yellow">Maybe you'll remember something.</font>

665
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,970
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

666
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

667
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,770
<font color="yellow">- Are you finished?
-  Yes.</font>

668
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,500
<font color="yellow">You should eat, Mother.</font>

669
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,540
<font color="yellow">- Ms Jo, Mother's ready to eat.
-  Yes, Ma'am.</font>

670
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,200
<font color="yellow">Secretary Ahn, you should join us.</font>

671
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

672
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,900
<font color="yellow">Come.</font>

673
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,970
<font color="yellow">I wonder if we'll have eggplants today.</font>

674
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,300
<font color="yellow">Why did Joon Soo get a speeding ticket?</font>

675
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,970
<font color="yellow">What's in Yangpyeong anyway?</font>

676

<font color="yellow">Yes. Hello.</font>

679
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,900
<font color="yellow">Mum, come have dinner.</font>

680
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,600
<font color="yellow">No, thank you. I snacked on too much at the community centre.</font>

681
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,370
<font color="yellow">Tell Ms Jo to bring me a cold sikhye to Joon Soo's room.</font>

682
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,500
<font color="yellow">I'll leave this in his room and take a break.</font>

683
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,400
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Mum.</font>

684
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,840
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

685
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,000
<font color="yellow">I'll take her the sikhye.</font>

686
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,140
<font color="yellow">Wait, hold on.</font>

687
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's good.</font>

688
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,540
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

689
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,400
<font color="yellow">One more.</font>

690
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,340

691
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,570
<font color="yellow">- I brought your sikhye, Ma'am.
-  You scared me.</font>

692
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,740
<font color="yellow">Why did you scare me like that?</font>

693
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you playing such a fun game in secret?</font>

694
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,970
<font color="yellow">They hate it when I play this game. They think it's inelegant.</font>

695

696
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,140

697
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,070
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to play with you?</font>

698
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,800
<font color="yellow">You have the cards, right?</font>

699

<font color="yellow">Gosh, you know how to play it?</font>

700
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,740
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Stay right here.</font>

701
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,100

779
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,970
<font color="yellow">I'm so thankful to you for today.</font>

780
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,840
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to see that exhibition.</font>

781
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,370
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

782
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,740
<font color="yellow">Director Seok. Is there something bothering you?</font>

783
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,940
<font color="yellow">Can you tell?</font>

784
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,170
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

785
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,600
<font color="yellow">I'm scared I might not be able to eat all this.</font>

786
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,300
<font color="yellow">I'm just kidding.</font>

787
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,770
<font color="yellow">Director Seok.</font>

788
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,400
<font color="yellow">It's not funny.</font>

789
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,270
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

790
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,270
<font color="yellow">All right, just eat.</font>

791
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,100
<font color="yellow">It's Dan Tae.</font>

792
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,770
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come and say hi to him?</font>

793
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,470
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Shim.</font>

794
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,270
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

795
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

796
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,670
<font color="yellow">Those exhibition tickets...</font>

797
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,670
<font color="yellow">weren't actually from me.</font>

798
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,240
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

799
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,870
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get to give you the tickets I got.</font>

800
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,440
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see it with you,</font>

801
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:06,840
<font color="yellow">so I lied.</font>

802
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,300
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying...</font>

803
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,470
<font color="yellow">I think they're from Dan Tae.</font>

804
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,000
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to him...</font>

805
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,570
<font color="yellow">and apologise.</font>

806
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

807
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,540
<font color="yellow">but could you let us talk in private?</font>

808
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,300
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

809
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,270
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

810
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I only have one beer.</font>

811
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,100
<font color="yellow">I'm coming back from the exhibition with Shim.</font>

812
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,300
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

813
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

814
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,170
<font color="yellow">We went to the exhibition...</font>

815
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,340
<font color="yellow">with the tickets from you.</font>

816
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,000
<font color="yellow">She thought...</font>

817
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,670
<font color="yellow">they were from me.</font>

818
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,640
<font color="yellow">I was mad...</font>

819
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
<font color="yellow">that you beat me to it.</font>

820
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,400
<font color="yellow">I was also scared of losing her.</font>

821
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,570
<font color="yellow">That's why I lied.</font>

822
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,700
<font color="yellow">No matter the reason,</font>

823
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,900
<font color="yellow">I know it was wrong.</font>

824
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,500
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

825
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,400
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed about what I've done,</font>

826
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,170
<font color="yellow">but I don't regret it.</font>

827
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,770
<font color="yellow">That's how strong my feelings are for Shim.</font>

828
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,670
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

829
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,040
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

830
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,300
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

831
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,700
<font color="yellow">went to the exhibition with Director Seok...</font>

832
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,240
<font color="yellow">with the tickets you gave me.</font>

833
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,470
<font color="yellow">I heard.</font>

834
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,070
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

835
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,400
<font color="yellow">Is that all you have to say to me?</font>

836
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,640
<font color="yellow">If you gave the tickets to me directly,</font>

837
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,000
<font color="yellow">there wouldn't have been any misunderstandings.</font>

838
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,540
<font color="yellow">You're the one who got me the pain relievers too, aren't you?</font>

839
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,670
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

840
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,940
<font color="yellow">If you're going to act like this, just leave me alone.</font>

841
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,340
<font color="yellow">I'll just handle my feelings on my own.</font>

842
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,240
<font color="yellow">Just because I smile a lot,</font>

843
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,070
<font color="yellow">it doesn't mean it's not hard for me.</font>

844
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

845
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I'm making it hard on you.</font>

846
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I can't say anything...</font>

847
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,570
<font color="yellow">to help you.</font>

848
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that...</font>

849
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,270
<font color="yellow">this is all I can do right now.</font>

850
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,570
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

851
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,300
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you three questions.</font>

852
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,000
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

853
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,170
<font color="yellow">suffering from a terminal illness? Will your life end shortly?</font>

854
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:28,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

855
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
<font color="yellow">You're not.</font>

856
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:32,970
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

857
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,840
<font color="yellow">did your first love come back or something?</font>

858
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,300
<font color="yellow">Is that why you're not accepting my feelings?</font>

859
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,540
<font color="yellow">Are you busy comparing me and her?</font>

860
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,900
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

861
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,100
<font color="yellow">That's not the case, either. Then...</font>

862
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,300
<font color="yellow">are you in debt?</font>

863
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,200
<font color="yellow">Are lone sharks after you or something?</font>

864
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,500
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about, Shim?</font>

865
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,770
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

866
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,100
<font color="yellow">It's because of last night.</font>

867
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,440
<font color="yellow">Although you apologised, you said you couldn't tell me why.</font>

868
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,940
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

869
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:14,870
<font color="yellow">don't know what's going on with you, Dan Tae.</font>

870
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,200
<font color="yellow">But if it's not any of the three things that I just mentioned,</font>

871
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,570
<font color="yellow">then I decided that I'll be okay.</font>

872
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,000
<font color="yellow">So I'll wait until you're done with whatever it is...</font>

873
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,900
<font color="yellow">that you're going through right now.</font>

874
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,640
<font color="yellow">But that doesn't mean I'm easy.</font>

875
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,370
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

876
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,070
<font color="yellow">I admit that even after getting rejected by you,</font>

877
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,100
<font color="yellow">I did kind of portray myself as an easy woman...</font>

878
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
<font color="yellow">by...</font>

879
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,440
<font color="yellow">telling you that I still like you straightforwardly.</font>

880
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,140
<font color="yellow">But I'm saying that I'm not, so keep that in mind.</font>

881
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,440
<font color="yellow">All right. I will.</font>

882
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,370
<font color="yellow">I'll get a job again, soon.</font>

883
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,170
<font color="yellow">Then new hairs will grow at the bald spot on my head.</font>

884
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,840
<font color="yellow">I'll become prettier, so don't feel relieved about anything.</font>

885
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,840
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't.</font>

886
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,170
<font color="yellow">Okay. You should go to work now.</font>

887
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,740
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

888
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,640
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

889
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,570
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

890
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,370
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

891
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:41,470
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

892
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

893
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,270
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae, you're here.</font>

894
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,470
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

895
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:19,800
<font color="yellow">When will he wake up?</font>

896
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,400
<font color="yellow">He'll wake up, right?</font>

897
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, he will.</font>

898
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,040
<font color="yellow">The doctor said there's hope.</font>

899
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, he'll wake up.</font>

900
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,800
<font color="yellow">By the way, I received a call from the arboretum...</font>

901
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,940
<font color="yellow">to pick up your father's luggage.</font>

902
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,570
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll go there.</font>

903
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

904
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,770
<font color="yellow">(Blue Sky Arboretum)</font>

905
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,000
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

906
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,240
<font color="yellow">Hello. How can I help you?</font>

907
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,140
<font color="yellow">I'm here to pick up the luggage which belongs to Mr Ahn Soo Yong.</font>

908
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,040
<font color="yellow">He worked here until recently.</font>

909
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,540
<font color="yellow">Please wait a moment. Our staff is on his way here with it.</font>

910
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,200
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Okay.</font>

911
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,670
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. By any chance,</font>

912
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,970
<font color="yellow">have you met this man recently...</font>

913
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,240
<font color="yellow">at this arboretum?</font>

914
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,900
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so.</font>

915
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,200
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen him before?
-  No, I haven't.</font>

916
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,600
<font color="yellow">Me neither.</font>

917
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,200
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

918
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,670
<font color="yellow">I see. Thank you.</font>

919
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,700
<font color="yellow">- There he is.
-  Here you go.</font>

920
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,640
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  You're welcome.</font>

921
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,070
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, I have a question.</font>

922
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,700
<font color="yellow">Sir, have you seen this man...</font>

923
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,740
<font color="yellow">at the arboretum recently?</font>

924
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's that young man.</font>

925
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,200
<font color="yellow">Do you know him?</font>

926
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,300
<font color="yellow">Have you seen him before?</font>

927
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,640
<font color="yellow">Of course. He asked me to deliver...</font>

928
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,600
<font color="yellow">a small note to a lady standing next to the pond, so I did.</font>

929
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:08,040
<font color="yellow">He paid me heavily for such a small favour.</font>

930
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:10,000
<font color="yellow">I clearly remember him.</font>

931
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,540
<font color="yellow">Okay, I see. Thank you.</font>

932
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,740
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

933
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,770
