159
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,190
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to come to the reunion today.</font>

160
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,860
<font color="yellow">Of course I'll be there.</font>

161
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,800
<font color="yellow">I think I'll be late.</font>

162
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,960
<font color="yellow">What time was it again?</font>

163
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,330
<font color="yellow">- It's at 6pm.
- It's at 6pm.</font>

164
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,390
<font color="yellow">There will be enough drinks at the reunion.</font>

165
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,460
<font color="yellow">(Director Seok)</font>

166
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,930
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director.</font>

167
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,630
<font color="yellow">Shim, are you all right?</font>

168
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,490
<font color="yellow">Yes. What is it?</font>

169
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,700
<font color="yellow">You don't sound so good.</font>

170
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,590
<font color="yellow">My throat is a bit hoarse. It's fine.</font>

171
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,590
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

172
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,230
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner tonight.</font>

173
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,030
<font color="yellow">I have a reunion to go to.</font>

174
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,200
<font color="yellow">How about tomorrow, then?</font>

175
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,490
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow works.</font>

176
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,500
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you instead.</font>

177
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,130
<font color="yellow">I'll choose the menu, too.</font>

178
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,190
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

179
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,790
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

180
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,890
<font color="yellow">Have fun at the reunion.</font>

181
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,960
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

182
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,490
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

183
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,790
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Go!</font>

184
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,230
<font color="yellow">- One.
- Two.</font>

185
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,640
<font color="yellow">- Three, four, five.
- Six.</font>

186
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,900
<font color="yellow">Seven, eight.</font>

187
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,030
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

188
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,850
<font color="yellow">why is Shim here? She never came before.</font>

189
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,960
<font color="yellow">Is she getting married?</font>

190
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,700
<font color="yellow">I hear people come out to reunions to hand out wedding invitations.</font>

191
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,630
<font color="yellow">Why would she drink like that if that's the case?</font>

192
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,390
<font color="yellow">- One more pint please.
- Okay.</font>

193
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,160
<font color="yellow">Attention please.</font>

194
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,760
<font color="yellow">I would like to take this chance...</font>

195
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,030
<font color="yellow">to propose to a beautiful lady today.</font>

196
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,090
<font color="yellow">She's the one who made me believe in love at first sight.</font>

197
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,730
<font color="yellow">My first love, Jee A.</font>

198
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
<font color="yellow">Kim Jee A.</font>

199
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,760
<font color="yellow">Will you marry me?</font>

200
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,570
<font color="yellow">Do a love shot!</font>

201
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:30,060
<font color="yellow">- Love shot!
- Love shot!</font>

202
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,560
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What is she doing?</font>

203
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,160
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

204
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,460
<font color="yellow">- Live happily ever after, okay?
- Thank you.</font>

205
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,390
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

206
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,430
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

207
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,960
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kid.</font>

208
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,640
<font color="yellow">What are you looking for?</font>

209
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
<font color="yellow">Let me help you.</font>

210
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,970
<font color="yellow">Well, have you ever seen...</font>

211
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,260
<font color="yellow">a lady with a wig like this?</font>

212
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,090
<font color="yellow">Are you playing hide-and-seek?</font>

213
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,760
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

214
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,060
<font color="yellow">She is so good at this game.</font>

215
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,530
<font color="yellow">I can't find her anywhere.</font>

216
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,650
<font color="yellow">Got it. Why don't you have my candy?</font>

217
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,580
<font color="yellow">It's too late. You need to go home.</font>

218
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,480
<font color="yellow">Let me find her for you.</font>

219
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,560
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- No problem.</font>

220
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,330
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

221
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,130
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. You found me.</font>

222
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,990
<font color="yellow">But how did you find me?</font>

223
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,430
<font color="yellow">You're the one who dumped me.</font>

224
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,860
<font color="yellow">Did you drink a lot?</font>

225
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,230
<font color="yellow">That is not what's important right now.</font>

226
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,960
<font color="yellow">Hold on for a second.</font>

227
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,590
<font color="yellow">After I got dumped by you yesterday, I got so mad.</font>

228
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,490
<font color="yellow">So I made a list of things that I hate about you.</font>

229
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,730
<font color="yellow">Listen up.</font>

230
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,990
<font color="yellow">First of all,</font>

231
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,160
<font color="yellow">you're broke.</font>

232
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,730
<font color="yellow">You live in a rooftop that costs 250 dollars a month.</font>

233
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,700
<font color="yellow">And secondly,</font>

234
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,230
<font color="yellow">you're messy.</font>

235
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,730
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean, right?</font>

236
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,630
<font color="yellow">Look at this picture.</font>

237
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,530
<font color="yellow">There is always dust in between your toes.</font>

238
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,230
<font color="yellow">Also, you eat food that was dropped on the ground.</font>

239
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,260
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

240
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,390
<font color="yellow">Now the third one is...</font>

241
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,390
<font color="yellow">This one is the best one.</font>

242
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,590
<font color="yellow">You're so cheesy.</font>

243
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,790
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

244
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,200
<font color="yellow">That wink is so cheesy.</font>

245
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,960
<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

246
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,530
<font color="yellow">And the fourth one is...</font>

247
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,930
<font color="yellow">Well, I can't read this out loud.</font>

248
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,230
<font color="yellow">I'll stop here.</font>

249
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,560
<font color="yellow">Shim. Let's go.</font>

250
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,700
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

251
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to know what the fourth one is?</font>

252
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,200
<font color="yellow">The fourth one is that you're...</font>

253
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,370
<font color="yellow">broke, messy...</font>

254
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,630
<font color="yellow">and even cheesy.</font>

255
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,030
<font color="yellow">It's hard to be like that.</font>

256
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,760
<font color="yellow">All right. It's time to go home.</font>

257
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,260
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

258
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,530
<font color="yellow">Tell me why you don't like me.</font>

259
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,990
<font color="yellow">Is it because you don't like girls with hair loss?</font>

260
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,330
<font color="yellow">Or is it because I am dumb?</font>

261
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,790
<font color="yellow">Is it because I am still terrible with the multiplication table?</font>

262
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,090
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

263
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,760
<font color="yellow">is it because I'm jobless?</font>

264
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

265
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,990
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that.</font>

266
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,530
<font color="yellow">It's not?</font>

267
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,860
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

268
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,130
<font color="yellow">is it because I almost killed you...</font>

269
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,790
<font color="yellow">with my plant when we first met?</font>

270
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,430
<font color="yellow">I told you. That was an accident.</font>

271
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,630
<font color="yellow">Or is it because the rent is too expensive?</font>

272
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,690
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a 20-dollar discount.</font>

273
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,730
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

274
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,630
<font color="yellow">Wait, now I know.</font>

275
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,330
<font color="yellow">Is it because I pull your hair whenever I get angry?</font>

276
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,730
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

277
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,590
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that.</font>

278
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,540
<font color="yellow">Is it because I once went into your room after I got drunk...</font>

279
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,560
<font color="yellow">and ate your soap and brushed my teeth with it?</font>

280
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,060
<font color="yellow">Is it because I pushed you for not eating the dumplings I got you?</font>

281
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,460
<font color="yellow">Gosh, there are too many.</font>

282
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,190
<font color="yellow">You don't like to see me drunk, either. Right?</font>

283
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,030
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm not pretty enough?</font>

284
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,730
<font color="yellow">I'm truly sorry about that.</font>

285
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,330
<font color="yellow">I can't do anything about that. I'm so sorry.</font>

286
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,400
<font color="yellow">Shim. You're drunk. Let's go home.</font>

287
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,660
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

288
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,060
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

289
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,860
<font color="yellow">Please tell me why you dumped me.</font>

290
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,430
<font color="yellow">Then I'll go home.</font>

291
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,660
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

292
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,060
<font color="yellow">No, don't say it.</font>

293
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,960
<font color="yellow">Wait. I want to know, so tell me.</font>

294
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,260
<font color="yellow">No, no. Don't say it.</font>

295
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,360
<font color="yellow">I'm ready.</font>

296
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,160
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

297
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,730
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

298
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,590
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

299
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,930
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

300
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,190
<font color="yellow">Don't ever tell me why you dumped me.</font>

301
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,430
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it.</font>

302
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,860
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

303
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,660
<font color="yellow">Get on.</font>

304
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,490
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

305
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,490
<font color="yellow">You don't know each other, do you?</font>

306
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,430
<font color="yellow">I'll introduce you.</font>

307
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,660
<font color="yellow">He's the secretary for the chairman, Lawyer Ahn Dan Tae.</font>

308
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,030
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Gong Mi works in our legal department.</font>

309
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,860
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

310
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

311
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,490
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

312
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,810
<font color="yellow">Have a good day. This is my floor.</font>

313
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,830
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,050
<font color="yellow">they will ask about our relationship.</font>

473
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,860
<font color="yellow">That'll end up revealing that I once kidnapped Joon Pyo.</font>

474
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,630
<font color="yellow">Could this be a work of Dan Tae?</font>

475
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,330
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that he's Soo Yong's son?</font>

476
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,880
<font color="yellow">He could have easily reported me to the police.</font>

477
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,450
<font color="yellow">Why do you think he didn't do it?</font>

478
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,660
<font color="yellow">It's because he doesn't know.</font>

479
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,250
<font color="yellow">Soo Yong probably didn't tell his son about it...</font>

480
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,130
<font color="yellow">since he was partially responsible.</font>

481
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,630
<font color="yellow">If it were you, would you tell Joon Soo?</font>

482
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,490
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

483
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,750
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I just hate the fact that Ahn Dan Tae works as a secretary...</font>

484
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,370
<font color="yellow">for the chairman. I hate seeing him around the company.</font>

485
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,060
<font color="yellow">I'll get rid of him soon, too.</font>

486
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,660
<font color="yellow">Prepare 300,000 dollars so I can pay the blackmailer tomorrow.</font>

487
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,490
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

488
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,640
<font color="yellow">Will you save 300,000 dollars and lose everything instead?</font>

489
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,860
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I get it.</font>

490
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,790
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare the money in cash.</font>

491
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,260
<font color="yellow">Where should I give it to you?</font>

492
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,030
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

493
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,190
<font color="yellow">We should talk.</font>

494
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,190
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

495
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,260
<font color="yellow">Something feels different between us, don't you think?</font>

496
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,560
<font color="yellow">If you felt that way too, then I guess things really have changed.</font>

497
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,190
<font color="yellow">Because I was feeling the same way.</font>

498
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,970
<font color="yellow">What do you think is the reason?</font>

499
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,230
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because we're not honest towards each other.</font>

500
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,060
<font color="yellow">If we were honest,</font>

501
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,100
<font color="yellow">then we wouldn't suspect or misunderstand each other.</font>

502
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,040
<font color="yellow">Then shall we ask each other questions and answer them honestly?</font>

503
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,060
<font color="yellow">Then it'll be up to ourselves to decide...</font>

504
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,330
<font color="yellow">how honest we're going to be.</font>

505
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,630
<font color="yellow">You've got a point.</font>

506
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,460
<font color="yellow">Only ourselves would know whether or not we're telling the truth.</font>

507
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,400
<font color="yellow">Ask me first.</font>

508
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,490
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

509
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,260
<font color="yellow">I want you to ask first.</font>

510
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,690
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll be the first to ask.</font>

511
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,660
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

512
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,800
<font color="yellow">could you check if someone by the name of Seok Joon Soo...</font>

513
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,630
<font color="yellow">ever booked your seminar room?</font>

514
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,390
<font color="yellow">No, he didn't.</font>

515
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,890
<font color="yellow">Did you really...</font>

516
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,230
<font color="yellow">attend a seminar at the Shindeahan Hotel last time?</font>

517
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

518
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,860
<font color="yellow">I told you that I attended a seminar at the hotel, but it was a lie.</font>

519
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,140
<font color="yellow">Then did you also lie about losing your badge?</font>

520
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,160
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

521
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,230
<font color="yellow">I really lost my badge.</font>

522
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,060
<font color="yellow">I parked my car on the side of the road to buy coffee.</font>

523
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,360
<font color="yellow">And I lost my bag with my badge.</font>

524
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,560
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you didn't give your badge to another executive?</font>

525
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,230
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

526
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,730
<font color="yellow">Is it...</font>

527
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,330
<font color="yellow">my turn to ask, now?</font>

528
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,890
<font color="yellow">Yes. Go ahead and ask.</font>

529
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,760
<font color="yellow">Is there another reason why...</font>

530
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,660
<font color="yellow">you're looking for the owner of the badge?</font>

531
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,790
<font color="yellow">It's not just to find the person who lost the badge, is it?</font>

532
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,830
<font color="yellow">What's the true reason behind all this investigation?</font>

533
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,630
<font color="yellow">It's to find Joon Pyo.</font>

534
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,860
<font color="yellow">That's why I couldn't tell you everything.</font>

535
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,790
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

536
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,360
<font color="yellow">When you lost your bag,</font>

537
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,250
<font color="yellow">are you sure you lost the jacket that had your badge on, as well?</font>

538
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,390
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

539
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,130
<font color="yellow">I would know better than anyone.</font>

540
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,460
<font color="yellow">Then the person who took your badge...</font>

541
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,830
<font color="yellow">is the criminal of Joon Pyo's case.</font>

542
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,230
<font color="yellow">The person who took the badge...</font>

543
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,100
<font color="yellow">is the criminal?</font>

544
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,790
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

545
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,940
<font color="yellow">The person who sent the badge to the company...</font>

546
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,670
<font color="yellow">left a small note with it.</font>

547
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,260
<font color="yellow">It was about Joon Pyo.</font>

548
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,480
<font color="yellow">The note said that the owner of the badge was the one who took Joon Pyo.</font>

549
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,530
<font color="yellow">That's why I was looking for the badge.</font>

550
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,490
<font color="yellow">Is that really true?</font>

551
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

552
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one more thing.</font>

553
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,230
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

554
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,160
<font color="yellow">Where were you really on the day you said you were at the seminar?</font>

555
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,390
<font color="yellow">I'm preparing to run my own business.</font>

556
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,630
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to run an independent business...</font>

557
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,430
<font color="yellow">outside of the family company.</font>

558
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,170
<font color="yellow">I went out to meet investors.</font>

559
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,960
<font color="yellow">That's why I couldn't tell anyone in the company.</font>

560
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,530
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

561
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,890
<font color="yellow">Shim knows about it, too.</font>

562
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,130
<font color="yellow">She came and helped me that day.</font>

563
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,990
<font color="yellow">She did?</font>

564
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,360
<font color="yellow">I like Shim.</font>

565
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,730
<font color="yellow">I want to make things work with her.</font>

566
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,930
<font color="yellow">I want her to be happy.</font>

567
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,890
<font color="yellow">I feel just the same.</font>

568
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,600
<font color="yellow">We may have answered each other's questions,</font>

569
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,530
<font color="yellow">but I'm not sure if we've become more comfortable with each other.</font>

570
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,490
<font color="yellow">We'll find out in time.</font>

571
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,730
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

572
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,960
<font color="yellow">Let's find out.</font>

573
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,790
<font color="yellow">I'll be going.</font>

574
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,230
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's really spicy.</font>

575
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,810
<font color="yellow">It wakes you up, doesn't it?</font>

576
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,360
<font color="yellow">My tongue feels numb.</font>

577
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,100
<font color="yellow">You really can't eat spicy food, can you?</font>

578
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,670
<font color="yellow">No, not really.</font>

579
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,660
<font color="yellow">When people feel irritated and stressed,</font>

580
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,790
<font color="yellow">they often eat spicy food to relieve their stress.</font>

581
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,960
<font color="yellow">But I guess you never really needed to do that before.</font>

582
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,860
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing me.</font>

583
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,230
<font color="yellow">I asked you to have dinner with me...</font>

584
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,060
<font color="yellow">because I felt irritated and stressed.</font>

585
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,890
<font color="yellow">Is it because of your new business?</font>

586
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

587
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,700
<font color="yellow">It's because of the people around me.</font>

588
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,190
<font color="yellow">People around you?</font>

589
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,830
<font color="yellow">Exactly who?</font>

590
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,490
<font color="yellow">Ms Gong Shim.</font>

591
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,440
<font color="yellow">The nakji character you drew is really popular.</font>

592
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,160
<font color="yellow">Our customers really like it.</font>

593
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,380
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

594
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,610
<font color="yellow">By the way, one of the customers...</font>

595
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,100
<font color="yellow">asked for your phone number.</font>

596
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,110
<font color="yellow">He wants to ask you for a character drawing, too.</font>

597
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,760
<font color="yellow">Can I give him your number?</font>

598
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's fine.</font>

599
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,390
<font color="yellow">Character drawing?</font>

600
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,810
<font color="yellow">Shim, what is he talking about?</font>

601
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,700
<font color="yellow">Didn't she tell you anything about it?</font>

602
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,130
<font color="yellow">Sir, that's enough.</font>

603
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,800
<font color="yellow">Look. This is the character I'm talking about.</font>

604
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,360
<font color="yellow">Shim won first prize in our nakji character drawing contest.</font>

605
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,860
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

606
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,160
<font color="yellow">Is it true, Shim?</font>

607
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,330
<font color="yellow">Yes. I received 50 nakjis for the prize.</font>

608
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,260
<font color="yellow">Wow. You got 50 nakjis?</font>

609
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,990
<font color="yellow">That's really amazing.</font>

610
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,080
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

611
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,740
<font color="yellow">Can I please have a new one?</font>

612
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,760
<font color="yellow">All right. I will give you one.</font>

613
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,970
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? It's nothing special.</font>

614
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,410
<font color="yellow">It was just a small contest.</font>

615
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,030
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? I really mean it.</font>

616
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not exaggerating. This is really amazing.</font>

617
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,860
<font color="yellow">Come on. That's too much.</font>

618
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,030
<font color="yellow">You can have as many nakjis as you want.</font>

619
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,230
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

620
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,260
<font color="yellow">Shim, here.</font>

621
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,860
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

622
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,730
<font color="yellow">Can you sign it for me? I'm going to keep it.</font>

623
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,230
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

624
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,790

631
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,960
<font color="yellow">I didn't write your company title.</font>

632
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,130
<font color="yellow">- I'll keep it well.
- Thank you.</font>

633
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,960
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you smile.</font>

634
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

635
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,320
<font color="yellow">Shall we go to the cinema?</font>

636
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,660
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to go shopping?</font>

637
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,030
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

638
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,790
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I can't. My new bed is coming today.</font>

639
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,790
<font color="yellow">A new bed?</font>

640
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,690
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

641
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,630
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the nakji.</font>

642
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,160
<font color="yellow">I can eat 43 more nakjis for free.</font>

643
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,890
<font color="yellow">Call me when you want to eat something spicy.</font>

644
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,190
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll call you.</font>

645
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,800
<font color="yellow">You should go before your new bed arrives.</font>

646
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,360
<font color="yellow">- Okay. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.</font>

647
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,690
<font color="yellow">- You should leave now.
- Okay.</font>

648
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,390
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

649
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

650
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,630
<font color="yellow">It looks so delicious.</font>

651
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,330
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you assembled Shim's new bed yet?</font>

652
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,630
<font color="yellow">Let me eat first.</font>

653
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,760
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to eat?
- I had it already.</font>

654
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,030
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

655
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,640
<font color="yellow">I'll go and make room for my new bed.</font>

656
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,090
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

657
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,910
<font color="yellow">Eat well before you assemble her bed. It won't be easy.</font>

658
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,130
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

659
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,590
<font color="yellow">There's a lot.</font>

660
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,830
<font color="yellow">Hey, I should invite Dan Tae over to come eat with us.</font>

661
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,260
<font color="yellow">- Sure. Tell him to come down.
- Okay.</font>

662
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,040
<font color="yellow">You surprised me again.</font>

663
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,060
<font color="yellow">I didn't intend to.</font>

664
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,490
<font color="yellow">I was really just on my way home.</font>

665
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:33,990
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

666
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,010
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

667
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,350
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't. What about you?</font>

668
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,690
<font color="yellow">Join me then. Please come in.</font>

669
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,710
<font color="yellow">I'll just eat by myself today.</font>

670
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you turning me down?</font>

671
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,990
<font color="yellow">You used to bone a fish for me.</font>

672
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,860
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Come in.</font>

673
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,120
<font color="yellow">I'm really fine.</font>

674
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,580
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go. It's okay.</font>

675
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,660
<font color="yellow">- I...
- Let's go in. It's okay.</font>

676
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,890
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat.
- Oh, dear.</font>

677
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,660
<font color="yellow">There we go.</font>

678
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,160
<font color="yellow">This will do.</font>

679
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,030
<font color="yellow">Dad, should I open that box for the bed?</font>

680
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,990
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

681
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,760
<font color="yellow">Can you give him a bowl of rice?</font>

682
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,960
<font color="yellow">It's a bit spicy, but it's good.</font>

683
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,970
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Shim?</font>

684
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:36,530
<font color="yellow">Give him some rice to eat.</font>

685
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

686
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,230
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

687
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,830
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

688
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,190
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the meal.</font>

689
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,960
<font color="yellow">Shim won this nakji...</font>

690
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,830
<font color="yellow">as a prize for a character drawing contest.</font>

691
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shim.</font>

692
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,330
<font color="yellow">Bring us the dish mat.</font>

693
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,510
<font color="yellow">The one you got from the nakji place.</font>

694
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,960
<font color="yellow">That's right. Let's use the mat. Get three of them.</font>

695
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,930
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

696
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,960
<font color="yellow">Isn't her drawing amazing?</font>

697
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Shim? Join us.</font>

698
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,160
<font color="yellow">Sit with us.</font>

699
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,410
<font color="yellow">When she was in middle school,</font>

700
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,190
<font color="yellow">she wanted to go to an art academy.</font>

701
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,960
<font color="yellow">But we couldn't afford that.</font>

702
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,960
<font color="yellow">So instead, we just scolded her...</font>

703
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,800
<font color="yellow">by saying that she wasn't talented enough.</font>

704
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,210
<font color="yellow">If we let her learn art, she would've had a different life.</font>

705
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,030
<font color="yellow">Now she's just doing part-time jobs.</font>

706
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,890
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Shim.</font>

707
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,890
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

708
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,790
<font color="yellow">My business failed.</font>

709
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,830
<font color="yellow">I'm crying because this nakji is way too spicy.</font>

710
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the lunch. I'll get going now.</font>

711
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,260
<font color="yellow">You ate so fast.</font>

712
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,830
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

713
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,260
<font color="yellow">Can you assemble the new bed? It'll help with your digestion.</font>

714
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,410
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
- Right.</font>

715
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,760
<font color="yellow">That's what young people should do.</font>

716
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,890
<font color="yellow">I feel so guilty when I ask your father to do house chores for me.</font>

717
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,360
<font color="yellow">Can you help us?</font>

718
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:48,890
<font color="yellow">Of course, I can.</font>

719
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,770
<font color="yellow">Shim, go and get him our tool box.</font>

720
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,860
<font color="yellow">Help him in case he needs a hand.</font>

721
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,030
<font color="yellow">Can you hold that for me?</font>

722
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,590
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

723
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,660
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

724
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,230
<font color="yellow">Dan Tae.</font>

725
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,790
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

726
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,630
<font color="yellow">About last night...</font>

727
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,960
<font color="yellow">Yes. What about it?</font>

728
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,160
<font color="yellow">I mean, last night...</font>

729
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,360
<font color="yellow">What about it?</font>

730
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,130
<font color="yellow">It was an accident.</font>

731
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,860
<font color="yellow">Did you hear me?</font>

732
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,590
<font color="yellow">It was like a car accident.</font>

733
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,190
<font color="yellow">I never expected that would happen.</font>

734
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,230
<font color="yellow">It was an accident that was never supposed to happen.</font>

735
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,230
<font color="yellow">Was it?</font>

736
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

737
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,030
<font color="yellow">Let's say it was a mistake on the both of us.</font>

738
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,630
<font color="yellow">There was no victim or assaulter.</font>

739
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,060
<font color="yellow">Are you looking at me now?</font>

740
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,530
<font color="yellow">You don't want another accident to happen.</font>

741
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,830
<font color="yellow">It wasn't an accident.</font>

742
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,130
<font color="yellow">I did it because I wanted to.</font>

743
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,260
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to care about what you think...</font>

744
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,430
<font color="yellow">from now on.</font>

745
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,930
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you accept me or not.</font>

746
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,690
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to worry.</font>

747
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,260
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to...</font>

748
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,890
<font color="yellow">cook for you whenever I feel like it.</font>

749
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going to draw your face whenever I want to.</font>

750
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,430
<font color="yellow">And I'm going to talk to you...</font>

751
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,660
<font color="yellow">whenever I want to.</font>

752
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,860
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm going to do.</font>

753
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,860
<font color="yellow">So you shouldn't care about what I do, either.</font>

754
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,890
<font color="yellow">You can just keep doing things your way.</font>

755
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,360
<font color="yellow">I'll do the same.</font>

756
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,460
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't give me the green light,</font>

757
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,130
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to go straight ahead.</font>

758
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,460
<font color="yellow">And that's not how you assemble a bed.</font>

759
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,260
<font color="yellow">Let me do it.</font>

760
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,440
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

761
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,490
<font color="yellow">Let's eat dinner and go to the movies together tonight.</font>

762
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

763
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,490
<font color="yellow">We used to do that. I feel so distant.</font>

764
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,330
<font color="yellow">Let's have some mother and son time.</font>

765
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,880
<font color="yellow">If you have a plan, cancel it. Do your work tomorrow, too.</font>

766
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,890
<font color="yellow">I'll buy movie tickets and make a reservation for dinner.</font>

767
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:31,490
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the tickets and the reservation.</font>

768
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,230
<font color="yellow">Stay home.</font>

769
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,570
<font color="yellow">I'll get off work early to pick you up.</font>

770
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,260
<font color="yellow">Will you do that for me?</font>

771
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,260
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

772
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,560
<font color="yellow">My son is the best.</font>

773
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,260
<font color="yellow">Have a great day at work. Thank you, Joon Soo.</font>

774
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,960
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

775
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,660
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you later.
- Bye.</font>

776
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,090
<font color="yellow">My goodness. There you are, my son!</font>

777
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,520
<font color="yellow">My son.</font>

778
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,620
