328
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,700

329
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,930

<font color="yellow">Joon Pyo.</font>

334
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,430

336
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,770
<font color="yellow">Joon Pyo, don't ever leave me again.</font>

337
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,470
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

338
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,970
<font color="yellow">I won't go anywhere.</font>

339
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,700
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

340
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,800
<font color="yellow">I won't go anywhere, Grandmother.</font>

341
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,204
<font color="yellow">Until we find the suspect,</font>

342
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,246
<font color="yellow">no one should know that I'm Joon Pyo...</font>

343
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:48,730
<font color="yellow">apart from you and me.</font>

344
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,600
<font color="yellow">We have to keep it a secret no matter what.</font>

345
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,530
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

346
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,500
<font color="yellow">Since you insist on catching the suspect, we'll have to do that.</font>

347
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,630
<font color="yellow">The person who kidnapped me is in Star Group.</font>

348
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,200
<font color="yellow">In order to find him,</font>

349
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,530
<font color="yellow">I need a position in the company.</font>

350
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

351
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
<font color="yellow">I need to be active inside of the company with no restraint.</font>

352
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,717
<font color="yellow">In order to do so, I'll need your support.</font>

353
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,630
<font color="yellow">I think being the chairman's secretary will do the job.</font>

354
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,970
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

355
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,600
<font color="yellow">Then I'll appoint my current secretary to somewhere else...</font>

356
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,530
<font color="yellow">and make a vacant position. Does that sound okay to you?</font>

357
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, Grandmother.</font>

358
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you ordering my secretary to leave?</font>

359
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

360
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,030
<font color="yellow">So this person...</font>

361
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,753
<font color="yellow">Ahn Dan Tae is your secretary?</font>

362
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:43,730
<font color="yellow">I hired him temporarily since we have a vacant secretary position.</font>

363
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,830
<font color="yellow">Grandmother.</font>

364
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,000
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep crying?</font>

365
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,430
<font color="yellow">Every time I think about the day you told me you were Joon Pyo,</font>

366
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,970
<font color="yellow">I can't help but cry.</font>

367
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,930
<font color="yellow">Grandmother.</font>

368
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,570
<font color="yellow">I thought the suspect would show up at the arboretum.</font>

369
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,700
<font color="yellow">But no one did.</font>

370
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
<font color="yellow">Joon Pyo.</font>

371
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,930
<font color="yellow">I don't need to find the suspect any more.</font>

372
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,500
<font color="yellow">I'm already grateful to have you back.</font>

373
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,600
<font color="yellow">I'm more worried that you might be put in danger...</font>

374
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,300
<font color="yellow">while looking for the suspect.</font>

375
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,530
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

376
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,230
<font color="yellow">want to tell everyone...</font>

377
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,930
<font color="yellow">that I found Joon Pyo.</font>

378
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,104
<font color="yellow">I want to live with you...</font>

379
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:51,470
<font color="yellow">and go everywhere together.</font>

380
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,670
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Grandmother.</font>

381
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,430
<font color="yellow">Please wait a little longer.</font>

382
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,000
<font color="yellow">The suspect not only kidnapped me,</font>

383
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,330
<font color="yellow">but he also made my mother die in a car accident.</font>

384
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,400
<font color="yellow">And he's also...</font>

385
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,200
<font color="yellow">the same person that put my dad into a coma.</font>

386
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
<font color="yellow">I have to...</font>

387
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,970
<font color="yellow">catch the suspect no matter what.</font>

388
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,770
<font color="yellow">So please wait a little longer, Grandmother.</font>

389
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

390
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,130
<font color="yellow">It must be so hard on you.</font>

391
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,930
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

392
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,830
<font color="yellow">have any good news?</font>

393
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,130

<font color="yellow">Something...</font>

395
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,330
<font color="yellow">has been on my mind lately.</font>

396
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,430
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

397
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,300
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

398
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,143
<font color="yellow">There's a girl I really like.</font>

399
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,470
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

400
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,330
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

401
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,380
<font color="yellow">You should introduce her to me.</font>

402
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,100
<font color="yellow">My heart is beating so fast.</font>

403
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,570
<font color="yellow">Joon Pyo.</font>

404
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,130
<font color="yellow">I'm dying to know who she is.</font>

405
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,430
<font color="yellow">I really like her.</font>

406
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,230
<font color="yellow">But I can't tell her that I do.</font>

407
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,470
<font color="yellow">It's torturing me, and I feel sorry.</font>

408
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,200
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

409
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,870
<font color="yellow">I can't tell if I'm Joon Pyo or Dan Tae any more.</font>

410
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,970
<font color="yellow">I assume I should live as Dan Tae until I catch the suspect.</font>

411
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,500
<font color="yellow">Also, the father that raised me...</font>

412
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,930
<font color="yellow">is at a state where he could pass away any moment.</font>

413
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,170
<font color="yellow">Grandmother.</font>

414
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
<font color="yellow">I don't want the girl I like...</font>

415
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,730
<font color="yellow">to know about...</font>

416
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,170
<font color="yellow">all the mess I'm going through.</font>

417
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,200
<font color="yellow">I want to treat her in all honesty.</font>

418
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,470
<font color="yellow">But if I can't tell her everything about me,</font>

419
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,670
<font color="yellow">how can I accept her feelings?</font>

420
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,430
<font color="yellow">I like her,</font>

421
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,570
<font color="yellow">but I can't say it.</font>

422
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,800
<font color="yellow">It's so tough.</font>

423
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,370
<font color="yellow">What will you do if she misunderstands and leaves you?</font>

424
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,800
<font color="yellow">That's what I fear the most.</font>

425

<font color="yellow">Out of this and that, which do you think is better?</font>

471
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,700
<font color="yellow">This one.</font>

472
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,970
<font color="yellow">This one? Okay. I'll give this to him.</font>

473
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,830
<font color="yellow">Shim, about that movie ticket...</font>

474
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,320
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I already told you it's fine.</font>

475
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,807
<font color="yellow">Don't worry so much.</font>

476
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:15,657
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to something, you can just tell me.</font>

477
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:17,040
<font color="yellow">I'd prefer that.</font>

478
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,730
<font color="yellow">I'm completely fine.</font>

479
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,314
<font color="yellow">Take care, then.</font>

480
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,330
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

481
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,370
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that. What I wanted to say was...</font>

482
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,970
<font color="yellow">You don't have to feel sorry. It's nothing.</font>

483
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,830
<font color="yellow">It just means that I failed today.</font>

484
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

485
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,040
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who failed.</font>

486
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,870
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

487
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,630
<font color="yellow">To get a haircut.</font>

488
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,146
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

489
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:19,570
<font color="yellow">I always wanted to point out your hair. That's good.</font>

490
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,330
<font color="yellow">I have to get my hair done, too. I'll come with you.</font>

491
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,700
<font color="yellow">Do you go to the salon for your wigs?</font>

492
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,130
<font color="yellow">No, my real hair. Let's go.</font>

493
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,130
<font color="yellow">I'm going to a barber shop.</font>

494
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,200
<font color="yellow">- Really?
-  Yes.</font>

495
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,200
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

496
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,070
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

497
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,230
<font color="yellow">Hello. Please follow me.</font>

498
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

499
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,700
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

500
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,990
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hey, Dan Tae.</font>

501
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,260
<font color="yellow">Are you here for a haircut?</font>

502
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,270
<font color="yellow">No, I'm here for a treatment.</font>

503
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,500
<font color="yellow">My daughter suggested that I should take care of my hair.</font>

504
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,000
<font color="yellow">Shim's such a good daughter.</font>

505
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,890
<font color="yellow">Please give my father a lot of nutrients for his hair.</font>

506
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

507
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,453
<font color="yellow">As for this guy, if you cut his sides too short,</font>

508
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,480
<font color="yellow">he ends up looking like an old man.</font>

509
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,526
<font color="yellow">And if his bangs are too long,</font>

510
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:57,540
<font color="yellow">he looks cheesy, so that won't do. But then if it's too short,</font>

511
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,029
<font color="yellow">it'll make him look dumb.</font>

512
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:04,330
<font color="yellow">And this part here. He has too much hair here, so it's puffy.</font>

513
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,040
<font color="yellow">It makes him look shabby.</font>

514
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,230
<font color="yellow">So please give him a good haircut.</font>

515
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,830
<font color="yellow">How would you like your hair?</font>

516
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,430
<font color="yellow">Just like what she told you.</font>

517
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

518
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

519
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,600
<font color="yellow">Don't cut too much of his sides.</font>

520
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,040
<font color="yellow">- Let's shampoo your hair.
-  Okay.</font>

521
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,540
<font color="yellow">- This way.
-  Okay.</font>

522
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum.</font>

523
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

524
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,424
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

525
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:15,970
<font color="yellow">It'll take me five minutes.</font>

526
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,087
<font color="yellow">- Dad.
-  Yes?</font>

527
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,670
<font color="yellow">I have to go buy summer sheets with Mum.</font>

528
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,500
<font color="yellow">- I have to go.
-  Okay.</font>

529
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, Dan Tae.</font>

530
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,730
<font color="yellow">Did you hear?</font>

531
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:54,900
<font color="yellow">Shim is going on a business trip to draw.</font>

532
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,500
<font color="yellow">A business trip?</font>

533
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,624
<font color="yellow">That owner from the nakji restaurant...</font>

534
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,800
<font color="yellow">introduced her to a sashimi place in the suburbs.</font>

535
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,430
<font color="yellow">She's so excited to earn money from her drawings.</font>

536
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,173
<font color="yellow">That's great news.</font>

537
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:11,630
<font color="yellow">But my wife and I have to go to the hospital for our check-ups tomorrow.</font>

538
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,720
<font color="yellow">I feel bad about not driving her.</font>

539
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,070
<font color="yellow">She must have a lot of baggage.</font>

540
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,420
<font color="yellow">I'll go with her then.</font>

541
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,930
<font color="yellow">I told her that she should ask you,</font>

542
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,130
<font color="yellow">but she told me that you've been really busy lately.</font>

543
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,130
<font color="yellow">Luckily, tomorrow is pretty open for me.</font>

544
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,300
<font color="yellow">Is that so? I'd be so thankful if you did.</font>

545
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,533
<font color="yellow">Okay, then I'll go with Shim tomorrow.</font>

546
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:37,621
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

547
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,730
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

548
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,270
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine going alone, right?</font>

549
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,200
<font color="yellow">Should I ask Dan Tae to go with me?</font>

550
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,330
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

551
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,240
<font color="yellow">He'll be busy for sure.</font>

552
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,900
<font color="yellow">Goo Nam.</font>

553
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,040
<font color="yellow">I don't need a King Lunchbox today.</font>

554
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,600
<font color="yellow">Do you have dinner plans?</font>

555
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,660
<font color="yellow">I'll pass for today.</font>

556
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,970
<font color="yellow">Let me know when you need it.</font>

557
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,700
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

558
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,130
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving now?</font>

559
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,400
<font color="yellow">We'll hit traffic if we don't hurry.</font>

560
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,900
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  You're going on a business trip.</font>

561
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,600
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

562
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,970
<font color="yellow">Your dad asked me to go with you.</font>

563
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,780
<font color="yellow">Are you really coming with me?</font>

564
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,900
<font color="yellow">You?</font>

565
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,370
<font color="yellow">Well, your dad asked me a favour.</font>

566
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,170
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything else to do, either.</font>

567
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,230
<font color="yellow">Do you like sashimi?</font>

568
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,420
<font color="yellow">I'm going to a sashimi restaurant.</font>

569
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,130
<font color="yellow">The owner promised me a lot of free sashimi.</font>

570
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,630
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't have tasted as good if I went alone. I'm glad.</font>

571
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,230
<font color="yellow">We'll be late for the bus. Let's go.</font>

572
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

573
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,970
<font color="yellow">Let's take this car.</font>

574
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,400
<font color="yellow">I brought it from the office.</font>

575
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,373
<font color="yellow">Isn't it tiring to drive?</font>

576
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:50,500
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

577
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,830
<font color="yellow">If you're sleepy, take a nap.</font>

578
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,130
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

579
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,070
<font color="yellow">It's rude to sleep when someone's driving.</font>

580
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,200
<font color="yellow">I stayed up late drawing up some drafts.</font>

581
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
<font color="yellow">Gum.</font>

582
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,200
<font color="yellow">This gum is waking me up.</font>

583
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,970
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

584
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,900
<font color="yellow">I have to stay awake.</font>

585
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,870
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

586
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,670
<font color="yellow">Gong Shim...</font>

587
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,500
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

588
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I dozed off, didn't I?</font>

589
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,380
<font color="yellow">You should be careful.</font>

590
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,830
<font color="yellow">I borrowed this car from the office.</font>

591
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,210
<font color="yellow">I thought you broke the window.</font>

592
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

593
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,700
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

594
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,030
<font color="yellow">Should we stop at a rest area?</font>

595
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,330
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

596
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,030
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

597
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,430
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is really heavy.</font>

598
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:08,930
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

599
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,220
<font color="yellow">- Give me that.
-  No, I'm okay.</font>

600
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,030
<font color="yellow">Just give it to me.</font>

601
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,150
<font color="yellow">There we go. All done.</font>

602
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,440
<font color="yellow">- You're 32 years old?
-  Yes.</font>

603
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,430
<font color="yellow">I wish you were my son-in-law.</font>

604
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,770
<font color="yellow">My daughter's perfect for you.</font>

605
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,477
<font color="yellow">My younger daughter is 32 years old, too.</font>

606
00:46:26,477 --> 00:46:27,807
<font color="yellow">Her name is Bae Eun Sol.</font>

607
00:46:27,807 --> 00:46:29,124
<font color="yellow">She's a pretty one.</font>

608
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:30,500
<font color="yellow">Stop that.</font>

609
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,300
<font color="yellow">It's rude to say something like that to a stranger.</font>

610
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:39,030
<font color="yellow">Instead of Eun Sol, our eldest has to go first.</font>

611
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,700
<font color="yellow">That's true. What do you think about older women?</font>

612
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,400
<font color="yellow">My older daughter's name is Bae Eun Chae.</font>

613
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,670
<font color="yellow">She's a little older than you.</font>

614
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,070
<font color="yellow">She's 39 years old.</font>

615
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,500
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

616
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,270
<font color="yellow">Were you helping this couple?</font>

617
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

618
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,700
<font color="yellow">We should go, Honey.</font>

619
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,170
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
-  Bye.</font>

620
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,130
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Honey.</font>

621
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

622
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,830
<font color="yellow">Get on, Honey.</font>

623
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:31,930
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

624
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,160
<font color="yellow">I only called you "Honey"...</font>

625
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,080
<font color="yellow">because I thought you were in an awkward position.</font>

626
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,530
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to help.</font>

627
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,973
<font color="yellow">I wasn't trying to make a move on you. I promise.</font>

628
00:47:42,973 --> 00:47:44,200
<font color="yellow">Please don't misunderstand me.</font>

629
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

630
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:49,830
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

631
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,930
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

632
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:54,930
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

633
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,730
<font color="yellow">Are you free tomorrow?</font>

634
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,010
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Tomorrow?</font>

635
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,930
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have dinner with you.</font>

636
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,830
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to thank you properly.</font>

637
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,920
<font color="yellow">Director Seok's dad and grandmother all love me.</font>

638
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,970
<font color="yellow">His mum loves me even more.</font>

639
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:41,230
<font color="yellow">You ruined it all by beating up his mum.</font>

640
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,000
<font color="yellow">Mi, don't worry.</font>

641
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,480
<font color="yellow">I can't help you, but I won't drag you down.</font>

642
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,530
<font color="yellow">I'll meet with Tae Hee...</font>

643
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,680
<font color="yellow">No. I'll see Director Seok's mother and sort it out.</font>

644
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,900
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

645
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,670
<font color="yellow">Beg on my knees.</font>

646
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,540
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to it.</font>

647
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,570
<font color="yellow">I'll just go on my knees and beg until she forgives me.</font>

648
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,870
<font color="yellow">I have no pride.</font>

649
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,930
<font color="yellow">I'll do anything for both my daughters.</font>

650
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,930
<font color="yellow">Then when should the parents meet each other?</font>

651
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,000
<font color="yellow">We're not that serious yet.</font>

652
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,090
<font color="yellow">What? You're not?</font>

653
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,614
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  Then why did you bring it up?</font>

654
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:28,090
<font color="yellow">I begged on my knees a million times in my head just now.</font>

655
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,707
<font color="yellow">You hurt my pride.</font>

656
00:49:29,707 --> 00:49:32,600
<font color="yellow">I didn't have to imagine begging to Tae Hee.</font>

657
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my pride.</font>

658
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,970
<font color="yellow">Next time, be more specific.</font>

659
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,600
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

660
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,773
<font color="yellow">Yongwangnim Nakji's owner sent me here to draw your mural.</font>

661
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:17,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

662
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,030
<font color="yellow">We have another one?</font>

663
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,873
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask so many people for recommendations?</font>

664
00:50:25,873 --> 00:50:27,100
<font color="yellow">What a mess.</font>

665
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,100
<font color="yellow">You're a troublemaker.</font>

666
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,670
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

667
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,770
<font color="yellow">We left Busan last night to come for this.</font>

668
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,490
<font color="yellow">You came from so far away. We should go with you.</font>

669
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,660
<font color="yellow">I broke my leg this morning, but I came anyway...</font>

670
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,073
<font color="yellow">with my crutches to keep my promise.</font>

671
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:45,530
<font color="yellow">You risked injuries to come here.</font>

672
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,570
<font color="yellow">We should go with you.</font>

673
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about this.</font>

674
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,300
<font color="yellow">I guess you have no choice.</font>

675
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,130
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

676
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,900
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

677
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

678
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,670
<font color="yellow">It's because you married an incompetent man.</font>

679
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,670
<font color="yellow">You're always working day and night. I'm so sorry.</font>

680
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,170
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

681
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,100
<font color="yellow">When we get enough money,</font>

682
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,700
<font color="yellow">let's have a proper wedding.</font>

683
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

684
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

685
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,700
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

686
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,900
<font color="yellow">The only reason why I called you "Honey" was because...</font>

687
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:57,300
<font color="yellow">I thought you would lose the job after coming all the way here.</font>

688
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,800
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm thankful for what you did.</font>

689
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,830
<font color="yellow">Draw it here like this. Okay?</font>

690
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,580
<font color="yellow">Thank you for letting me draw.</font>

691
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,900
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

692
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,630
<font color="yellow">Stop staring at her. She'll wear out.</font>

693
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,370
<font color="yellow">You're a lucky man.</font>

694
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,400
<font color="yellow">Your wife is a good catch.</font>

695
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,200
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

696
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,000
<font color="yellow">How did you two meet?</font>

697
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,030
<font color="yellow">I chased her around because I liked her.</font>

698
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,400
<font color="yellow">Can you pass me the eraser,</font>

699
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,000
<font color="yellow">Honey?</font>

700
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

701
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,630
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

702
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

703
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,130
<font color="yellow">Sir, can I start painting it?</font>

704
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,000
<font color="yellow">Didn't the owner of Yongwangnim Nakji tell you?</font>

705
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,830
<font color="yellow">I have a gathering happening here tonight.</font>

706
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,530
<font color="yellow">I asked him to tell you that you should paint after they're gone.</font>

707
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,630
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't get that message.</font>

708
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,130
<font color="yellow">I left some food for you in the room. You should eat.</font>

709
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,030
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

710
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,073
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

711
00:54:17,073 --> 00:54:18,200
<font color="yellow">Help yourself.</font>

712
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,470
<font color="yellow">It's really good.</font>

713
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,604
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I think they'll be here for a while.</font>

714
00:54:25,604 --> 00:54:27,560
<font color="yellow">Come with me. Eat this later.</font>

715
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,190
<font color="yellow">- Turn the stove off.
-  What?</font>

716
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,660
<font color="yellow">Good. Follow me.</font>

717
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,130
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
-  Just come along.</font>

718
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,470
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

719
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,350
<font color="yellow">They're newly-weds from Seoul.</font>

720
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,830
<font color="yellow">They came here to draw our mural.</font>

721
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,600
<font color="yellow">Have a drink.</font>

722
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,280
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I have to drive later.</font>

723
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,090
<font color="yellow">Just take one.</font>

724
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,470
<font color="yellow">I have to draw.</font>

725
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,273
<font color="yellow">You guys are boring for your age.</font>

726
00:54:54,273 --> 00:54:56,604
<font color="yellow">Then sing us a song instead.</font>

727
00:54:56,604 --> 00:55:00,650
<font color="yellow">If they're good, you'll let them draw at your restaurants, right?</font>

728
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,470
<font color="yellow">- Of course, of course.
-  Yes.</font>

729
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:09,577
<font color="yellow">- Sing!
-  Sing!</font>

730
00:55:09,577 --> 00:55:10,900
<font color="yellow">- Sing!
-  Come on.</font>

731
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,100
<font color="yellow">Applause.</font>

732
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,990
<font color="yellow">I feel like you might pop if I touch you</font>

733
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,000
<font color="yellow">- Awesome.
-  Nice.</font>

734
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:33,230
<font color="yellow">I'll call you a flower</font>

735
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:43,100
<font color="yellow">I miss you so much that I can't handle it</font>

736
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,320
<font color="yellow">And the feeling spreads in my heart</font>

737
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,570
<font color="yellow">- Great!
-  Wow!</font>

738
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,400
<font color="yellow">Your shy</font>

739
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:58,170
<font color="yellow">Confession</font>

740
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:04,700
<font color="yellow">My heart's burning inside</font>

741
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:12,430
<font color="yellow">My heart is like a volcano</font>

742
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,430
<font color="yellow">That's about to erupt</font>

743
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,270
<font color="yellow">- One more time!
-  One more time!</font>

744
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,656
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
-  Cheers!</font>

745
00:56:47,656 --> 00:56:48,830
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

746
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,080
<font color="yellow">I hear you two are a great match.</font>

747
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,100
<font color="yellow">But why don't you have any kids?</font>

748
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,090
<font color="yellow">If they take after you, they will be so beautiful.</font>

749
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,990
<font color="yellow">You should have a kid even if you don't have money.</font>

750
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,170
<font color="yellow">Do you know how happy those little toes make you?</font>

751
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,990
<font color="yellow">They can make one tonight.</font>

752
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,287
<font color="yellow">That sounds good.</font>

753
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:19,720
<font color="yellow">- Make one.
-  Make one.</font>

754
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,570
<font color="yellow">We're going to be really loud today, so don't mind us.</font>

755
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,430
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

756
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,830
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

757
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:37,580
<font color="yellow">- Good luck.
-  Good luck.</font>

758
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,000
<font color="yellow">- Make one.
-  Make one.</font>

759
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,270
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

760
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,670
<font color="yellow">Sir, when can we start painting?</font>

761
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,900
<font color="yellow">I think they'll stay a while longer.</font>

762
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,300
<font color="yellow">I don't think you can paint today.</font>

763
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,800
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  What?</font>

764
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,770
<font color="yellow">Sleep for tonight,</font>

765
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,610
<font color="yellow">and we can start tomorrow.</font>

766
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,400
<font color="yellow">You only need one set of bedding, right?</font>

767
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,700
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

768
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,163
<font color="yellow">Do you have another room?</font>

769
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:19,730
<font color="yellow">No. Of course not.</font>

770
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,400
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

771
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,770
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear everyone?</font>

772
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,000
<font color="yellow">Good luck tonight.</font>

773
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,300
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

774
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,877
<font color="yellow">Shim. Instead of standing up,</font>

775
00:59:01,877 --> 00:59:04,300
<font color="yellow">you can lie down on this. I'll set it out for you.</font>

776
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

777
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,030
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

778
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,100
<font color="yellow">You just look really uncomfortable.</font>

779
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,800
<font color="yellow">It's okay with me. You can take it off.</font>

780
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

781
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,656
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that.</font>

782
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:27,300
<font color="yellow">I meant that you should take off your wig.</font>

783
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,330
<font color="yellow">Do you want to shower first?</font>

784
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,100
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

785
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,746
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

786
00:59:33,746 --> 00:59:35,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I keep making these mistakes.</font>

787
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,170
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, Dan Tae?</font>

788
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,770
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

789
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,370
<font color="yellow">I'll set the blankets and lie down first.</font>

790
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

791
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,900
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go out for some fresh air.</font>

792
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,100
<font color="yellow">Okay, go ahead.</font>

793
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,620
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me to fall sleep at a new place,</font>

794
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,630
<font color="yellow">so I won't be sleeping. Take your time.</font>

795
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,900
<font color="yellow">- Okay, I'll be back.
-  Bye.</font>

796
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,000
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's so hot.</font>

797
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:33,530
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

798
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,330
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

799
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,070
<font color="yellow">Shim, you should lie down and sleep.</font>

800
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,700
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

801
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

802
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you for liking me all this time.</font>

803
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

804
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,170
<font color="yellow">Can you stay a bit longer...</font>

805
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,770
<font color="yellow">and wait for me?</font>

806
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,230
<font color="yellow">Will you?</font>

807
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,170
<font color="yellow">Shim.</font>

808
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,930
<font color="yellow">Did you wake up?</font>

809
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,140
<font color="yellow">When did you wake up, Shim?</font>

810
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,170
<font color="yellow">A while ago.</font>

811
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,700
<font color="yellow">Do you need help with anything?</font>

812
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,670
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

813
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,690
<font color="yellow">can you please draw the octopus' eyes...</font>

814
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,700
<font color="yellow">more clearly with thicker lines?</font>

815
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,400
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

816
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,500
<font color="yellow">It's finished.</font>

817
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,200
<font color="yellow">This looks great.</font>

818
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,200
<font color="yellow">This looks really amazing, Shim.</font>

819
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

820
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dan Tae.</font>

821
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,670
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

822
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,300
<font color="yellow">What a masterpiece!</font>

823
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,800
<font color="yellow">I really love it, Shim.</font>

824
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,927
<font color="yellow">Please take this.</font>

825
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,020
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

826
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:59,130
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your work.</font>

827
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,300
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

828
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
<font color="yellow">Honey?</font>

829
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,100
<font color="yellow">Why don't we take a photo in front of your drawing, Honey?</font>

830
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,230
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

831
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,430
<font color="yellow">All right, here we go. In 1, 2, 3.</font>

832
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,430
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

833
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,900
<font color="yellow">You should take a photo with your husband, too.</font>

834
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
<font color="yellow">Stand there.</font>

835
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,314
<font color="yellow">Why are you so awkward when you're married?</font>

836
01:04:39,314 --> 01:04:41,430
<font color="yellow">You should be hugging each other like this.</font>

837
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,970
<font color="yellow">There you go. In 1, 2, 3.</font>
