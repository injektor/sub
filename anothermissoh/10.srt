00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,200
Let go of me! Let go!

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,300
Let me go!

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,500
<i>[Episode 10: On My Way to You]</i>

5
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,480
<i>Dad, you're surrounded by me!</i>

6
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,140
I'm putting you down.

7
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,830
- You're so good!
- Dad, I can do this now.

8
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,970
- Can you do this too, Dad?
- Should I try it?

9
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,700
This?

10
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,170
What kinds of sounds did you
record on Jeju Island?

11
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,700
The sound of the waves, wind,
and people. Everything.

12
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,890
- Dad, do you like sounds?
- Yes.

13
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,700
Why?

14
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,590
- Because they disappear.
- Do you like things that disappear?

15
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,750
Once you acknowledge that
things are transient...

16
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,850
you don't waste your energy
on useless things.

17
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,650
From here to over there.
Let's see who can get there faster.

18
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,480
- Ready. Set. Go!
- Hey, that's foul play.

19
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,420
That's a foul. No!

20
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,730
Now in reverse.

21
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,760
How could you kiss me like that
and not even call me?

22
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,100
That son of a bitch. That bastard.

23
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,390
I'm not going to call him.

24
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,980
No matter what, I'm not going to
call him first this time.

25
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,540
Mom! Is this all the laundry you have?

26
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,620
Just give her something.

27
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,540
You just couldn't put it down
nicely for me.

28
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,650
If he doesn't call me
by today, that's it!

29
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,820
I'm going to end it for real!

30
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,460
Hey.

31
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,100
It's nice out.
Let's get something to eat.

32
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,600
I don't want to waste a single day.
Being in jail has taught me some things.

33
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,540
Come. Are you busy?

34
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,230
- I just have some things to get done.
- What is it?

35
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,890
I need to do laundry.

36
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,630
Never mind. I've got it.
I'll see you later.

37
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,530
Okay.

38
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,410
Who is it?

39
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,860
Because of whom are you acting this way?

40
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,800
Is it because of Tae Jin
or the guy next door?

41
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,690
Is it Tae Jin or the guy next door?

42
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,280
I need to go out.

43
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,890
Mom, please wring them out
and hang them up to dry.

44
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,390
I won't accept either of them!

45
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,070
I'm going to kill you
if you date either one of them!

46
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,500
Mr. Park Do Kyung isn't
picking up his phone either.

47
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
Please give me his address.

48
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,500
Here you go.

49
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,800
I thought something had happened to you.

50
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
Why didn't you come in today?

51
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm not your doctor starting today.
I'm just a friend from the neighborhood.

52
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,900
I live around here.
I can talk with ease, right?

53
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,100
Sure. Go right ahead.

54
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,800
I've been thinking all night long
about how I should explain this to you.

55
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,270
Listen carefully.

56
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,570
You are in a car accident,
and you're lying on the road right now.

57
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,220
Is it confusing
because I said "right now"?

58
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,980
I understand. It must be.

59
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,010
You think time passes in the order of
past, present, and future, right?

60
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,890
That's not true.

61
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,690
If you hypnotize a 30-year-old person
and take him back in time by 100 years

62
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,100
a different voice comes out of him.
It means he's in a different life.

63
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,410
This works in reverse too.

64
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,820
If you take him forward
in time by 100 years

65
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,580
a different voice comes out of him.

66
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,500
So what does this mean?

67
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,290
It means your mind
isn't constrained by time.

68
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,110
Only your body is constrained by time.

69
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,900
Your mind knows
the complete story of your life.

70
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,540
To your mind, life is like
a completed scenario.

71
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,390
Do I seem crazy?

72
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,450
If I do, tell me. I'll stop.

73
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,300
It's interesting. Keep going.

74
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,200
I've been dying to talk about this.
But I feared I would be seen as a weirdo.

75
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,510
Listen to me carefully.

76
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,070
Spiritually enlightened people
are sensitive to their minds.

77
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,810
But you're not necessarily spiritually
enlightened. You're a special case.

78
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,290
You can't foresee
everything from the future

79
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,200
but you see very particular episodes.

80
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,150
About one woman.

81
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,800
Right now, you're in a car accident

82
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,970
and you're missing that woman
before your death.

83
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,510
I'm confusing you again
with the term "right now," right?

84
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,730
All right. Let's say "soon."

85
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,630
Although the mind
isn't constrained by time

86
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,970
we see things from
our bodies' perspective.

87
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,740
To make it easier, let's say "soon."

88
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,830
You'll soon be in a car accident

89
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,820
and you're going to miss that woman

90
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,340
as you stare into the night sky.

91
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,610
Because your feelings
for her are so strong

92
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,150
you started seeing visions of her
even before you met her in real life.

93
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,290
Why?

94
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,510
Because our mind knows everything
about our life stories.

95
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,800
It's not very hard for
our minds to do this.

96
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,500
So in conclusion...

97
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm going to die soon

98
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,290
and I'm going to miss that woman
while I'm dying?

99
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,880
You're a weirdo, right?

100
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,690
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can make it today.

101
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,650
Something urgent came up at work.

102
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,980
No. I think it'll take a long time.

103
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,410
Yeah. I'm sorry.

104
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,020
See you.

105
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,710
Do Kyung.
Let's try to get through this together.

106
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,360
There could be a different conclusion!

107
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,060
Do Kyung!

108
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,780
<i>So in conclusion...</i>

109
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,990
<i>I'm going to die soon</i>

110
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,280
<i>and I'm going to miss that woman
while I'm dying?</i>

111
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,170
Aren't you coming?

112
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,190
I'm not coming.
(In French)

113
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,930
Aren't you coming home?

114
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,510
How long are you going to
get drunk like this?

115
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,780
My life is too embarrassing...

116
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,920
for me to live in my sober state.

117
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,480
<i>Congratulations.</i>

118
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,340
<i>And celebration.</i>

119
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,250
<i>Congratulations to Soo Kyung.</i>

120
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,100
<i>Congratulation--</i>

121
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,030
Am I getting married?

122
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,700
How did you know?

123
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,400
This guy I know wants to marry you!

124
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,380
You want to die, don't you?

125
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,720
Hear me out.

126
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,840
His ideal type is a strong woman!

127
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,850
A woman who hits, scratches,
grills, and kicks him.

128
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,510
Apparently he goes crazy
over a woman like this.

129
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,730
And importantly, he sleeps sitting down.

130
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,590
Isn't that great?

131
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,180
He owns a 52 peyong-sized apartment

132
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,880
and has an annual salary
of 220 million won.

133
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,090
Both of his parents are deceased

134
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,530
and he has no older or younger sisters.

135
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,340
According to himself,
he's a great-looking man.

136
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,080
Just go with the flow and get married.

137
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,750
He said you just need to
bring a spoon.

138
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,820
Seeing the perfect man for you
put me in such a great mood today.

139
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,350
So I had something to drink.

140
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,040
You crazy bastard!

141
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,370
Am I a man to you?
Talking to me while peeing...

142
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,570
Even if you don't see me as a woman...

143
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,640
What? What did I do?

144
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,650
You shouldn't do this to me.

145
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,020
I'm a woman too! I'm a woman!

146
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,100
I guess you're a woman too.

147
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,340
She's being shy.

148
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,070
I was just saying she should go
with the flow and get married.

149
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,340
<i>Congratulations. And celebration.</i>

150
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,100
<i>Soo Kyung is finally getting married.</i>

151
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,750
Oh my god. He kissed you on the street?

152
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,790
He has exploded. He must like you a lot!

153
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,500
But he hasn't called me since.

154
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,710
Just wait. He'll call you.

155
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,440
After getting burned by Oh Hae Young,
he's with another Oh Hae Young.

156
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,700
Based on his boring personality,
he probably can't accept that easily.

157
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,190
- And you two even know each other.
- It's not even a big deal.

158
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,150
You hesitated at first too
because he dated Oh Hae Young.

159
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,210
He likes you for sure

160
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,710
but I think he needs some time
to gather his thoughts before

161
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,700
he can be with you in front of everyone.

162
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,200
And he doesn't seem like the type
to date you in secret or something.

163
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,840
How does he hold himself back?

164
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,420
I can't. Not even for a single day.

165
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,280
The longing...

166
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,980
How does he hold that back?

167
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,070
Just wait.
Don't barge in and push him away.

168
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,360
You need to give him some time to
gather his thoughts and make a decision.

169
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,440
Listen to your big sis.

170
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,460
He has fallen for you.
He'll come to you soon.

171
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,200
Why are you holding back?

172
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,150
How is it possible for you to hold back?

173
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,650
If you like me, you like me.
Why are you being so cautious?

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,290
<i>Right now, you're in a car accident</i>

175
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,680
<i>and you're missing that woman
before your death.</i>

176
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,300
<i>Are you okay?</i>

177
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,500
<i>Hey. Don't touch him!</i>

178
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,100
Where are you?

179
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,140
Park Hoon!

180
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,340
- Wait. Hold on.
- Are you okay?

181
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,590
I've missed you.

182
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,000
Me too.

183
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,210
Should we just live together
starting today?

184
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,960
You're so scared.

185
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,150
Thank you. Have a nice day.

186
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,590
I'm so happy that you're my boyfriend.
Beyond happy!

187
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,300
If you date other women,
I'm going to kill you.

188
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,380
- Do you like it that much?
- Yeah.

189
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,010
It has an amazing ending.

190
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,550
After he has killed everyone

191
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,490
he finds his bottle opener,
all covered in blood.

192
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,400
He then opens a bottle of beer
with that bottle opener and drinks it.

193
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,090
I could present it to
a producer right now, right?

194
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,620
Right now. Show it to them right now.

195
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,540
This is going to hit big.

196
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,400
There's a producer who
works with new directors.

197
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,500
I worked as a sound producer for
that person's movie not too long ago.

198
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,170
As soon as she approves this,
I'll instantly become a famous director.

199
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,980
It's a woman?

200
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,810
Half of the world's population
is women. But you're my only woman.

201
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Didn't you say your mom is a producer?

202
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,380
- Why won't you work with your mom?
- My mom?

203
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,720
- Nah. That won't work.
- Why?

204
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,610
- Just because.
- What do you mean?

205
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,100
- Hello.
- Welcome.

206
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,920
Because of my neck disc pain

207
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,940
I can't even play golf
in this beautiful weather.

208
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,200
- Just doing this here...
- Good shot!

209
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,560
- Let's go.
- Okay.

210
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,890
He's a master in flattery.

211
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,720
I was going to fire him next month.

212
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,050
But I should just fire him this month.

213
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,650
- Let's play a game today.
- Sure. I would love that.

214
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,290
If AlphaGo and I play a game of omok,
who do you think will win?

215
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,740
AlphaGo would win for sure.

216
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
- How about a flicking game?
- AlphaGo.

217
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,020
What type of game
could I win against him?

218
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,520
Why even bother?
Just buy one and use it for yourself.

219
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,270
That works. This is why I like you.

220
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,830
I like you...

221
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,420
But I heard you almost
got married to Do Kyung?

222
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,500
Is this true?

223
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,910
Why did you guys break up?

224
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,070
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

225
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,820
That's not what's important.

226
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,330
If I get married to Do Kyung's mother

227
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,790
that means my past stepdaughter
and a future stepson had a thing.

228
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,180
Although you two are not blood-related...

229
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,110
You know how the gossipers are.
They make up lies and let them circulate.

230
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,430
Do Kyung's mother was adamant
that you two were done.

231
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,560
Is it over between you two? For sure?

232
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,780
<i>I'm okay now.</i>

233
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,800
If I see you on the streets,
I can now smile and happily greet you.

234
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,290
Anything more than this would be weird.
It would be right to end things here.

235
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,220
You two aren't over yet. Am I right?

236
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,930
It is over.

237
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,650
But I still like him.

238
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,000
<i>I thought it would be over
once my scars had been healed.</i>

239
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,190
<i>I thought I would be able
to go my own way</i>

240
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,080

241
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,110
<i>I feel like throwing up.</i>

242
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,590
Listening to the high-pitched voice
of an actress for a month.

243
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,400
Whenever I have to work with actors
with annoying voices

244
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,870
it's a pain until
I'm done with that movie.

245
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,200
It must be.

246
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,410
Please let my ears rest with your voice.

247
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,150
There was a man named Park Do Kyung.

248
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,050
Out of all the voices in the world

249
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,510
he liked Oh Hae Young's the most.

250
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,240
Whenever he heard Hae Young's voice

251
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,910
he slowly fell asleep.

252
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
He loved her so much.

253
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,580
Very passionately.

254
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,690
<i>[Passionate Bottle Opener]</i>

255
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,820
I'll take my time and look through it.

256
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,610
But I think we should change the title.

257
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,820
It sounds so low-class.

258
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,920
Yes. But if you read the scenario,
you'll see how fitting it is.

259
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,020
It's about men's fight over pride,
caused by a single bottle opener.

260
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,470
The pettiness of men. Noir of men.

261
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,310
The pettiness of men. Noir of men.
Sounds fun.

262
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,840
Sure. It'll be really good.

263
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,200

264
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,620
please keep this a secret.

265
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,510
By the way,
what is Director Park doing nowadays?

266
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,330
He's the same as always.
Being temperamental and fussy.

267
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,660
You're coming to
CEO Jang's 70th birthday, right?

268
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,150
- Why would I go?
- What do you mean?

269
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,230
You've used him when you needed him.
Now you won't go to his birthday party?

270
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,150
I heard he did you a favor.

271
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,450
I heard he helped you
ruin someone's business.

272
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,500
He has a relationship with your mother.
How could you not go?

273
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,220
Don't just give him
one or two million won.

274
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,590
Bring him something nice and rare.
Not some common brand product.

275
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,280
So that I'm not embarrassed. Okay?

276
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,660
Excuse me.

277
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,450
Are you done with the recording?

278
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,000
It's almost finished.

279
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,400
I swear.

280
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,580
I think he's going to introduce me
to his people at this party.

281
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,480
- As his fiancée.
- Isn't this enough?

282
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,070
- Two marriages weren't enough for you?
- What's wrong with you?

283
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,900
This isn't just for my sake.

284
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,730
You could have a rich man
as your father.

285
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,670
Am I a little boy?
Why do I need a father at my age?

286
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,360
Other people would kill to
have him on their side.

287
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,150
You should be grateful.

288
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,050
You can just come home with your family
and live a normal life now.

289
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,910
You're at that age now.

290
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,930
That old man will constantly have
women problems--

291
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,790
What if I'm dirt poor when I'm old?
Are you going to take care of me?

292
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,440
How much could you give me every month?

293
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,110
You bastard.

294
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,890
His "women problem" is all a rumor.

295
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,640
He didn't see any other woman
once we started dating!

296
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

297
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,130
I didn't know it was you.

298
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,110
So what if it was someone else?
It would have been okay to hit him?

299
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,950
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry!

300
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,810

Sure.

303

This is ridiculous.

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,070

- Oh my. Hi.

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,760
Long time no see.

310
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,980
He told me to keep this
a secret from you.

311
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,690
- Can't you just forget you saw anything?
- Is it that bad?

312
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,490
You can't expect much
from new directors.

313
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,200
This just sounds like Hoon.

314
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,500
You were reading it with contempt.

315
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,660
I wasn't reading it with contempt.
But you must know too.

316
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,550
His level of writing.

317

I feel a little offended.

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,290
I'm reading it for him

How many years have you

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,820
Do Kyung, but still...

344
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,520
If you learn some skills from me,
you'll be able to make a living.

345
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,880
And you won't get belittled.

346
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,530
- I still want to give it a shot!
- Your writing is embarrassing!

347
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,310
You can't do anything with this.
It's embarrassing.

348
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,380
So get a hold of yourself.

349
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,300
How could you say that to your brother?

350
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,830
Scripts that are worse than mine are
produced into movies just fine.

351
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,730
People come watch them too.

352
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,260
What did you say? Embarrassing?

353
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,690
Life itself is shameful! You know?

354
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,900
Being alive is shameful.

355
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,620
Eating is shameful too.

356
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,670
And it's shameful to hear
that I'm an embarrassment.

357
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,480
What's so wrong with being embarrassed?
Embarrassment isn't a death sentence.

358
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,040
You can't stand being embarrassed, right?
You just can't, right?

359
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,590
I won't die from embarrassment.
That's why I'm a winner. You know?

360
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,210
I'm going to get pushed around by people.
Listen to them criticize my writing.

361
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,030
And live with embarrassment!
So just let me be!

362
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,190
I can't watch you
get belittled by people!

363
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:56,070
So just quickly learn how to
produce sound from me.

364
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,450
Do Kyung.

365
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,910
You think people respect you, right?

366
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,570
No. They badmouth you.

367
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,060
What's the point of being that proud?

368
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,930
You only live once. So let me do
whatever I want to with my life!

369
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
What's the matter?

370
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,090
What is it?

371
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,260
Aren't you going to tell me?

372
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,170
My brother said
my scenario was embarrassing.

373
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,090
Let's kill him, Park Do Kyung.

374
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,480
That son of a bitch thinks
he's so much better.

375
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,090
I will kill him.

376
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,070
Hey, hey!

377
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,110
- Hey!
- Don't stop me!

378
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,000
I will kill him.

379
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,860
Let me go!

380
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,750
Damn Park Do Kyung!

381
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,650
It's so frustrating.

382
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,650
Park Do Kyung is so irritating.

383
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,480
<i>You think people respect you, right?</i>

384
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,890
They all badmouth you.

385
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,200
What's the point of being that proud?

386
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,910
Do you like things that disappear?

387
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,100
Once you acknowledge that
things are transient

388
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,310
you don't waste your energy
on useless things.

389
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,990
Dad!

390
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,890
Dad! Dad!

391
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,370
Dad!

392
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,600
- Dad!
- Yes.

393
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,600
- Dad.
- Yes?

394
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,470
What sounds did you get from DMZ?

395
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,450
Well...

396
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,140
The sound that soldiers make when doing
a routine check around the wire fence.

397
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,950
And the announcement from North Korea.

398
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,060
And the bird sounds.

399
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,240
What sound do you like the most, Dad?

400
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,680
Well, for me...

401
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,160
I like your voice the most.

402
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,370
It's Children's Day tomorrow.

403
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,200
Are we going anywhere?

404
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,700
- Where shall we go?
- Well...

405
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,390
You can't stand your wife

406
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,280
but you still like to see your kids, huh?

407
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,120
You're bothered to stop
by the house occasionally.

408
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,100
Gosh, if it weren't for
your job acquiring sounds

409
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,430
I wonder what other excuse you
would come up with not to come home.

410
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,240
You chose the right career.

411
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,950
Don't you think?

412
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,180
- Do Kyung, hurry up.
- I'm coming.

413
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,370
- Dad!
- Do Kyung, it's dangerous.

414
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,580
- Play on this side.
- I will.

415
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,300
Dad.

416
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,260
Is there a sound
when a butterfly flutters its wings?

417
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,080
Why don't you listen for it?

418
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,830
- It doesn't make any sound.
- Listen carefully.

419
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,390
Dad.

420
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,330
Dad.

421
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,260
Dad.

422
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,080
Dad!

423
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,870
Dad!

424
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,410
Dad! Dad!

425
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,410
Wake up!

426
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,640
Dad, wake up!

427
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,680
Dad.

428
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,300
I can't walk any farther.

429
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,450
Wake up now.

430
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,890
Once you acknowledge that
things are transient

431
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,310
you don't waste your energy
on useless things.

432
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,740
Why did you leave without asking me?

433
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,930
Why?

434
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:14,180
I will never leave ever!

435
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,990
<i>[The Guy Next Door]</i>

436
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,010
I was going to wait
five rings before I answered it.

437
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,390
I ended up answering after three rings.

438
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,990
I'm just too easy. Don't you think?

439
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,080
If you've called, you should talk.

440
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,850
Why aren't you saying anything?

441
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,280
Are you still testing the waters?

442
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,720
Come here.

443
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,970
You think I'm so easy that
I'd come if you ask me?

444
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,200
I miss you.

445
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,120
I miss you.

446
00:50:55,990 --> 00:51:00,950
I'm so easy that I'd come if you ask me.

447
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,220
Now.

448
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,490
What else do you want me to do?

449
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,680
Can you give me a hug?

450
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,430
How come you don't ask
where we're going?

451
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,220
It doesn't matter where we're going.

452
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,350
Because I'm easy.

453
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,100
I'm glad you're easy.

454
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,700
Do you know how hard it is
for a woman to decide to be easy?

455
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,800
If you have a change of heart

456
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,530
I will kill you.

457
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,370
How come you're not answering?

458
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,890
You're planning on having
a change of heart again, huh?

459
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,970
I won't have a change of heart.

460
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,850
Yeah!

461
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,830
I'm loving this!

462
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,450
Ah, it's cold!

463
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,450
When did you start liking me?

464
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,450
Do you want me to guess?

465
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,660
When you first met me.

466
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,490
- No.
- Then when?

467
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:24,300
When you said you voted for yourself
in the election for class president.

468
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,390
What? Why? It's so embarrassing.

469
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,600
You had the courage
to admit it was embarrassing.

470
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,760
I liked it.

471
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,830
So random.

472
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,200
I have so many embarrassing stories.

473
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,990
Do you want to hear more?

474
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,600
Well...

475
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,800
I got 20 out of 100 on my first
spelling test in elementary school.

476
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,780
And...

477
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,200
In my freshmen year at college

478
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,200
on the way to a school trip,
I had to stop the bus for a bathroom.

479
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,640
Gosh, that was so embarrassing.

480
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,390
Well, I've fallen out of a bus once.

481
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,970
You know how high
the last seats get on the bus.

482
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,830
I was dozing off in
the last seat by the window.

483
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,470
I fell out of the bus,
but what's amazing was

484
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,890
I wasn't hurt at all.

485
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:11,240
I was so embarrassed
that I ran to get away.

486
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,510
Thanks.

487
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,850
Wow, you will drink tonight?

488
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,760
Ouch. Hot.

489
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,620
- Give it. I will do it.
- It's okay. It will go away.

490
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,350
What if I say it hurts right here?

491
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,850
What would you do
if I ask you to blow on my booboo?

492
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,580
I would kill you.

493
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,870
I knew you'd say that.

494
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,700
What if I ask you to feed me saying "Ah"?

495
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,620
No, I won't do that.
So no worries and drink up.

496
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,100
Don't cut it. Eat it as a whole piece.

497
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,560
Wow, it's so juicy. Try.

498
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,490
No, just eat it without any sauce.

499
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,530
It's tastier that way.

500
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,600
It's good, right?

501
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,350
The time when we had
pork belly with your parents.

502
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:17,200
Yes?

503
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,100
- It was nice.
- What?

504
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,350
After you rejected me so hard...

505
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,100
Was it fun to see
my parents put on an act?

506
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,530
Your mom said...

507
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,700
I wanted to thank you
for the security bar last time.

508
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,490
I've been wanting to treat you.

509
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,200
It took us this long. Have some.

510
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,910
She put the meat on my rice.

511
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,990
Why were you touched by such a thing?

512
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,870
It was nothing.

513
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,100
Just say the word.

514
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,680
I will put meat or kimchi
on your rice at every meal.

515
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,160
Go ahead.

516
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,800
I will spend all night
putting these on your plate.

517
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,620
This may be too big.

518
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,390
Hello, miss.
(in French)

519
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:23,630
You've come home early today.

520
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,260
Wow, off to a hot date?

521
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,990
My dress code for tonight is...

522
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:50,350
Rooftop party.

523
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:56,380
Rooftop party, hey!

524
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,990
You know what it is, right?
In Korean, it's a rooftop party.

525
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,200
All the hot ladies
show up there these days.

526
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,530
See you later.

527
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,410
Rooftop party.

528
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:24,300
Rooftop party!

529
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,410
Rooftop party!

530
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,100
- See you.
- See you.

531
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:35,990
Damn.
(in French)

532
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,260
It's farther back there.

533
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,930
- Hurry.
- We will be late.

534
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,200
- Shall we go?
- We've just finished our shift.

535
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,140
We're serious.

536
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,280
Gosh, you're the lady without a face...

537
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,220
Let's go, shall we?

538
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,490
Let's go.

539
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,640
Please slow down.

540
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,180
- Did you have dinner yet?
- Pardon?

541
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:23,180
I am... proud of you guys.

542
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,600
Ladies of the neighborhood.

543
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,280
Juice.

544
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,030
Have a seat.

545
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,970
We're really okay.

546
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,430
You've escorted me home safely.

547
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,890
I can't just let you leave.

548
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,780
Please.

549
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,350
We're really okay.

550
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,220
I said please have a seat.

551
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,740
Take your time and enjoy.

552
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,800
Can I ask you something?

553
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:34,010
How many men have you slept with?

554
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,030
Well, back in our days...

555
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,370
I am... 44 years old.

556
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,890
The number of men I've slept with is...

557
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,240
Two and a half...

558
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,510
I'm guessing you've slept with
more men than I have, huh?

559
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,300
Once I sleep with a man

560
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,200
I fall in love with him.

561
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,800
It's not that I sleep with him
after I fall in love with him.

562
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,470
Once I sleep with someone...

563
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,990
I fall in love with that person.

564
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,850
But...

565
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:42,930
Why in the world did it
happen to be that loser?

566
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:53,490
Everybody says I'm cool and chic and all.

567
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:58,890
But I don't know how to be any of those.

568
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,200
Once I sleep with someone

569
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,100
shouldn't I start
a relationship with him?

570
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:11,490
Out of all these bodies
that inhabit this vast universe

571
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,800
and take into account the chances
that two bodies would collide

572
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:20,100
wouldn't that mean those two bodies
are destined to be together forever?

573
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,200
But...

574
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,890
why in the world does
he have to be this loser...

575
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:33,810
who sleeps with
different women every night?

576
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,490
Why? Impossible!

577
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:40,450
Why that bastard?! Why?

578
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,970
Get out.

579
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,030
Get out. Get out!

580
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,800
It's that way, not that way.

581
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,930
Get out. Get out. Get out!

582
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,780
Get out!

583
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:10,890
Ever since I first met that bastard
at the age of six

584
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,830
I knew right away
what a bastard he was.

585
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:20,390
I was chasing him around
calling him brother all week.

586
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:25,510
Do you know what he said after a week?

587
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,910
You go back to your home.

588
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,510
But I'm still living
in the same house now.

589
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,800
You two have the same last name.
Aren't you two biological brothers?

590
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,010
Come on. Those with the same
last name are all siblings, then?

591
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,100
In order not to show
that we have different fathers

592
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:53,990
my mom must have tried to marry
a man with the same last name.

593
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,870
Let's live together.

594
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,180
If I tell my brother I'll live with you

595
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,950
he'll go crazy on me.

596
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,580
I was debating what I should say...

597
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,950
But I don't care about him anymore.

598
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,950
He's not really my brother, either.

599
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,680
I have the guts now.

600
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,220
I won't live in that house anymore.

601
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,390
I wanted to kill that man earlier.

602
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,700
Now I want to give him a hug.

603
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,300
Whom do you want to give a hug?

604
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,390
- Mr. Park.
- Why him?

605
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,220
I wanted to kill him when I thought
he was your real brother.

606
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,890
Now that you two
are not really related...

607
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,720
it feels as if he really loves you.

608
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,120
I want to give him a hug to thank him.

609
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,370
Seriously! What have you heard until now?

610
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:50,030
He's such a son of a bitch.

611
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,140
Oh no.

612
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,830
It's a good thing you're my boyfriend.

613
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,300
I'm glad that you are in my arms.

614
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,200
If you were with some other woman,
I'd be very sad for you.

615
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,430
Go away. Now we're even.

616
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,720
- Come on.
- Go away. I don't like that.

617
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,560
- Come on.
- Ah! Stop it.

618
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,180
You seem very drunk.

619
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,030
Shall we go in someplace?

620
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,180
I already called for a driver.

621
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,550
What?

622
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,120
Wait a second. Wow.

623
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,990
Wow. I'm totally sober now.

624
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,490
How can you possibly
call for a driver now?

625
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:46,510
Does it make sense to call for
a driver at a time like this?

626
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:48,100
Why not?

627
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,950
No, I mean... think about it.

628
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,910
Huh? Think about it.

629
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:59,080
From here to Seoul, it will cost
us about 200,000 won at least.

630
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,450
- It's 300,000.
- 300,000?

631
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,850
It's 300,000, not 30,000?

632
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,870
Like you can find money when you
dig a hole in the ground, huh?

633
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,990
I'm so baffled that I can't even talk.

634
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,240
Why don't you ask for a discount then?

635
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,180
Right now...

636
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,970
that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

637
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,390
Well, when we're this good like now

638
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:24,260
we came to the shore and had a drink.

639
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,990
We kissed, hugged, and did other things.

640
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,430
Does it make sense that
you called for a driver now?

641
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,530
Are you asking me to drive then?

642
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:38,800
Is it Hongik University or Gangnam here?

643
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,180
Where can you possibly
find a driver here?

644
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,050
Hello, did you call for a driver?

645
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,310
- You're going to Seoul, right?
- Yes.

646
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,620
- Can I have the key?
- Sure.

647
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,370
Hold on.

648
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:55,350
Isn't 300,000 a bit too much?

649
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,760
With that amount, you know...

650
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:03,430
I will drive you for 200,000.

651
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,080
I was going back to Seoul anyway.

652
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,160
Or 180,000?

653
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,910
Fine. 150,000 then.

654
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,910
Let's go for 150,000, shall we?

655
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:19,030
I need to make something too.

656
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,260
<i>[Come in to rest. Last motel]</i>

657
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,100
Women shouldn't sleep at motels.

658
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,330
If that's true

659
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:14,100
only men go to all these motels
by themselves then?

660
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,620
That's enough.

661
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,600
You're being so picky.

662
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,610
When the woman tries to be easy...

663
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:26,660
Let's have our first night together
at a nice place next time.

664
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,770
When will it be?

665
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,400
<i>Let's go.</i>

666
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,680
<i>Let's go all the way.</i>

667
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,380
<i>[Many thanks to Lee Pil Mo
and Lee Yu Ri.]</i>
