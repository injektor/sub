00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,890
<font color="yellow"><i>As June passed by,
we didn't set foot outside the house.</i></font>

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,030
<font color="yellow"><i>The moment I could believe
everything he had said</i></font>

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,290
<font color="yellow"><i>I strangely felt at ease.</i></font>

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,620
<font color="yellow"><i>It felt like I had actually touched
destiny with my own hands.</i></font>

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,010
<font color="yellow"><i>The fact that this world
I didn't know of exists.</i></font>

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,120
<font color="yellow"><i>The fact that this world
I can see isn't everything.</i></font>

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,900
<font color="yellow"><i>It felt strange and unfamiliar.</i></font>

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
<font color="yellow"><i>But it strangely felt
comforting and calming.</i></font>

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,970
<font color="yellow"><i>On an early spring day...</i></font>

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,100
<font color="yellow"><i>You, who have come to me like a dream...</i></font>

13
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,270
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought it would last forever.</i></font>

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,160
<font color="yellow">Let's listen to this song
until we turn 100.</font>

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,870
<font color="yellow"><i>The summer beach.</i></font>

16
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,090
<font color="yellow"><i>The sand castle full of happiness.</i></font>

17
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,090
<font color="yellow">Are you embarrassed?</font>

18
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,010
<font color="yellow"><i>It got washed away with the waves.</i></font>

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,220
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't have any
singing skills to brag about.</i></font>

20
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,680
<font color="yellow"><i>But my sensibility is
worth bragging about.</i></font>

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,190
<font color="yellow"><i>So I'm more suited for small concerts.</i></font>

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,280
<font color="yellow"><i>Wow. You're so modest.</i></font>

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Please say a word to our viewers.</i></font>

24
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,560
<font color="yellow"><i>What should I say?</i></font>

25
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,570
<font color="yellow"><i>I live because of you guys. Thank you.</i></font>

26

did we go outside.</i></font>

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
<font color="yellow">So this is her.</font>

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,100
<font color="yellow">The person you've been
seeing in your visions.</font>

30
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,600
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,250
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Soon Taek.</font>

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,160
<font color="yellow">It's all true.</font>

33
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,770
<font color="yellow">Seeing into the future is possible</font>

34
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,000
<font color="yellow">but that doesn't mean
all of your visions come true.</font>

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,460
<font color="yellow">It may follow the vision
or it may take a very different path.</font>

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,030
<font color="yellow">An event can cause the vision to change.</font>

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,920
<font color="yellow">- Do you still have visions?
- No.</font>

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,990
<font color="yellow">I don't get any visions anymore.</font>

39
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,400
<font color="yellow">So it's all over then, right?</font>

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,220
<font color="yellow">As long as he's alive,
we can't say anything is over yet.</font>

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,680
<font color="yellow">- Don't be so vague about it.
- How am I being vague?</font>

42
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,590
<font color="yellow">So we don't have to...</font>

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,440
<font color="yellow">worry about him dying
or anything like that, right?</font>

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,560
<font color="yellow">I mean, everyone will die one day.
He's not a phoenix.</font>

45
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,650
<font color="yellow">Just saying...</font>

46
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,490
<font color="yellow">Let's live together.
I can't leave you by yourself.</font>

47
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,010
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad thinking about how
you'd have lived in fear by yourself.</font>

48
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,220
<font color="yellow">- Let's live together.
- I never lived in fear.</font>

49
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,930
<font color="yellow">I wasn't scared.</font>

50
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,470
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful to you for liking me first.
But don't say those kinds of words first.</font>

51
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,000
<font color="yellow">I'll propose to you.</font>

52
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,300
<font color="yellow">Carefully. Be careful. Hold on.
Hey, Park Hoon!</font>

53
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,310
<font color="yellow">- Is this the last one?
- Yeah. Help us.</font>

54
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,420
<font color="yellow">- Hold on.
- It's heavy. Help us.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Do Kyung]</i></font>

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,190
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? Grab it!
- You bastard!</font>

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,020
<font color="yellow">Hey. We're done.</font>

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,860
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

59
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,530
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me. Here. Here.
- Our studio is released from seizure.</font>

60
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,820
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- It is?</font>

61
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,080
<font color="yellow">For real?</font>

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,180
<font color="yellow">Move everything out again.</font>

63
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,920
<font color="yellow">He could have told us earlier.
We moved everything.</font>

64
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,690
<font color="yellow">My hand is shaking. Look at this.</font>

65
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,060
<font color="yellow">This is the first time my hand is
shaking from fatigue.</font>

66
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,750
<font color="yellow">Park Do Kyung. That bastard.</font>

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,170
<font color="yellow">He's hiding somewhere and watching us.</font>

68
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,410
<font color="yellow">Now that we finished moving everything,
he figured now is the time to tell us!</font>

69
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,720
<font color="yellow">Maybe he's looking at us with
a telescope. He is. For sure.</font>

70
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,660
<font color="yellow">- He's so sick.
- Should I bring everything back out?</font>

71
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,690
<font color="yellow">- Hire someone to do it!
- You're that someone.</font>

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,010
<font color="yellow"><i>You've done nothing wrong.
Live with ease.</i></font>

73
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,230
<font color="yellow"><i>And don't go anywhere near CEO Jang.</i></font>

74
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,550
<font color="yellow">The 800 million won that you spent
buying bonds was wasted.</font>

75
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,280
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

76
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,010
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do business either.
You won't make it.</font>

77
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,860
<font color="yellow">Those incompetent people
with talkative mouths.</font>

78
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,970
<font color="yellow">- Get out of my way!
- You can't be like this.</font>

79
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,450
<font color="yellow">- Don't you know who I am?
- Ma'am, you can't get in.</font>

80
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,730
<font color="yellow">- Get out of my way!
- You can't. Please.</font>

81
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,480
<font color="yellow">- You can't do this, ma'am.
- Get out of my way!</font>

82
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,810
<font color="yellow">- These kids...
- You can't be here! Ma'am!</font>

83
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,340
<font color="yellow">I heard that you were just
messing around with my Do Kyung!</font>

84
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,150
<font color="yellow">Why do you live like this?</font>

85
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,810
<font color="yellow">Hey! Get out of my way! Let go of me!</font>

86
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,860
<font color="yellow">Hey. Who cares if
you have a lot of money?</font>

87
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,460
<font color="yellow">You can't ever go outside!</font>

88
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,430
<font color="yellow">You're always playing
board games at home!</font>

89
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,360
<font color="yellow">And you encourage young
kids to fight against each other.</font>

90
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,840
<font color="yellow">Hey. You shouldn't mess with this bitch</font>

91
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,220
<font color="yellow">who has nothing to lose!</font>

92
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,130
<font color="yellow">If I see that you're about to
mess with Do Kyung again...</font>

93
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,670
<font color="yellow">Then I'll just...</font>

94
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,930
<font color="yellow">put this body of mine to use.
Either you or I will die!</font>

95
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,170
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! Let go!</font>

96
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,900
<font color="yellow">You're always so full of energy!</font>

97
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,250
<font color="yellow">- This is why I like you.
- Bullshit.</font>

98
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,210
<font color="yellow">What?
Are you trying to flatter me right now?</font>

99
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,400
<font color="yellow">You must be scared, eh?</font>

100
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,450
<font color="yellow">The day I come back here.</font>

101
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,600
<font color="yellow">You know what that day will be, right?</font>

102
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,150
<font color="yellow">- Don't make me come back here, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

103
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,260
<font color="yellow">If I had married her,
I wouldn't have survived a week. Right?</font>

104
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,060
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- I'm sorry, but could you get up?</font>

105
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,290
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

106
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,620
<font color="yellow"><i>[Yoga for Pregnancy]</i></font>

107
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,850

- I see. I'm sorry.</font>

108
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,250
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Sure.</font>

109
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,650
<font color="yellow">- Do you want me to carry your purse?
- It's okay.</font>

110
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,890
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

111
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,360
<font color="yellow">You heard that Do Kyung's studio
was released from seizure, right?</font>

112
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,550
<font color="yellow">- Yeah. I heard.
- You did. I see.</font>

113
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,250
<font color="yellow">You have pretty ankles.</font>

114
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,390
<font color="yellow">My other parts are pretty too.</font>

115
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,990
<font color="yellow">- The stars are shining so brightly.
- Yeah. They're so pretty.</font>

116
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,150
<font color="yellow">When did they redo these streets?</font>

117
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,990
<font color="yellow">It seems like they've
changed the wall too.</font>

118
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,820
<font color="yellow">- Jin Sang.
- Yes?</font>

119
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,890
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

120
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,250
<font color="yellow">Where should I grab?</font>

121
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,170
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

122
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,450
<font color="yellow">Just anywhere...</font>

123
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,580
<font color="yellow">- Over here?
- Sure.</font>

124
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,790
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

125
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,760
<font color="yellow">- It tickles.
- I'm sorry.</font>

126
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,820
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you tired?
- No. It's okay.</font>

127
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,620
<font color="yellow">This feels weird.</font>

128
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,240
<font color="yellow">I think we should...</font>

129
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,540
<font color="yellow">- let go of each other now...
- Sure. You're right.</font>

130
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,720
<font color="yellow">Let's let go on the count of three.
One, two, three.</font>

131
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,550
<font color="yellow">- Good night.
- Good night to you too.</font>

132

- Sure!</font>

134
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,970
<font color="yellow">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

135
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,040
<font color="yellow">What kind of feeling is this?
Why is this so hard?</font>

136
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

137
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,690
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

138
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,020
<font color="yellow">Good night! Go to sleep!</font>

139
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,750
<font color="yellow">Mom. I want to get married.</font>

140
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,610
<font color="yellow">I just want to live with him.</font>

141
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,160
<font color="yellow">I want to move into his house
and live with him.</font>

142
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,620
<font color="yellow">Go live with him. Get out.</font>

143
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:02,120
<font color="yellow">- Get up.
- Mom.</font>

144
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,910
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

145
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,480
<font color="yellow">You need to tell him!</font>

146
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,330
<font color="yellow">That you've given me your consent!</font>

147
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:14,050
<font color="yellow">If I tell him I just left home, he won't
live with me. He'll tell me to go back!</font>

148
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,530
<font color="yellow">Come with me and tell him.</font>

149
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,520
<font color="yellow">Tell him you've given your consent!</font>

150
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,840
<font color="yellow">I can't leave him by himself.</font>

151
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,630
<font color="yellow">Please come with me and tell him.</font>

152
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,040
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

153
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,650
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

154
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,490
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me.
- I'll carry this one.</font>

155
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,180
<font color="yellow">I've finally realized how I feel
about Soo Kyung today.</font>

156
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,590
<font color="yellow">I respect her.</font>

157
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,900
<font color="yellow">You feel respect toward
people like Admiral Yi Soon Shin.</font>

158
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,380
<font color="yellow">So it means I'm dating someone like him.</font>

159
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,830
<font color="yellow">Then what could I do
with Admiral Yi Soon Shin?</font>

160
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,000
<font color="yellow">Could I put my arms around his shoulder?
Or around his waist?</font>

161
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,060
<font color="yellow">Crazy bastard.
Still hasn't come to his senses.</font>

162
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,340
<font color="yellow">To a woman who wants to live together
without even getting married</font>

163
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,870
<font color="yellow">how could you say, "I'll propose.
I'll officially bring you home"?</font>

164
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,290
<font color="yellow">To a woman you want to embrace,
sleep with, and wake up with?</font>

165
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,040
<font color="yellow">Saying all these words you don't mean
and pretending like it's all for her?</font>

166
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,380
<font color="yellow">How many times do you need to come back
from death to come to your senses?</font>

167
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,900
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- Me!</font>

168
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,030
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?</font>

169
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,500
<font color="yellow">Don't get angry. With a smile.</font>

170
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,920
<font color="yellow">Like you mean it, okay?</font>

171
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,320
<font color="yellow">So that he doesn't feel bad.</font>

172
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,700
<font color="yellow">Please? With a smile.</font>

173
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,090
<font color="yellow">In my entire life...</font>

174
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,290
<font color="yellow">I'm seeing possibly the most
ridiculous side of you.</font>

175
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,430
<font color="yellow">- You're getting thrown away today.
- Don't say that.</font>

176
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
<font color="yellow"><i>[One Way Street. Do Not Enter.]</i></font>

177
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
<font color="yellow"><i>[One Way Street. Do Not Enter.]</i></font>

178
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,060
<font color="yellow">Hey. Look over here.</font>

179
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,510
<font color="yellow">Do Kyung!</font>

180
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,660
<font color="yellow">With a happier face. Nicely, okay?</font>

181
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,530
<font color="yellow">I would like to marry Hae Young.
Please give me your consent.</font>

182
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,630
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming to us first.</font>

183
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,200
<font color="yellow">We've given her our consent. Right?</font>

184
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
<font color="yellow">We have.</font>

185
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,600
<font color="yellow">Just live together from today on.</font>

186
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,170
<font color="yellow">You guys are so madly in love.</font>

187
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,870
<font color="yellow">It'll take too long to set
the date and get married.</font>

188
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,850
<font color="yellow">Live together from today on.
I mean it.</font>

189
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,250
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

190
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,160
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

191
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,040
<font color="yellow">I wish you happiness.</font>

192
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,450
<font color="yellow">Let's go back home.</font>

193
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,310
<font color="yellow">Sir, could you open the trunk?</font>

194
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,540
<font color="yellow">- We'll get going. You two should go.
- Bye.</font>

195
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,260
<font color="yellow">Get your car out of the way.</font>

196
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,410
<font color="yellow"><i>Please look at me. Mom...</i></font>

197
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,840
<font color="yellow">That guy must be ill.</font>

198
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,030
<font color="yellow">That's why we need to let her go.</font>

199
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,190
<font color="yellow">- I told you we should go somewhere nice.
- I like this place the most.</font>

200
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,580
<font color="yellow">While I was living over there</font>

201
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,350
<font color="yellow">I was so frustrated every single night.</font>

202
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,390
<font color="yellow">How could you not come over to my place</font>

203
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,500
<font color="yellow">when you knew very well
that I liked you?</font>

204
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,050
<font color="yellow">I thought, "Should I seduce him?"</font>

205
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,800
<font color="yellow">But it would have been extremely
embarrassing if I got rejected.</font>

206
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,870
<font color="yellow">I got very angry every night.</font>

207
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,160
<font color="yellow">And I thought</font>

208
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,000
<font color="yellow">"How could this guy fall asleep?"</font>

209
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,160
<font color="yellow">Do you really think I could have?</font>

210
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,420
<font color="yellow">When should we get married?</font>

211
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,480
<font color="yellow">Whenever.</font>

212
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,870
<font color="yellow">Let's get married soon.</font>

213
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,600
<font color="yellow"><i>[Three minutes ago]</i></font>

214
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,690
<font color="yellow">So how did...</font>

215
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,340
<font color="yellow"><i>My friend, I'm behind the couch.</i></font>

216
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,230
<font color="yellow"><i>Could you somehow let me quietly leave?</i></font>

217
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,180
<font color="yellow">- You have a message.
- Forget it. Just leave it.</font>

218
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,190
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?
<i>- It's me.</i></font>

219
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,190
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

220
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,910
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? We can just
tell her we're getting married</font>

221
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,590
<font color="yellow">- and that we have your parents' consent.
- Let's tell her tomorrow, please.</font>

222
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,140
<font color="yellow">We can officially tell her
tomorrow during the day.</font>

223
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,960
<font color="yellow">This isn't the right time.
It feels like we got caught.</font>

224
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,870
<font color="yellow">Let's pretend like
I'm going home right now</font>

225
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,350
<font color="yellow">and tell her tomorrow. Okay?</font>

226
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,280
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- You need to take your car key.</font>

227
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,710
<font color="yellow">My legs.</font>

228
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,700
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- It's late.</font>

229
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,030
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was about to go home right now.</font>

230
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,080
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
I was about to take her home.</font>

231
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,620
<font color="yellow">- Is Jin Sang here?
- No, he's not.</font>

232
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,920
<font color="yellow">But his shoes are here. Over there.</font>

233
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,330
<font color="yellow">Let's go for a walk.</font>

234
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,740
<font color="yellow">I have indigestion.</font>

235
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,190
<font color="yellow">It wasn't my fault.</font>

236
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,720
<font color="yellow">Hey, congrats. Congratulations.</font>

237
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,100
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

238
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,800
<font color="yellow">Starting from today... I mean,
starting from tomorrow</font>

239
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,270
<font color="yellow">they're going to do something.</font>

240
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,170
<font color="yellow">- Do what?
- They have consent.</font>

241
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,180
<font color="yellow">- For what?
- They're going to tell you tomorrow.</font>

242
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,100
<font color="yellow">But not today. Never.</font>

243
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare sneak into my room again.</font>

244
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't sneak in! I've been here
since our conversation!</font>

245
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,420
<font color="yellow">That doesn't mean I saw everything
from the very beginning...</font>

246
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,570
<font color="yellow">I did. I saw it.</font>

247
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,800
<font color="yellow">I saw everything from
the very beginning!</font>

248
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,160
<font color="yellow">They were spinning from over here.
Soo Kyung, they were spinning</font>

249
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,310
<font color="yellow">and they sat down. Stood back up.
They were laughing and everything!</font>

250
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,290
<font color="yellow">They were pecking like chickens! Wow.</font>

251
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,420
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I saw everything!
You just wait!</font>

252
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,760
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thanks for saving me.
I was sweating so much.</font>

253
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,270
<font color="yellow">I think I get it.</font>

254
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,180
<font color="yellow">If something like this happens again,
you need to reveal yourself quickly.</font>

255
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,390
<font color="yellow">If you wait longer,
it gets harder to get out of it.</font>

256
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,300
<font color="yellow">You need to reveal yourself
within three seconds. Okay?</font>

257
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,230
<font color="yellow">- Three seconds. Okay.
- Hold on. Jin Sang, stand right here.</font>

258
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,780
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's wrong.
Hold still. You could get hurt.</font>

259
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,660
<font color="yellow">Nice catch. Hold on.</font>

260
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,600
<font color="yellow">Take a few steps back. Stretch it out.</font>

261
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,490
<font color="yellow">Stop. Wait. Hold on.</font>

262
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,220
<font color="yellow">Hey, Soo Kyung. Ouch.</font>

263
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,400
<font color="yellow">- How nice. This is it.
- Soo Kyung, I don't think this is it.</font>

264
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,100
<font color="yellow">- This is nice.
- Soo Kyung, I think this is dangerous.</font>

265
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,430
<font color="yellow">- No, it's not.
- Soo Kyung.</font>

266
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,490
<font color="yellow">He's here.</font>

267
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,100
<font color="yellow">Espresso Con Panna.
Whipped cream made by hand.</font>

268
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,100
<font color="yellow">Not whipped by a machine.
And with one additional shot, right?</font>

269
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

270
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,590
<font color="yellow">You're so quick on the uptake.</font>

271
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,450
<font color="yellow">Hurry and come over. Quickly!</font>

272
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,940
<font color="yellow">Take those tissues off your face.
You look pitiful.</font>

273
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,340
<font color="yellow">There's still some left.</font>

274
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,850
<font color="yellow"><i>[Passionate Bottle Opener]</i>
I don't have time to read all of this.</font>

275
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,100
<font color="yellow">Explain it to me.</font>

276
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,740
<font color="yellow">Let's see if you have the ability
to impress people with words.</font>

277
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,290
<font color="yellow">Huh? In words...</font>

278
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,680
<font color="yellow">Then I'll explain it to you in words...</font>

279
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,980
<font color="yellow">There is this woman number three loved.</font>

280
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,860
<font color="yellow">But this hillbilly goes
abroad for the first time.</font>

281
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,740
<font color="yellow">To show people he was abroad</font>

282
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,180
<font color="yellow">he buys a bottle opener
shaped like the Eiffel Tower.</font>

283
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,460
<font color="yellow">One you can stick on the fridge.
So he gives it to that woman.</font>

284
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,590
<font color="yellow">But one day,
he goes over to number one's house</font>

285
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,650
<font color="yellow">and finds that bottle opener there.</font>

286
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,650
<font color="yellow">Number three was always loyal to him.</font>

287
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,910
<font color="yellow">The moment he sees the bottle opener
at number one's house...</font>

288
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,060
<font color="yellow">He is disturbed.</font>

289
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,510
<font color="yellow">It seems like it's about
betrayal and conspiracy</font>

290
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,270
<font color="yellow">but, in truth, it's about his quest
to claim the bottle opener back.</font>

291
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,100
<font color="yellow">It's a noir film featuring a pitiful man.</font>

292
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,000
<font color="yellow">Sounds fun. Let's do it.</font>

293
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,470
<font color="yellow">This kind of work requires energy.
And you seem to have a lot of it.</font>

294
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,580
<font color="yellow">Same with your girlfriend.</font>

295
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,100
<font color="yellow">Tell Producer Kim Hee Ran
that I've agreed to it.</font>

296
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,430
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim Hee Ran is
good at what she does.</font>

297
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You're a lifesaver.</font>

298
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,650
<font color="yellow">A savior? Who knows?
Maybe you'll be my lifesaver.</font>

299
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,480
<font color="yellow">- You're so awesome.
- I know.</font>

300
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,110
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

301
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,500
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

302
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,090
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

303
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,890
<font color="yellow">I'm planning on meeting with
his mother tomorrow. Are you available?</font>

304
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,240
<font color="yellow">I've thrown you away.</font>

305
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,730
<font color="yellow">Why would I care about
a girl I've thrown away?</font>

306
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,610
<font color="yellow">- But you wished us happiness yesterday.
- Didn't you ask me to?</font>

307
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,100
<font color="yellow">- Can't you be nicer?
- When were we ever sweet to each other?</font>

308
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,460
<font color="yellow">Be nice from now on.</font>

309
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,100
<font color="yellow"><i>Since I can't go back home anymore
and see you once we fight over the phone</i></font>

310
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,690
<font color="yellow">I feel bad if you talk like that.</font>

311
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,960
<font color="yellow">Did that guy drive you
to work in the morning or not?</font>

312
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,210
<font color="yellow">Of course he took me.</font>

313
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,100
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep calling him "that guy"?</font>

314
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,690
<font color="yellow"><i>Stop calling him that.</i></font>

315
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,950
<font color="yellow">- Then what am I supposed to call him?
- Call him son-in-law Park.</font>

316
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,410
<font color="yellow">Bullshit.</font>

317
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,550
<font color="yellow">Delete number two and three.
Then re-sync the first one.</font>

318
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,550
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

319
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,220
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i></font>

320
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,170
<font color="yellow">I'm your soon-to-be father-in-law.</font>

321
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,680
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes!</font>

322
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,740
<font color="yellow">Write this down.</font>

323
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,340
<font color="yellow">Please go ahead.</font>

324
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,980
<font color="yellow">- Milk vetch root.

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,420
<font color="yellow">The moment Oh Man Suk
walked into this place</font>

332
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,100
<font color="yellow">I told myself, "Okay! I'm going to
work on him for a week!"</font>

333
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,860
<font color="yellow">Just enough so that he doesn't
feel burdened, keeping him delighted.</font>

334
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,640
<font color="yellow">Every day. Gently.</font>

335
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,270
<font color="yellow">On top of that, my Hoon
wrote this amazing scenario...</font>

336
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,300
<font color="yellow">You have such a great girlfriend.</font>

337
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:53,470
<font color="yellow">I... would like to say
something a little embarrassing.</font>

338
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,900
<font color="yellow">It's something really embarrassing.</font>

339
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,800
<font color="yellow">I... love you.</font>

340
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,600
<font color="yellow">I love you too.</font>

341
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,090
<font color="yellow">- Anna!
- Park Hoon!</font>

342
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,720
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

343
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,790
<font color="yellow">We're going to get married.</font>

344
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,900
<font color="yellow">We're meeting with our mothers tomorrow.</font>

345
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,440
<font color="yellow">- Congrats. Congratulations.
- Thank you.</font>

346
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,220
<font color="yellow">Don't you have something more to say?</font>

347
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,380
<font color="yellow">Before we get married,
we're just going to live together.</font>

348
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,350
<font color="yellow">- Starting today.
- Enough. I might cut off our ties.</font>

349
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,870
<font color="yellow">I'm your brother-in-law. You can't
cut ties off with your brother-in-law.</font>

350
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,910
<font color="yellow">- The two of us are dating.
- You two are only going to date?</font>

351
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,770
<font color="yellow">Put your younger brother in his place.</font>

352
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,290
<font color="yellow">I... am pregnant.</font>

353
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,390
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

354
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,620
<font color="yellow">She's going to be in our family.
She was going to find out soon anyway.</font>

355
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,750
<font color="yellow">So that's why...</font>

356
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:04,180
<font color="yellow">you stood outside every day
and couldn't come in.</font>

357
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,230
<font color="yellow">Did your parents approve of
living together before the wedding?</font>

358
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,500
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Wow.</font>

359
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,870
<font color="yellow">- Good for you.
- You two are living together too.</font>

360
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,750
<font color="yellow">Well, we're not exactly
living together yet...</font>

361
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,140
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

362
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,620
<font color="yellow">I know it's been tough for you two.</font>

363
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,960
<font color="yellow">I wish you a happy life together.</font>

364
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,750
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

365
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,540
<font color="yellow">Now we've said
"I love you" to each other!</font>

366
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,910
<font color="yellow">What is she saying?</font>

367
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,390
<font color="yellow">Hoon says he loves me.</font>

368
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,620
<font color="yellow">Now that he says that L word,
it's time to fart in front of me.</font>

369
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,210
<font color="yellow">If so, we're really in a relationship.</font>

370
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,120
<font color="yellow">I can already fart in front of her.</font>

371
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,790
<font color="yellow">There are steps to follow.</font>

372
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,560
<font color="yellow">Farting openly comes
after saying "I love you."</font>

373
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,230
<font color="yellow">You haven't said
"I love you" to each other yet?</font>

374
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,830
<font color="yellow">- Have you?
- Of course we have.</font>

375
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,830
<font color="yellow">How would I decide to move in together
without saying that first?</font>

376
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,450
<font color="yellow">I never thought you were
capable of saying that.</font>

377
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,080
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you yet?</font>

378
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,390
<font color="yellow">It's not hard. I can do it right now.</font>

379
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,460
<font color="yellow">You should say that
when you really feel it.</font>

380
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,540
<font color="yellow">If you just blurt it out, you're dead.</font>

381
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,020
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of things you two
should do with each other.</font>

382
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,000
<font color="yellow">You should also speak
informally to each other.</font>

383
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,660
<font color="yellow">- They're going to live together.
- What?</font>

384
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,700
<font color="yellow">- We're going to get married.
- What?</font>

385
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,560
<font color="yellow">They started to live together yesterday.</font>

386
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,000
<font color="yellow">Let's go upstairs.</font>

387
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,620
<font color="yellow">We will leave first.</font>

388
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,450
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

389
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,430
<font color="yellow">He's so on top of the world these days.</font>

390
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,580
<font color="yellow">They're really living together?
Seriously?</font>

391
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,100
<font color="yellow">So cool. You're so cool, honey.</font>

392
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,140
<font color="yellow">Did you see these veins popping here?</font>

393
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,520
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

394
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,480
<font color="yellow">It was left at the front door.</font>

395
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,140
<font color="yellow"><i>[To my future son-in-law Park]</i></font>

396
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,080
<font color="yellow"><i>We should've had many
chances to eat together.</i></font>

397
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,600
<font color="yellow"><i>So I would know what you like
and what I should make for you.</i></font>

398
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,210
<font color="yellow"><i>We've only eaten together twice.</i></font>

399
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,560
<font color="yellow"><i>I just packed some things
I thought you might like.</i></font>

400
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,430
<font color="yellow"><i>I think people get married
not because they're in love</i></font>

401
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,310
<font color="yellow"><i>but because they're loyal to each other.</i></font>

402
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:32,210
<font color="yellow"><i>Marriage is knowing that one small thing
could cause you break up.</i></font>

403
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,290
<font color="yellow"><i>So I hope you stay together
for a long time.</i></font>

404
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,450
<font color="yellow">Do you know your daughter lives
in my son's place right now?</font>

405
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,620
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who dropped her off there.</font>

406
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,200
<font color="yellow">Surprisingly, you're open-minded
about that, huh?</font>

407
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,680
<font color="yellow">You don't look that way though.</font>

408
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:22,200
<font color="yellow">They seemed like they were so in love.</font>

409
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,680
<font color="yellow">There won't be many days of feeling
so in love for the rest of their lives.</font>

410
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,460
<font color="yellow">And not many people
get to experience that.</font>

411
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,950
<font color="yellow">I don't want them to worry about
what other people might say.</font>

412
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,810
<font color="yellow">I want them to be
as happy as they can be.</font>

413
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,480
<font color="yellow">That's why I dropped her off there.</font>

414
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,910
<font color="yellow">But still that's not the way to go.</font>

415
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,310
<font color="yellow">Especially since enough people
already know how they met.</font>

416
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,750
<font color="yellow">They need to take even more
proper steps to get married.</font>

417
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,430
<font color="yellow">But people will still find things
to say about them.</font>

418
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,020
<font color="yellow">I asked her to move in.</font>

419
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,540
<font color="yellow">But the woman shouldn't
just follow your lead.</font>

420
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,290
<font color="yellow">I don't feel good about this.</font>

421
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,310
<font color="yellow">I never thought my son would start
living with someone before his wedding.</font>

422
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,890
<font color="yellow">There are proper steps to follow
when it comes to marriage and all.</font>

423
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,890
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung is pregnant.</font>

424
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,730
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't be ridiculous.</font>

425
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,100
<font color="yellow">How can she be pregnant
when she's not even married?</font>

426
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,270
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

427
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,620
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

428
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,580
<font color="yellow">Then.</font>

429
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,660
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

430
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,830
<font color="yellow">She seems so tough,
but she's nothing.</font>

431
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,680
<font color="yellow">She's easy.
She shouldn't give you a hard time.</font>

432
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,790
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about her.</font>

433
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,790
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead.
- I will call you.</font>

434
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,290
<font color="yellow">How could you say that
in the middle of it?</font>

435
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

436
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,430
<font color="yellow">Is it true?</font>

437
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,790
<font color="yellow">Is Soo Kyung pregnant for sure?</font>

438
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,200
<font color="yellow">- She is.
- Who is the guy?</font>

439
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,700
<font color="yellow">It's Jin Sang.</font>

440
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,700
<font color="yellow">She hit the jackpot.</font>

441
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,330
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

442
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,310
<font color="yellow">Is the toilet clogged?</font>

443
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,180
<font color="yellow">Is it number two?</font>

444
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,850
<font color="yellow">Go unclog it then!</font>

445
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,480
<font color="yellow">- I can't.
- I can't either!</font>

446
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,580
<font color="yellow">Call someone to do it then.</font>

447
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,080
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

448
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,790
<font color="yellow">Should we just leave it then?</font>

449
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,960
<font color="yellow">Let's move out. No one can get inside.</font>

450
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,000
<font color="yellow">- You go unclog it, man.
- Are you crazy?</font>

451
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,500
<font color="yellow">It's gross to see someone else's poop.</font>

452
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,890
<font color="yellow">I can't even unclog mine.</font>

453
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,830
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

454
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,930
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it's okay.
I will unclog it.</font>

455
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,890
<font color="yellow">Do you seriously plan to move then?</font>

456
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,980
<font color="yellow">I can do this. I can do this.</font>

457
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,160
<font color="yellow">I can totally do this. I can do it!</font>

458
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,290
<font color="yellow">It's been unclogged?</font>

459
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,700
<font color="yellow">Wipe the toilet.
Spray some air freshener too.</font>

460
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,270
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Everything is okay now.</font>

461
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,790
<font color="yellow">I did a great job in there.</font>

462
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,830
<font color="yellow">You should've seen me.</font>

463
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,870
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it's okay.</font>

464
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,580
<font color="yellow">We already made a baby together.
Can't I unclog the toilet for you?</font>

465
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,450
<font color="yellow">- You came.
- Good that you came.</font>

466
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,000
<font color="yellow">- This is the sound director.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

467
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,370
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat.
- Sure.</font>

468
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,500
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat.</font>

469
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,750
<font color="yellow">My movie only has a few lines.</font>

470
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,620
<font color="yellow">- True.
- The sounds will have to do the job.</font>

471
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,230
<font color="yellow">They will help the audience
feel the scenes.</font>

472
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,770
<font color="yellow">He was in charge of producing the sound.</font>

473
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,910
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm craving pork belly.</i></font>

474
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,910
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's have pork belly tonight, okay?</i></font>

475
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,810
<font color="yellow"><i>I almost forgot. You have
plans tonight, don't you?</i></font>

476
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,810
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's have pork belly next time then.</i></font>

477
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,810
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't want to eat it alone.</i></font>

478
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,080
<font color="yellow"><i>Enjoy your dinner
and I will see you at home.</i></font>

479
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,810
<font color="yellow">- Long time no see.
- It is.</font>

480
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,770
<font color="yellow">- Good to see you.
- So good to see you.</font>

481
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,330
<font color="yellow">Say hi. This is the sound director.</font>

482
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,430
<font color="yellow">Wow, the sounds were
really good this time.</font>

483
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,810
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

484
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,080
<font color="yellow">Director Yang, I will get going.</font>

485
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,080
<font color="yellow">- Leaving already?
- Yes.</font>

486
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,520
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

487
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,660
<font color="yellow">- Leaving already?
- I'm sorry.</font>

488
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,600
<font color="yellow">Bye then.</font>

489
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,250
<font color="yellow">- You said you'd be late.
- It ended early.</font>

490
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,540
<font color="yellow">It's pork belly.</font>

491
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,000
<font color="yellow">I will go change first.</font>

492
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,020
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

493
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,210
<font color="yellow">Pork belly tastes best
when I crave it.</font>

494
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,270
<font color="yellow">Here it is.</font>

495
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:29,480
<font color="yellow">Now again, I will do
what I have never done before.</font>

496
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,980
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat it off my hand this once.</font>

497
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,500
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- Please do it. It's not hard.</font>

498
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,710
<font color="yellow">Say ah.</font>

499
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,210
<font color="yellow">Please take it.</font>

500
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,850
<font color="yellow">All you need to do is
open your mouth, seriously.</font>

501
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,270
<font color="yellow">It was no big deal, wasn't it?</font>

502
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,520
<font color="yellow">I hear you are pregnant.</font>

503
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,600
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

504
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,160
<font color="yellow">It might be the best thing
you've ever done for yourself.</font>

505
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,810
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you first.</font>

506
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,850
<font color="yellow">Jin Sang fooled around a lot
when he was young.</font>

507
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:24,640
<font color="yellow">He's more likely to settle
down well after marriage.</font>

508
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,020
<font color="yellow"><i>If a man gets a taste of
fooling around after marriage</i></font>

509
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,020
<font color="yellow">there is no solution.</font>

510
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,710
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

511
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,580
<font color="yellow">don't worry and be good to him.</font>

512
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,230
<font color="yellow">But it's not romantic between us.</font>

513
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,060
<font color="yellow">We haven't even held hands properly,
yet we sleep together just fine.</font>

514
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,830
<font color="yellow">It's all chaotic.</font>

515
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,390
<font color="yellow">Hey, how old are you?</font>

516
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,790
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too old to ask for romance?</font>

517
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,120
<font color="yellow">Plus, that should end
when you're pregnant.</font>

518
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,870
<font color="yellow">Romance my butt.</font>

519
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,080
<font color="yellow">But still...</font>

520
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,370
<font color="yellow">We haven't even said
"I love you" to each other yet.</font>

521
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:04,020
<font color="yellow">We haven't even held hands properly yet.</font>

522
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,100
<font color="yellow">How? How?</font>

523
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,060
<font color="yellow">- What?
- How?</font>

524
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,850
<font color="yellow">How could he possibly touch my poop?</font>

525
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,290
<font color="yellow">- Thanks for the food.
- Sure.</font>

526
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,120
<font color="yellow">I love having a sister-in-law.</font>

527
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,370
<font color="yellow">I get to borrow your delicious dishes.</font>

528
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,910
<font color="yellow">Your mom is such a good cook.</font>

529
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,000
<font color="yellow">Then.</font>

530
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,890
<font color="yellow">By the way, was everything okay?</font>

531
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,310
<font color="yellow">I heard you left the meeting early.</font>

532
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,660
<font color="yellow">You were invited to a meeting
with famous directors.</font>

533
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,580
<font color="yellow">It means that he thinks you're good.</font>

534
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,710
<font color="yellow">Call him up.
Director Yang seems a bit mad.</font>

535
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,910
<font color="yellow">- Get some rest.
- Will do.</font>

536
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,180
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave so early?</font>

537
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,790
<font color="yellow">You should've stayed longer.</font>

538
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,950
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to have pork belly.</font>

539
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,290
<font color="yellow">Shall we download a movie and watch?</font>

540
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,270
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

541
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:48,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Actually, I'm waiting now.</i></font>

542
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:53,960
<font color="yellow"><i>I can still continue to wait, but...</i></font>

543
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:09,500
<font color="yellow"><i>But for some reason, this moment
seems like our last time together. </i></font>

544
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,680
<font color="yellow">Your concert went well.
Now what's the problem again?</font>

545
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,810
<font color="yellow">You came by to keep
an eye on me at this hour?</font>

546
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,890
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this to save me or him?</font>

547
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,710
<font color="yellow">Both of you.</font>

548
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,390
<font color="yellow"><i>How have you been all day?</i></font>

549
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,390
<font color="yellow"><i>- How about you? Good?
- Yes.</i></font>

550
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,120
<font color="yellow"><i>I was busy today
recording for the weekend.</i></font>

551
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,680
<font color="yellow"><i>How about you?</i></font>

552
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,230
<font color="yellow"><i>I was so busy this morning. </i></font>

553
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,060
<font color="yellow"><i>I have a lot of patients in wintertime. </i></font>

554
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,960
<font color="yellow"><i>So I had Jjajangmyun delivered
and had it for lunch with Jee Hoon. </i></font>

555
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,810
<font color="yellow"><i>When I meet someone new later</i></font>

556
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,270
<font color="yellow">how much should I come clean about this?</font>

557
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,060
<font color="yellow">There is only one thing you
shouldn't say to your girlfriend.</font>

558
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,330
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

559
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

560
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:14,930
<font color="yellow">I think I was destined
to say that for your sake.</font>

561
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,230
<font color="yellow">So you'd meet someone better.</font>

562
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,830
<font color="yellow"><i>The test results came out.</i></font>

563
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,290
<font color="yellow"><i>I see.</i></font>

564
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,770
<font color="yellow">I wish you happiness.</font>

565
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,270
<font color="yellow">I mean it. I'm serious.</font>

566
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,500
<font color="yellow">It's true that
you were good to me, Tae Jin.</font>

567
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,390
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

568
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,210
<font color="yellow"><i>The results came out
sooner than expected.</i></font>

569
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,700
<font color="yellow">What? You came and unclogged the toilet?</font>

570
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,810
<font color="yellow">Quiet down, will you?</font>

571
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,790
<font color="yellow">When a guy unclogs
the toilet after you go</font>

572
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,000
<font color="yellow">he will stick around for life.</font>

573
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,960
<font color="yellow">How could you unclog the toilet
when you haven't even said "I love you"?</font>

574
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,910
<font color="yellow">It's almost the last step to
conquer between a couple.</font>

575
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,680
<font color="yellow">They're following the steps in reverse.</font>

576
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,020
<font color="yellow">They made a baby first
and now they're dating.</font>

577
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,560
<font color="yellow">What? A baby?</font>

578
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,160
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

579
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:22,060
<font color="yellow">You're a couple who follows
the steps in reverse now?</font>

580
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,460
<font color="yellow">Wow, how cool.</font>

581
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,890
<font color="yellow">- How is that cool?
- It is cool.</font>

582
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:31,600
<font color="yellow">Usually, couples say "I love you" first
and start to speak informally.</font>

583
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,160
<font color="yellow">And then they fart in front of
the other and unclog the toilet next.</font>

584
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,500
<font color="yellow">And lastly, they make a baby.</font>

585
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,580
<font color="yellow">It's reversed.</font>

586
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,600
<font color="yellow">They made a baby, unclogged the toilet,
and farted in front of the other.</font>

587
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,210

all three years in high school.</font>

616

621
