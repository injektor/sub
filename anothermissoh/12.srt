55
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,650
<font color="yellow"><i>So when I was in high school, there was
this girl who had the same name as me.</i></font>

56
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,680
<font color="yellow">- Sure.
- Because she was so awesome...</font>

57
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I wasn't.</font>

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
<font color="yellow">But because she was so freaking amazing,
I was constantly compared to her.</font>

59
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,790
<font color="yellow">And I was just mistreated
because of her.</font>

60
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,000
<font color="yellow"><i>There were just so many things
that happened.</i></font>

61
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,110
<font color="yellow"><i>Anyway, I had
a tiring life because of her.</i></font>

62
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,290
<font color="yellow"><i>But...</i></font>

63
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,550
<font color="yellow"><i>I...</i></font>

64
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,400
<font color="yellow">The man I used to like was...</font>

65
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,190
<font color="yellow">once her fiancé.
But their wedding fell apart.</font>

66
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,620
<font color="yellow"><i>So he wanted to take revenge on her</i></font>

67
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,850
<font color="yellow">but accidentally,
my life was ruined instead of hers.</font>

68
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,080

69
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,710
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

70
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,390
<font color="yellow">Could you tell us
your story in detail again?</font>

71
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,780
<font color="yellow"><i>So what happened is...</i></font>

72
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,590
<font color="yellow">Because he couldn't forget
about what happened with her</font>

73
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,600
<font color="yellow"><i>he ruined my wedding,
thinking that he was ruining hers.</i></font>

74
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,810
<font color="yellow"><i>Wait. Hold on. Hold on.</i></font>

75
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,660
<font color="yellow">How could he mistake
your wedding for hers?</font>

76
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Because she and I have the same name!
We have the same name.</i></font>

77
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,940
<font color="yellow">So that man thought
she was the one getting married</font>

78
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,240
<font color="yellow">and ruined my wedding instead!</font>

79
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,920
<font color="yellow">I get this feeling. This feeling...</font>

80
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,910
<font color="yellow"><i>But without knowing any of this</i></font>

81
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,870
<font color="yellow">I fell for that man.</font>

82
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,410
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Hold on.</font>

83
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,550
<font color="yellow">So you didn't recognize your nemesis
and fell in love with him?</font>

84
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,250
<font color="yellow">So what is your problem now?</font>

85
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,210
<font color="yellow"><i>I just don't know what to do.</i></font>

86
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,540
<font color="yellow">One moment,
I want to kill him out of anger.</font>

87
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,710
<font color="yellow">But in another moment...</font>

88
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,020
<font color="yellow">- But again...
- Just go to sleep.</font>

89
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,610
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't stay sad and gloomy. Don't go on
useless blind dates. Just go to sleep.</i></font>

90
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,890
<font color="yellow">Once you wake up, you'll be hungry.</font>

91
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,180
<font color="yellow">Then eat. Then sleep again.</font>

92
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,280
<font color="yellow">Once you wake up,
you'll be hungry again. Then eat again.</font>

93
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,900
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

94
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,920
<font color="yellow"><i>This isn't why I took
the courage to call you guys.</i></font>

95
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,200
<font color="yellow">- Then just be reborn.
- Do you think that makes any sense?</font>

96
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,040
<font color="yellow">Are you saying my current life is ruined
so I should just die and be reborn?</font>

97
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,690
<font color="yellow"><i>It sounds like you're very upset.</i></font>

98
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,250
<font color="yellow">So please calm down.
That's not what we meant.</font>

99
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,070
<font color="yellow">What's so hard about being reborn?</font>

100
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,360
<font color="yellow"><i>If you completely let go of your past,
you can be reborn.</i></font>

101
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,240
<font color="yellow">Have you seen infants
with past memories?</font>

102
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,210
<font color="yellow">"I've experienced these things.
Thus, I'm this kind of person."</font>

103
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,030
<font color="yellow">If you let go of that mindset
and your past, you can be reborn.</font>

104
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,360
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's
as easy as it sounds?</font>

105
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,480
<font color="yellow">How could I pretend like
nothing has happened?</font>

106
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,730
<font color="yellow">"Here we go. Let's erase all of
your past. Let go of your memories."</font>

107
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,970
<font color="yellow">Would that just make everything go away?</font>

108
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,700
<font color="yellow">If you want to be miserable,
then hold onto your past.</font>

109
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,400
<font color="yellow"><i>It's your call.</i></font>

110
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,460
<font color="yellow">That's what life is about.</font>

111
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,950
<font color="yellow">Who could stop a person
who's determined to be miserable?</font>

112
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,450
<font color="yellow"><i>How cruel.</i></font>

113
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,570
<font color="yellow">You should give me realistic advice.</font>

114
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,480
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much pain
I'm in right now?</font>

115
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,560
<font color="yellow">If I could, I would like to kill both</font>

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,940
<font color="yellow">that man and Oh Hae Young!</font>

117
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,320

you would like to stay anonymous?</i></font>

118

- Yeah. I've revealed her name. Not mine!</font>

119
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,450
<font color="yellow">But you told us earlier that
you two have the same name.</font>

120
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

121
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,240
<font color="yellow"><i>- Hello?</i>

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,140
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

123
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

124
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,280
<font color="yellow"><i>My goodness. There are so many people
with the name Oh Hae Young.</i></font>

125
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,860
<font color="yellow">Your name doesn't mean anything.</font>

126
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,240
<font color="yellow">My name, Lee Byung Joo, means nothing.</font>

127
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,350
<font color="yellow">So what does it matter?</font>

128
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,540
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh Hae Young?</font>

129
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,980

<font color="yellow"><i>Your name means nothing.</i></font>

131
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,940
<font color="yellow"><i>And the other Oh Hae Young's name
doesn't mean anything either.</i></font>

132
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,720
<font color="yellow"><i>Our DJ Shin Young's name
means nothing too.</i></font>

133
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,490
<font color="yellow"><i>Sir, you've said her name too many times.
She's supposed to remain anonymous.</i></font>

134
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,310
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Okay.
I'll maintain anonymity.</font>

135
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,400
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

136
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,800
<font color="yellow">- Anonymous Oh Hae Young.

137
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,750

about you. What are you going to do?</font>

139
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,140

that group chat immediately.</font>

140

Can't you guys let it go?</font>

143
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,640

00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,190
<font color="yellow"><i>was because of that?</i></font>

147
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,730
<font color="yellow"><i>Deok Hee!</i></font>

148
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,490
<font color="yellow">Deok Hee!</font>

149
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,650
<font color="yellow">Does Hae Young have no pride?
How could she fall for a man like that?</font>

150
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,370
<font color="yellow">- Is she crazy?
- She liked him because she didn't know!</font>

151
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,990
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

152
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,540
<font color="yellow">Listen to it. She even asked for
voice modulation to remain anonymous</font>

153
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,900
<font color="yellow">but she revealed her name on her own.</font>

154
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,820
<font color="yellow">How could Assistant Manager Oh come to
work now? How embarrassing for her!</font>

155
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,420
<font color="yellow">This clip has been circulating all day
as one of the funny clips!</font>

156
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,470
<font color="yellow">When I tell people I work with her,
they want to come see her face!</font>

157
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,720
<font color="yellow">So that's why she beat Manager Oh up
that day and caused a scene.</font>

158
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,560
<font color="yellow">That was after she found out her wedding
was ruined because of Manager Oh.</font>

159
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,440
<font color="yellow">Yeah. And yet she kept on saying,
"I'm the one who called the wedding off."</font>

160
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,880
<font color="yellow">That's enough!</font>

161
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,880
<font color="yellow">- Are you having fun?
- What's wrong? This is funny.</font>

162
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,310
<font color="yellow">What if she was your little sister?</font>

163
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,440
<font color="yellow">- Still funny?
- You're looking after your team member?</font>

164
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,200
<font color="yellow">Sorry.
He's making me look like the mean guy.</font>

165
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,990
<font color="yellow">You guys are being mean!
The things that you are saying!</font>

166
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,440
<font color="yellow">Imagine if your little sister's marriage</font>

167
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,820
<font color="yellow">was ruined because of a stranger.
How would you feel?</font>

168
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,990
<font color="yellow">- Would you still be saying these things?
- Stop it. That's enough.</font>

169
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,000
<font color="yellow">Why even bother?
Are you guys even her colleagues?</font>

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,360
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Let's go. Come on.</font>

171
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
<font color="yellow">- It was just for fun.
- Come one. Let's go. Sorry.</font>

172
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,430
<font color="yellow">Manager Oh.</font>

173
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,320
<font color="yellow">That man must have loved you a lot.</font>

174
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,760
<font color="yellow">Have you listened to it? Ms. Oh's
voice recording is all over the Internet.</font>

175
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,520
<font color="yellow">Let's get back to work.</font>

176
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,780
<font color="yellow">I found out only a few days ago too.</font>

177
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,100
<font color="yellow">All of this happened</font>

178
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,750
<font color="yellow">since the day you disappeared.</font>

179
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,460
<font color="yellow">- You're aware of that, right?
- Yes.</font>

180
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,190
<font color="yellow">Have some remorse.</font>

181
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,820
<font color="yellow">Did you hear it on the radio?
I was so shocked!</font>

182
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,130
<font color="yellow">Of course I heard it! So funny.</font>

183
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,020
<font color="yellow">My stomach hurts from laughing. Oh my.</font>

184
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,910
<font color="yellow">So before Hae Young does something
crazy again, we should do something.</font>

185
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,730
<font color="yellow">No matter how crazy she is</font>

186
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,340
<font color="yellow">Hae Young isn't the kind of person
to harm another person.</font>

187
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,590
<font color="yellow">If she were to kill someone, would she
publicly announce it on the radio?</font>

188
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,200
<font color="yellow">She's not that stupid.</font>

189
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,300
<font color="yellow">- She's right.
- What do you mean? She still said...</font>

190
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,200
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Someone's calling me. Hello?</font>

191
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,930
<font color="yellow">So tell people it wasn't that
Oh Hae Young! It was someone else!</font>

192
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,700
<font color="yellow">So I think that did kind of
sound like our Hae Young.</font>

193
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,060
<font color="yellow">But it could also not be her.
It's just--</font>

194
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you so curious?</font>

195
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,190
<font color="yellow">Even if you thought it was our Hae Young</font>

196
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,050
<font color="yellow">why would you call our house
and ask about it?</font>

197
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,420
<font color="yellow">Based on your actions, I can tell
how twisted of a person you are!</font>

198
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,480
<font color="yellow">Let's just wait and see what kind of
misfortune comes your children's way!</font>

199
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,110
<font color="yellow">Why even bother answering
these stupid calls?</font>

200
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,130
<font color="yellow">That was my mom.</font>

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,950
<font color="yellow">What is Hae Young doing?</font>

202
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,280
<font color="yellow"><i>The name "Oh Hae Young" is
all over the Internet!</i></font>

203
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,090
<font color="yellow">People have sent me this "funny clip"
all day and all of them are sending me</font>

204
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,840
<font color="yellow">her voice recording from the radio!</font>

205
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,320
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you going to do now?</i></font>

206
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,390
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you know how much pain
I'm in right now?</i></font>

207
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,200
<font color="yellow"><i>If I could, I would like to kill both</i></font>

208
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,900
<font color="yellow"><i>that man and Oh Hae Young!</i></font>

209
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,100
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry, but didn't you say
you would like to stay anonymous?</i></font>

210
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,390
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah. I've revealed her name. Not mine!</i></font>

211
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,480
<font color="yellow"><i>But you told us earlier that
you two have the same name.</i></font>

212
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,040
<font color="yellow">- Same name...
<i>- Hello?</i></font>

213
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,210
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello? Hello?</i></font>

214
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,990
<font color="yellow">Why would you share this
to our group chat?</font>

215
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,780
<font color="yellow">Go delete this before
Director Park checks it! Hurry!</font>

216
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,810
<font color="yellow">Go! You bastard! Go!</font>

217
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,220
<font color="yellow">Director Park... Could I see your phone?</font>

218
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,200
<font color="yellow">Could you unlock your phone for me?</font>

219
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,390
<font color="yellow">- I'll delete it.
- Thank you.</font>

220
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

221
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,940
<font color="yellow">Bring me the recordings
that we did today.</font>

222
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,070
<font color="yellow">Eat up.
It's fine. It's all good.</font>

223
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,540
<font color="yellow">No one dies from something like this.
It's not a big deal. It's nothing.</font>

224
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,140
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Eat.</font>

225
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,570
<font color="yellow">Have something to eat
and just stay warm.</font>

226
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,130
<font color="yellow">Let's just live our lives. Who cares?</font>

227
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,240
<font color="yellow">If you had told me earlier</font>

228
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,620
<font color="yellow">I would have sent them to jail!
I could have done something!</font>

229
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,520
<font color="yellow">Why would you keep it a secret
from me and suffer by yourself?</font>

230
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,860
<font color="yellow">Keep your head up and eat.</font>

231
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,850
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

232
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

233
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,310
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Why would you be sorry?</font>

234
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,490
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't have given you
such a common name.</font>

235
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,570
<font color="yellow">We were too careless
when coming up with your name.</font>

236
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,370
<font color="yellow">I told you we shouldn't use
the name "Hae Young."</font>

237
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,470
<font color="yellow">We considered "So Ra"
and "Soo Bin" too! Why "Hae Young"?</font>

238
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you blaming it on Dad?
It's some other guy's fault.</font>

239
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,440
<font color="yellow">You just give up on that man.</font>

240
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,210
<font color="yellow">No need to stay angry.
Just shut your mind down and forget it.</font>

241
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,400
<font color="yellow">Stop thinking about it.
Just end things with him.</font>

242
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,430
<font color="yellow">I heard you can get some monetary
compensation with a lawyer's help.</font>

243
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,110
<font color="yellow">But what's the point?</font>

244
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,160
<font color="yellow">Instead of constantly seeing his face
and being upset all the time</font>

245
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,880
<font color="yellow">just be done with him.</font>

246
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,620
<font color="yellow">If you take things further,
you'll become the ridiculous one.</font>

247
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,700
<font color="yellow">If you take things further, people will
only point fingers at you. Not them.</font>

248
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,020
<font color="yellow">So just shut your mind down
and be done with him.</font>

249
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,300
<font color="yellow">Be done.</font>

250
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,490
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering me?</font>

251
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,830
<font color="yellow">Do you still have feelings for him?</font>

252
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,400
<font color="yellow">Fine. You could have liked him
when you didn't know about any of this!</font>

253
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,630
<font color="yellow">How could you like him after
you've found out about everything?</font>

254
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,070
<font color="yellow">I could shred him into pieces!
I would hate his guts!</font>

255
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,560
<font color="yellow">If you still like him after all of this</font>

256
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,890
<font color="yellow">you are the biggest idiot
in the entire world.</font>

257
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,710
<font color="yellow">You would be the craziest bitch!
You know?</font>

258
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,190
<font color="yellow">I do know.</font>

259
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,360
<font color="yellow">I know all of this.</font>

260
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,510
<font color="yellow">But I just can't control my heart.</font>

261
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,990
<font color="yellow">Thank god she didn't at least
reveal your name.</font>

262
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,670
<font color="yellow">I was so scared the whole time
I was listening to it.</font>

263
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,530
<font color="yellow">How could she make such a mistake?</font>

264
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,980
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

265
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,850
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

266
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,220
<font color="yellow">Here's another woman
who is out of her mind.</font>

267
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,140
<font color="yellow">I can't believe a day like this
has come in my life.</font>

268
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,210
<font color="yellow">The day I'm disappointed
with Park Do Kyung.</font>

269
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,220
<font color="yellow">Cheer up.</font>

270
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,400
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

271
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,360
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you beating him up?
Shouldn't you kick him in the knees?</font>

272
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,410
<font color="yellow">You used to beat the crap out of me
for petty things.</font>

273
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,900
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you beating him up?
Are you favoring him over me?</font>

274
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,520
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't yell at a person...</font>

275
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,140
<font color="yellow">who has truly done something wrong.</font>

276
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,730
<font color="yellow">It's because he's already in
a lot of pain.</font>

277
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,520
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

278
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,680
<font color="yellow">So the things that I've done
in the past weren't</font>

279
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,850
<font color="yellow">so terribly bad. I see how it is.</font>

280
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,630
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll do some really
bad things from now on. Okay?</font>

281
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,720
<font color="yellow">How mean.</font>

282
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,600
<font color="yellow">- Have you talked to that woman?
- No.</font>

283
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,350
<font color="yellow">Were you the one who didn't call?
Or did she not answer your calls?</font>

284
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,770
<font color="yellow">I didn't call her.</font>

285
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,100
<font color="yellow">You're just so cruel.</font>

286
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,300
<font color="yellow">Did you even like her? Genuinely?</font>

287
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,600
<font color="yellow">How could you not call her
in a situation like this?</font>

288
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,280
<font color="yellow">Out of everyone,
you should have called her.</font>

289
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,790
<font color="yellow">- How could you do nothing?
- What would I tell her?</font>

290
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,320
<font color="yellow">Would I ask her if she's okay?</font>

291
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,120
<font color="yellow">Those words aren't worth saying.</font>

292
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,340
<font color="yellow">I can't find a single word
to say to her.</font>

293
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,180
<font color="yellow">"I love you."</font>

294
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,250
<font color="yellow">- Wouldn't that be enough?
- That's for flattery.</font>

295
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,170
<font color="yellow">That's just to calm her down.</font>

296
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,720
<font color="yellow">Why do you always interpret
that phrase like that?</font>

297
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
<font color="yellow">That phrase just doesn't fit
with this situation.</font>

298
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,120
<font color="yellow">The phrase "I love you" is...</font>

299
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,230
<font color="yellow">always the right thing to say.</font>

300
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,200
<font color="yellow"><i>[The Woman Next Door]</i></font>

301
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,710
<font color="yellow"><i>[The Woman Next Door]</i></font>

302
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Please leave a message after the beep...</i></font>

303
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,370
<font color="yellow">Hello...</font>

304
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,250
<font color="yellow">How long will you
freeload off of them?</font>

305
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,550
<font color="yellow">Who's freeloading off of whom?
He's our family.</font>

306
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,520
<font color="yellow">You guys aren't even blood-related.</font>

307
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,070
<font color="yellow">But we've grown closer
through all these years.</font>

308
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,480
<font color="yellow">I'm closer to him than
my blood-related family.</font>

309
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,700
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

310
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,320
<font color="yellow">Hello, ma'am.</font>

311
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,950
<font color="yellow">- You live here too?
- Just temporarily.</font>

312
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,370
<font color="yellow">I've done a lot of things wrong.
So this is my hideout place.</font>

313
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,570
<font color="yellow">You let guests in all the time.</font>

314
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,660
<font color="yellow">Yet you won't even let
your mom set a foot in here.</font>

315
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,910
<font color="yellow">What brings you here so early?</font>

316
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,620
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married tomorrow.</font>

317
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,970
<font color="yellow">Again?</font>

318
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,930
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung couldn't even do it once.
But this is your third time.</font>

319
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,430
<font color="yellow">Wow. That's so great.
I have so much respect for you!</font>

320
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,670
<font color="yellow">Wearing a wedding dress at
that old and wrinkly age isn't</font>

321
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,590
<font color="yellow">something to brag about.</font>

322
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,080
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to wear a wedding dress.</font>

323
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,160
<font color="yellow">At CEO Jang's 70th birthday,
he's just going to introduce me.</font>

324
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,380
<font color="yellow">- You're not coming, right?
- No.</font>

325
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,660
<font color="yellow">- That's what I thought.
- Should I at least--</font>

326
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,400
<font color="yellow">- Only Do Kyung needs to come.
- Sure.</font>

327
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,850
<font color="yellow">By the way, why isn't he
picking up his phone again?</font>

328
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,280
<font color="yellow">You see...</font>

329
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,270
<font color="yellow">It's because he's in a sticky situation.</font>

330
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,980
<font color="yellow">- What sticky situation?
- You see--</font>

331
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,580
<font color="yellow">We don't know the full story either.
He doesn't talk about these things...</font>

332
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,250
<font color="yellow">Tell Do Kyung he doesn't have to buy
CEO Jang's gift because I've bought one.</font>

333
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,150
<font color="yellow">Tell him to just send me money.
Seven million won.</font>

334
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,480
<font color="yellow">He should at least give me that much.</font>

335
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,680
<font color="yellow">I'll be bringing home a lot more.</font>

336
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,330
<font color="yellow">You just wait.
I'll make a ton of money</font>

337
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,800
<font color="yellow">and let you guys live in luxury.</font>

338
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,150
<font color="yellow">Live in luxury? Who?</font>

339
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,020
<font color="yellow">None of us are poor.</font>

340
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,640
<font color="yellow">We all have jobs
and are doing fine with our lives.</font>

341
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,690
<font color="yellow">You just worry about your own damn life!</font>

342
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,550
<font color="yellow">Your face is getting worse
and worse as you age!</font>

343
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,450
<font color="yellow">Quit drinking!</font>

344
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,850
<font color="yellow">You look older than your mom!</font>

345
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,250
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying you have to
get married three times.</font>

346
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,120
<font color="yellow">But shouldn't you do it at least once?</font>

347
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,770
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your wedding.</font>

348
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,510
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

349
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,790
<font color="yellow">She's an embarrassment.</font>

350
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,810
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed that
she's my daughter.</font>

351
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,010
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about her.</font>

352
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,290
<font color="yellow">You know how she is. She always
says all these meaningless things.</font>

353
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,700
<font color="yellow">Now that I think about it,
you and Do Kyung are nothing like her.</font>

354
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,250
<font color="yellow">You two take after your dad.</font>

355
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,500
<font color="yellow">Honest and genuine.</font>

356
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,760
<font color="yellow">Where did you leave your car
after getting drunk this time?</font>

357
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,370
<font color="yellow">You know.
I'm sure I'll find it somewhere.</font>

358
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,710
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

359
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,910
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Please open the door, sir.</font>

360
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,890
<font color="yellow">Because this lady is embarrassed,
I think she should get off the bus.</font>

361
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,070
<font color="yellow">Please don't stare.
Look away. Look away.</font>

362
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,740
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a call if she's hurt.
Don't stare. She's fine!</font>

363
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,580
<font color="yellow">My goodness.
I asked them not to stare.</font>

364
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,710
<font color="yellow">Just leave. Just drive, sir! Go! Go!</font>

365
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,340
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

366
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,960
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung. Are you all right?</font>

367
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,800
<font color="yellow">How could you sleep like that
and then trip like that?</font>

368
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,020
<font color="yellow">- Son of a bitch.
- Don't curse at him though.</font>

369
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,400
<font color="yellow">- I'm talking about you!
- Me?</font>

370
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,520
<font color="yellow">What did I do? I was looking after you.
I thought you might be embarrassed.</font>

371
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,750
<font color="yellow">I saw everything as
I was rolling down the bus.</font>

372
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,400
<font color="yellow">I saw you holding onto your phone
and staring at me with awe</font>

373
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,420
<font color="yellow">as I was rolling down the bus.</font>

374
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,950
<font color="yellow">I'm not even asking you to
let me borrow your shoulder.</font>

375
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,760
<font color="yellow">How could you stare with that kind of
expression as I was rolling down the bus?</font>

376
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,470
<font color="yellow">With your mouth wide open! Huh?</font>

377
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,960
<font color="yellow">Fine. I've got it. Get up.</font>

378
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,400
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung! Fine! I get it!
I've done wrong. Hurry and get up.</font>

379
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,550
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung! Soo Kyung?</font>

380
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,790
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung! Soo Kyung!</font>

381
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,720
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we take her head CT too?</font>

382
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,520
<font color="yellow">She rolled down the aisle like this</font>

383
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,650
<font color="yellow">and after she got off,
she slammed her head on the street.</font>

384
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,050
<font color="yellow">I think something went wrong
as she was rolling down.</font>

385
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,890
<font color="yellow">There's no need for a head CT.
You've been tired lately, right?</font>

386
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,800
<font color="yellow">Yes! She drinks a lot.</font>

387
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,990
<font color="yellow">- It's because of her liver, right?
- You should stop drinking.</font>

388
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,290
<font color="yellow">See? It's because of your liver!</font>

389
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,290
<font color="yellow">You're pregnant.</font>

390
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,310
<font color="yellow">You have anemia from your pregnancy.</font>

391
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,990
<font color="yellow">I'll prescribe iron supplements for you.
Make sure you take them. Congratulations.</font>

392
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,590
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

393
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,390
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

394
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,640
<font color="yellow">I think congratulations are in order.</font>

395
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,000
<font color="yellow">This is something I should
congratulate you on, right?</font>

396
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,480
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

397
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,460
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm crazy. This is serious,
but I can't help laughing.</font>

398
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:25,120
<font color="yellow">So it happened the last time
you saw him before he left, huh?</font>

399
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,500
<font color="yellow">How could you be so careless
even if it was the last time to see him?</font>

400
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,500
<font color="yellow">Let me see...</font>

401
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,890
<font color="yellow">Has he gone to Brazil or not?</font>

402
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,700
<font color="yellow">Call him now. What if he's already left?</font>

403
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,640
<font color="yellow">What would you do
if he hasn't leave yet?</font>

404
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

405
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you guys aren't even kids.</font>

406
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,180
<font color="yellow">When you were involved in such an act</font>

407
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,730
<font color="yellow">you should've been
more rational and prepared.</font>

408
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,500
<font color="yellow">Look at me. Although I'm with
a different woman every night</font>

409
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,980
<font color="yellow">I don't get myself in this situation.</font>

410
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,250
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung, this is completely his fault.</font>

411
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,390
<font color="yellow">As a guy</font>

412
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,180
<font color="yellow">he should've had protection
with him at all times.</font>

413
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,350
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

414
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,960
<font color="yellow">See? Look at it.</font>

415
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,210
<font color="yellow">I even have them here too. See?</font>

416
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,390
<font color="yellow">I even have one in here. And there is...</font>

417
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,640
<font color="yellow">Ah, there is another one in here.</font>

418
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,310
<font color="yellow">I can't show you that in here.</font>

419
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,460
<font color="yellow">Anyway, this shows
how responsible a guy should be.</font>

420
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sorry.</font>

421
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,250
<font color="yellow">It's not the time to talk about this.</font>

422
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,950
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to cry?</font>

423
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,950
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't cry.</font>

424
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,580
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- Get away from me, you bastard!</font>

425
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,930
<font color="yellow">Go away!</font>

426
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,000
<font color="yellow">This is a dream.</font>

427
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,020
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung, it's okay.</font>

428
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,350
<font color="yellow">Jin Sang, shall we go
to a different hospital?</font>

429
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,210
<font color="yellow">First, accept the fact.</font>

430
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,250
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me.</font>

431
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,910
<font color="yellow">- I will go get the doctor.
- Don't touch me.</font>

432
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,680
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

433
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,680
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

434
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
<font color="yellow">I can't remember it.</font>

435
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,500
<font color="yellow">Did we really do it?</font>

436
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,430
<font color="yellow"><i>Without knowing the whole truth</i></font>

437
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,330
<font color="yellow"><i>I fell in love with that guy.</i></font>

438
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:42,140
<font color="yellow"><i>Without knowing the whole truth</i></font>

439
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:49,120
<font color="yellow"><i>I fell in love with that guy.</i></font>

440
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm so mad that I want to kill everybody.</i></font>

441
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,210
<font color="yellow"><i>So badly...</i></font>

442
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,200
<font color="yellow"><i>So badly...</i></font>

443
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,370
<font color="yellow"><i>So badly...</i></font>

444
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,620
<font color="yellow"><i>So badly..</i>.</font>

445
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,270
<font color="yellow">You're all tangled together
in a ridiculous way.</font>

446
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,580
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

447
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,980
<font color="yellow">Isn't this something that could
make a headline in a foreign country?</font>

448
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,850
<font color="yellow">By the way, how did
Hae Young fall for that guy?</font>

449
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,660
<font color="yellow">Can't you guess?</font>

450
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,140
<font color="yellow">She was deceived.</font>

451
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that bastard was so nice
to her because he was guilty.</font>

452
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,910
<font color="yellow">He was getting ready for the time
when the truth would come out.</font>

453
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,120
<font color="yellow">- He made her fall for him.
- What did Hae Young say?</font>

454
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,600
<font color="yellow">What can she say?</font>

455
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,040
<font color="yellow">She's furious.</font>

456
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,370
<font color="yellow">Tae Jin.</font>

457
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,390
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

458
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,710
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

459
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,310
<font color="yellow"><i>[Oh Hae Young]</i></font>

460
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:05,480
<font color="yellow"><i>The phone is switched off
and your call is being redirected...</i></font>

461
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,560
<font color="yellow">Go bite his butt off.</font>

462
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,290
<font color="yellow">It sounds pretty.</font>

463
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,100
<font color="yellow">You had a delivery.
There was a knock on the door.</font>

464
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,080
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to ask if I'm okay?</font>

465
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,600
<font color="yellow">You can't be okay.</font>

466
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,200
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not okay.</font>

467
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,710
<font color="yellow">I'm a total wreck.</font>

468
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,680
<font color="yellow">I don't want to keep my eyes open.</font>

469
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,770
<font color="yellow">But I can't sleep.</font>

470
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,040
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep because I'm so mad.</font>

471
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,210
<font color="yellow">At the same time, I can't sleep
because I miss you.</font>

472
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,230
<font color="yellow">Now curse at me
and move on with your life.</font>

473
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,460
<font color="yellow">Get together with others
and curse at me.</font>

474
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,310
<font color="yellow">If you want to call and curse at me</font>

475
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,410
<font color="yellow">I will answer your calls every time.</font>

476
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,410
<font color="yellow">Call me any time.</font>

477
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,850
<font color="yellow">You can torture me.</font>

478
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,520
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want to do.</font>

479
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,120
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

480
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,730
<font color="yellow">Can you see me until I'm sick of you?</font>

481
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,330
<font color="yellow">Not until I'm sick of you...</font>

482
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,180
<font color="yellow">but until things become easier on me...</font>

483
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,230
<font color="yellow">Now everybody knows
and it's right to end it now.</font>

484
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,290
<font color="yellow">It's right to end it now, but...</font>

485
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,430
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can do it.</font>

486
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,520
<font color="yellow">If I break up with you now out of anger</font>

487
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,410
<font color="yellow">I may suffer for a long time.</font>

488
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,410
<font color="yellow">Can we just go out
for a bit and break up?</font>

489
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,100
<font color="yellow">Let's go out secretly
for a bit and break up.</font>

490
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

491
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,520
<font color="yellow">When I'm the only bad guy</font>

492
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,870
<font color="yellow">it's right to end it.</font>

493
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,520
<font color="yellow">Come out. I will drive you home.</font>

494
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,750
<font color="yellow">I will take you home.</font>

495
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,640
<font color="yellow">Get in. I will take you home.</font>

496
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,210
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations, Chairman Jang!
- Congratulations, Chairman Jang!</font>

497
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,430
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.</font>

498
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,100
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is good.</font>

499
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,480
<font color="yellow">- Oh my, thank you.
- Congratulations.</font>

500
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,020
<font color="yellow">- This is Mrs. Pang from Myungdong.
- Ah, hello.</font>

501
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,310
<font color="yellow">- And these are her friends.
- Congratulations.</font>

502
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:44,640
<font color="yellow">Hi, President Kim.
President Kim is in the wig business.</font>

503
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,620
<font color="yellow">Hello there.</font>

504
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,410
<font color="yellow">This is my father's fifth wedding.</font>

505
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,500
<font color="yellow">This is your mother's third wedding.</font>

506
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,520
<font color="yellow">My father beat her to it.</font>

507
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
<font color="yellow">How was your second stepfather?</font>

508
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,120
<font color="yellow">- He was nice.
- Was he really?</font>

509
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,660
<font color="yellow">He was.</font>

510
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,230
<font color="yellow">How do you think
your third stepfather will be?</font>

511
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,790
<font color="yellow">Why does it matter to me?</font>

512
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,000
<font color="yellow">Because money is involved.</font>

513
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,080
<font color="yellow">You're pretending, huh?</font>

514
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,810
<font color="yellow">My fifth stepmother
is the lousiest so far.</font>

515
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,850
<font color="yellow">I'm too embarrassed to call her mother.</font>

516
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,660
<font color="yellow">You've given up being a human being, huh?</font>

517
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,100
<font color="yellow">Just listen.</font>

518
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,290
<font color="yellow">When your mother is acting with a smile</font>

519
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:27,180
<font color="yellow">you can't mess it up as her son.</font>

520
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,960
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking so much, Do Kyung?</font>

521
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,410
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

522
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,410
<font color="yellow">You think I'll make it
uncomfortable for your mother?</font>

523
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,270
<font color="yellow">Why don't you congratulate me?</font>

524
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,940
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.
- Okay.</font>

525
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,960
<font color="yellow">It's hard to make you congratulate me.</font>

526
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,140
<font color="yellow">Young Joo, why don't you smile a bit?</font>

527
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,140
<font color="yellow">Don't give me that look.</font>

528
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,330
<font color="yellow">I told you not to be
bothered with my new wives.</font>

529
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,000
<font color="yellow">No matter how many wives
come and go, I won't change.</font>

530
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,140
<font color="yellow">You're the owner.</font>

531
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,230
<font color="yellow">You also know that, don't you?</font>

532
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,460
<font color="yellow">Smile, okay?</font>

533
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,960
<font color="yellow">The light pink looks so good on you.</font>

534
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,660
<font color="yellow">- Does it?
- I'm so happy now.</font>

535
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,160
<font color="yellow">- Are you?
- It's a perfect day too.</font>

536
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,930
<font color="yellow">- I agree.
- Don't you?</font>

537
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,960
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Please enjoy.</font>

538
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,680
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

539
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,210
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</font>

540
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,460
<font color="yellow">You look so good.</font>

541
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,410
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

542
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,350
<font color="yellow">- There you are.
- You smile too much.</font>

543
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,290
<font color="yellow">It's a happy day, you know.</font>

544
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,370
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you smile too?
- You know my father gets bored easily.</font>

545
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,230
<font color="yellow">When he gets bored,
he sends the signal.</font>

546
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,960
<font color="yellow">"Go give her a hard time.
I'm done with her."</font>

547
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,180
<font color="yellow">Then I go give her a hard time.</font>

548
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,640
<font color="yellow">And then we get into
a fight pulling hair.</font>

549
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,960
<font color="yellow">And then she gets kicked out.</font>

550
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,930
<font color="yellow">For some reason, I want to let you
know how it works this time.</font>

551
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,730
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling that it'll be so easy...</font>

552
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,950
<font color="yellow">for you to grab my hair
and get kicked out.</font>

553
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,020
<font color="yellow">Although it won't be fun
when it happens.</font>

554
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,180
<font color="yellow">What can I say?</font>

555
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,790
<font color="yellow">I'm a woman full of charms.</font>

556
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,790
<font color="yellow">It will take him a long time
to get bored with me.</font>

557
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,000
<font color="yellow">I hear both your ex-husbands passed away.</font>

558
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,460
<font color="yellow">And they had a lot of money too.</font>

559
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,330
<font color="yellow">I spent it all.</font>

560
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,640
<font color="yellow">I'm like a hippo that devours money.</font>

561
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,390
<font color="yellow">You didn't get investigated
after they passed away, huh?</font>

562
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,040
<font color="yellow">They both died so suddenly like that.</font>

563
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,480
<font color="yellow">I would have investigated right away.</font>

564
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,830
<font color="yellow">I'm a physician.</font>

565
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,000
<font color="yellow">If my father should die</font>

566
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,660
<font color="yellow">I would run all kinds of tests on him.</font>

567
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,770
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about it.</font>

568
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:00,020
<font color="yellow">I would kill you first.</font>

569
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,000
<font color="yellow">See if you can kill me first.</font>

570
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,580
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

571
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,770
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

572
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,620
<font color="yellow">- Don't be rude.
- Get up!</font>

573
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,950
<font color="yellow">- I said don't be rude.
- Go apologize to her.</font>

574
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,830
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

575
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,020
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me!
- Come here.</font>

576
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,200
<font color="yellow">- Let go!
- Apologize to her now!</font>

577
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,540
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Don't do it, Do Kyung.</font>

578
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,210
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Apologize to her.</font>

579
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,060
<font color="yellow">- How dare you two!
- Apologize!</font>

580
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,930
<font color="yellow">How dare you do that?</font>

581
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,930
<font color="yellow">How dare!</font>

582
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,930
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- How dare you say such a thing?</font>

583
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,390
<font color="yellow">- How dare you!
- What did you do just now?</font>

584
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,980
<font color="yellow">- You stop!
- Hey!</font>

585
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,210
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Let go of me!</font>

586
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,680
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

587
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,430
<font color="yellow">How dare you say such a thing?
How dare you!</font>

588
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,600
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

589
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

590
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,680
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

591
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,850
<font color="yellow">How could you do this?</font>

592
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:27,250
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard
it's been for me to get here?</font>

593
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,500
<font color="yellow">How could you ruin everything?</font>

594
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,140
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

595
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,290
<font color="yellow">Let's not live this way.</font>

596
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,790
<font color="yellow">Can we please not live this way?</font>

597
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,390
<font color="yellow">We live once.</font>

598
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,680
<font color="yellow">Let's not live this pathetically.</font>

599
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,600
<font color="yellow">Unless I bring back
your late father's fortune that I lost</font>

600
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,790
<font color="yellow">you won't treat me with respect.</font>

601
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,930
<font color="yellow">This is the only way I know
how to bring back that fortune.</font>

602
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,790
<font color="yellow">Isn't this the only way for me
to get that fortune back?</font>

603
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,390
<font color="yellow">It's okay not to have that kind of money.</font>

604
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,850
<font color="yellow">I hated the mother who always
wanted money all the time.</font>

605
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,020
<font color="yellow">I didn't hate the mother
who didn't have money!</font>

606
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,250
<font color="yellow">You bastard.</font>

607
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,410
<font color="yellow">What will you do with that punk?
Will you leave him alone?</font>

608
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,290
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

609
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,560
<font color="yellow">There is a way.</font>

610
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,620
<font color="yellow">Thank you. We will do our best.</font>

611
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,770
<font color="yellow">Thank you for trusting us, Chairman Jang.</font>

612
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,730
<font color="yellow">I invest when I see the potential.</font>

613
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,770
<font color="yellow">I pull out when I see otherwise.</font>

614
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,700
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

615
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:19,750
<font color="yellow">We will work hard not to let that happen.</font>

616
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,480
<font color="yellow">It's no fun to play by myself.</font>

617
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,770
<font color="yellow">- Play with me.
- I will.</font>

618
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,710
<font color="yellow">There you go!</font>

619
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,560
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead.
- Set go.</font>

620
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,160
<font color="yellow">- Wow!
- I did it!</font>

621
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,600
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

622
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,640
<font color="yellow">While President Han is trying
to expand his foreign market</font>

623
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,080
<font color="yellow">his partner seems to be
messing things up.</font>

624
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:00,290
<font color="yellow">He's increasing the sales by buying
his own merchandise on the web.</font>

625
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,210
<font color="yellow">He's been getting
loans from different places.</font>

626
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:06,310
<font color="yellow">But the sale volume
seems to be quite low.</font>

627
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,850
<font color="yellow">How do you want to
pull out your investment?</font>

628
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:14,520
<font color="yellow">Just pull it out.
No need to ask how.</font>

629
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,890
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so annoying.</font>

630
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,750
<font color="yellow">They are just a bunch of losers. Gosh!</font>

631
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,270
<font color="yellow">I just got back.</font>

632
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,120
<font color="yellow">I want to see Chairman Jang in person
and share this good news.</font>

633
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,620
<font color="yellow">It's President Han.</font>

634
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,980
<font color="yellow">- You didn't pull out our investment yet?
- We did.</font>

635
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,600
<font color="yellow">- He will soon find out.
- Tell him not to come by.</font>

636
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,230
<font color="yellow">No, tell him to come by.</font>

637
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,390
<font color="yellow">I will make him pay for this drink.</font>

638
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:52,660
<font color="yellow">How dare he tries to keep
my money for nothing?</font>

639
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,980
<font color="yellow">You can come to the place
where you came last time.</font>

640
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,040
<font color="yellow">When are you coming?</font>

641
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,310
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Hurry!</font>

642
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,180
<font color="yellow">To succeed in anything</font>

643
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,960
<font color="yellow">we should work with the right people.</font>

644
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,750
<font color="yellow">Someone I can trust, right?</font>

645
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,540
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

646
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,460
<font color="yellow">He's the one, Han Tae Jin.</font>

647
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,830
<font color="yellow">He's getting married to Oh Hae Young.</font>

648
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,230
<font color="yellow">Isn't he the one?</font>

649
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:45,100
<font color="yellow">He was in Europe with Oh Hae Young
on the day of your wedding.</font>

650
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,890
<font color="yellow">What are you, a saint?</font>

651
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,560
<font color="yellow">If you go over and say
something to Chairman Jang now</font>

652
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,520
<font color="yellow">you can have your revenge on him.
Why wouldn't you?</font>

653
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,560
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

654
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,810
<font color="yellow">I will do what you ask.</font>

655
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,870
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
I will pull out my investment.</font>

656
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,330
<font color="yellow">You will know how loyal I am
if you get to know me better.</font>

657
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,600
<font color="yellow">Who does he think he is?</font>

658
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:30,480
<font color="yellow">Why would I pull out millions
just because he asks me to?</font>

659
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,730
<font color="yellow">Go find out what Han Tae Jin is up to.</font>

660
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:37,060
<font color="yellow">He must be dying to have his revenge.</font>

661
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,210
<font color="yellow">- I will let him have it.
- Yes, Chairman Jang.</font>

666
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,410
<font color="yellow">I was so easy when it came to you.</font>

667
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,540
<font color="yellow">I came when you asked me to come.</font>

668
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,730
<font color="yellow">I left when you asked me to leave.</font>

669
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,460
<font color="yellow">I was that easy.</font>

670
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,910
<font color="yellow">How can it be this easy
to break up with me?</font>

671
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,870
<font color="yellow">How can you break up with me this easily?</font>

672
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,960
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

673
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:09,500

676
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,830
<font color="yellow">I want you to break down.</font>

677
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:41,620
<font color="yellow">I wish I'd die of depression
thinking about you.</font>

678
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,890
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

679
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,000
<font color="yellow">I want you to feel guilty
for the rest of your life.</font>

680

his forgiveness, shall we?</font>

681
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:58,640
<font color="yellow">There is nothing Chairman Jang can't do.</font>

682
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,640
<font color="yellow">Let's beg
for his forgiveness once, please.</font>

683
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,250
<font color="yellow">Please, Do Kyung.</font>

684
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,020
<font color="yellow">It's taken us longer, but...</font>

685
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,640
<font color="yellow">somehow we've ended up
back with the right people.</font>

686
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,450
<font color="yellow">My father is the owner of this house.</font>

687
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:25,210
<font color="yellow">I heard you wanted to buy this house.</font>

688
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,580
<font color="yellow">Do you perhaps still want to buy it?</font>

689
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,310
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

690
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:41,750
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to use the studio
your father used to use?</font>

691
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:46,000
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from the woman
who used to live here?</font>

692
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,180
<font color="yellow">Why would she call me?</font>

693
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,350
<font color="yellow">How did you like your blind date?</font>

694
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,850
<font color="yellow">- I didn't like her.
- You should see her again to be polite.</font>

695
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,310
<font color="yellow">You can't tell anything
after only seeing her once.</font>

696
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,750
<font color="yellow">One Oh Hae Young left the company.</font>

697
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,500
<font color="yellow">The other Oh Hae Young
still works at this company.</font>

698
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,540
<font color="yellow">Which Oh Hae Young
do you think has left?</font>

<font color="yellow">Which Oh Hae Young
do you think still works here?</font>

700
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,730
<font color="yellow">I don't want to know.</font>

701
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:19,430
<font color="yellow">Women don't badmouth
the men who left them.</font>

702
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,640
<font color="yellow">We badmouth the men who were cheap.</font>

703
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,460
<font color="yellow">Don't be cheap to anyone.</font>

704
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,060
<font color="yellow">Why were you nice to me?</font>

705
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,390
<font color="yellow">Because I felt bad for you.</font>

706
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,660
<font color="yellow">You were dumped
the day before your wedding.</font>

707
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,230
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stand watching you
tell everybody that you dumped him.</font>

708
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,120
<font color="yellow">That's why I was nice to you.
Is it a crime?</font>

709
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,180
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Beg.</font>

710
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,450
<font color="yellow">Beg.</font>

711
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,020
<font color="yellow">Beg! Come back and beg!</font>

712
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,290
<font color="yellow">- Are you seeing him again?
- Yes.</font>

713
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,120
<font color="yellow">- You're so easy, huh?
- Yes, I am easy.</font>

714
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,460
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to dislike you.</font>

715
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,980
<font color="yellow">You bastard.</font>

716
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,750
<font color="yellow">You're the cruelest man in the world!</font>

717
