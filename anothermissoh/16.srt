22
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. So sorry.</font>

23
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,000
<font color="yellow">Are you all right? Oh no...</font>

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,470
<font color="yellow">I must have scared you a lot.
I should've gone easier on you.</font>

25
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

26
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,850
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have done this
so early in the morning.</font>

27
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,620
<font color="yellow">Your heart mustn't have
completely woken up yet.</font>

28
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,310
<font color="yellow">I've scared you on top of that.</font>

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,600
<font color="yellow">I was trying to impress you,
but this has turned out weird.</font>

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,210
<font color="yellow">I can't stand up because I'm so touched.</font>

31
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,510
<font color="yellow">- How long have you been waiting?
- About 10 minutes?</font>

32
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,740
<font color="yellow">I told you I'll pick you up.
Why come all this way?</font>

33
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,370
<font color="yellow">I felt bad for acting fussy yesterday.</font>

34
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,230
<font color="yellow">I've come to you as a nice gesture.</font>

35
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,910
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about
what happened yesterday.</font>

36
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,780
<font color="yellow">I occasionally get mad and calm down
on my own over trivial things.</font>

37
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,270
<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't do that.
But I do, the more I like you.</font>

38
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,660
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- You've done nothing wrong.</font>

39
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,670
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

40
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,390
<font color="yellow">I'm not apologizing because I'm scared
you'd leave me for being fussy.</font>

41
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,090
<font color="yellow">I'm apologizing because
I truly think I've done wrong.</font>

42
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,780
<font color="yellow">This is how I am. I quickly apologize
for things that I've done wrong.</font>

43
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,080
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I got so lucky.</font>

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,260
<font color="yellow">Because I liked you first,
I snatched you up.</font>

45
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,640
<font color="yellow">- Don't tell that to other people.
- But it's true that I liked you first.</font>

46
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,700
<font color="yellow">I fell in love at first sight, chose you,
and made you mine.</font>

47
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,260
<font color="yellow">Aren't you proud of me?</font>

48
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,120
<font color="yellow">Thank you for falling in love
with me at first sight. Let's go.</font>

49
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,680
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't try to
surprise you ever again.</font>

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,340
<font color="yellow">Because you got so scared,
even I got scared.</font>

51
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,800
<font color="yellow">Don't do it to another woman. It's
dangerous. Especially not to my sister.</font>

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,570
<font color="yellow">She'd kill me.
I'd never do that to Director Park.</font>

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,060
<font color="yellow">- Get in.
- I love it. This gesture.</font>

54
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,490
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung. Hold up.</font>

55
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,040
<font color="yellow">Wait... I...</font>

56
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,500
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung. This isn't...</font>

57
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,240
<font color="yellow">Oh my. What are you doing?</font>

58
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,080
<font color="yellow">- Don't...
- Did you have a good time?</font>

59
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,860
<font color="yellow">Freaking Park Hoon! You scared me!</font>

60
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,680
<font color="yellow">I saw everything.
I saw you kissing Soo Kyung.</font>

61
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,170
<font color="yellow">- You were kissing for quite some time.
- Keep your mouth shut.</font>

62
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
<font color="yellow">Having a lawyer in the family.</font>

63
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,720
<font color="yellow">That makes me feel stronger,
Brother-in-law.</font>

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,000
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law?
Do you really want to die?</font>

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,770
<font color="yellow">You said you guys kissed.
Since you kissed, you'll get married.</font>

66
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,730
<font color="yellow">If you get married,
you'll be my brother-in-aw.</font>

67
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,290
<font color="yellow">You don't marry every woman you kiss.
I'd have married over a million times.</font>

68
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,750
<font color="yellow">You're being so old-fashioned.</font>

69
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,470
<font color="yellow">What is this? Then you won't marry her?</font>

70
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,000
<font color="yellow">I'm already cornered.
Don't push me further.</font>

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,090
<font color="yellow">Something really bad might happen then.</font>

72
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,120
<font color="yellow">I'm using more brain power now than
I did when I was studying for the bar.</font>

73
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,250
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to figure out
how to overcome this.</font>

74
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,280
<font color="yellow">I'm trying hard to
be logical and rational.</font>

75
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,100
<font color="yellow">If you keep making me mad like that</font>

76
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,770
<font color="yellow">I might resort to drowning
myself in a bowl of water!</font>

77
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,050
<font color="yellow"><i>- Calm down.
- Get out of my sight.</i></font>

78
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,660
<font color="yellow"><i>- Barging into my room this early...
- Fine. I got it.</i></font>

79
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,640
<font color="yellow"><i>- Get out of my sight! Right now!
- All right. Fine.</i></font>

80
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Look at him! Look at him!
Idiot Jin Sang kissed</i></font>

81
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Park Soo Kyung!</i></font>

82
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,480
<font color="yellow">- Park Hoon. Come out.
- I didn't disrespect him.</font>

83
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,280
<font color="yellow">- I didn't say any mean things, right?
- Come out!</font>

84
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,100
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard to drown yourself
in a bowl of water.</font>

85
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,230
<font color="yellow">Take your time to think it over.</font>

86
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,170
<font color="yellow">I'm done thinking about it.</font>

87
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,700
<font color="yellow">Once you've made your decision,
we can each share our thoughts then.</font>

88
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,200
<font color="yellow">What did you decide to do?</font>

89
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,460
<font color="yellow">Let's talk once
you've made your decision.</font>

90
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,030
<font color="yellow">So what decision have you arrived at?
Can't you tell me first?</font>

91
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,400
<font color="yellow">I can't make a decision.
I never could.</font>

92
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,570
<font color="yellow">Someone please make one for me.</font>

93
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,640
<font color="yellow">Just tell her the truth.
About everything.</font>

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,030
<font color="yellow">"I've seen my last dying moment."</font>

95
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,310
<font color="yellow">"Because my feelings
for you were so strong"</font>

96
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,510
<font color="yellow">"it has pierced time
and revealed itself in the present."</font>

97
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,340
<font color="yellow">"So I've known about you
even before we actually met."</font>

98
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,120
<font color="yellow">If she can't believe you,
I'll talk to her.</font>

99
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,110
<font color="yellow">I'll say, "It might be hard to believe,
but this kind of stuff happens."</font>

100
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,600
<font color="yellow">I'll tell her everything.</font>

101
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,940
<font color="yellow">After that...</font>

102
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,920
<font color="yellow">you can try to
formulate a plan with her.</font>

103
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,380
<font color="yellow">Tell her, "Han Tae Jin is trying to
kill me because he is pissed."</font>

104
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,410
<font color="yellow">"So what should I do?
The only way to save my life is this."</font>

105
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,430
<font color="yellow">"Let's pretend thaht we broke up."</font>

106
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,280
<font color="yellow">"Then he won't have
a reason to kill me."</font>

107
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,440
<font color="yellow">"Let's pretend that we've broken up
and date again later."</font>

108
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,340
<font color="yellow">What are you even saying?</font>

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,490
<font color="yellow">We somehow need to save his life first.</font>

110
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,450
<font color="yellow">Your logic makes no sense.</font>

111
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,570
<font color="yellow">In his current vision,
he's broken up with that woman.</font>

112
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,190
<font color="yellow">So even if they weren't dating,
that man would've tried to kill him.</font>

113
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,060
<font color="yellow">- Is that right?
- Wait outside.</font>

114
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,990
<font color="yellow">This is so hard.
I don't know what's right.</font>

115
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,690
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

116
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,570
<font color="yellow">I feel at ease. Very surprisingly so.</font>

117
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,400
<font color="yellow">Then you're going down the right path.</font>

118
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,050
<font color="yellow">Don't be nervous.
If you get nervous, you'll get scared.</font>

119
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,210
<font color="yellow">Your current situations are all
consequences of your past actions.</font>

120
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,400
<font color="yellow">You're facing the consequences of</font>

121
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,690
<font color="yellow">neglecting those actions
out of fear and anxiety.</font>

122
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,230
<font color="yellow">These circumstances will repeat
themselves until you turn to love.</font>

123
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,770
<font color="yellow">Once you turn to love, because you've
learned everything you were supposed to</font>

124
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,440
<font color="yellow">those similar situations will delete
themselves from your life scenario.</font>

125
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,570
<font color="yellow">And that's why
your scenario is changing.</font>

126
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,500
<font color="yellow">You've seen how it has changed, right?</font>

127
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,300
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

128
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,100
<font color="yellow">I told you to not greet me
when we run into each other.</font>

129
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,230
<font color="yellow">Change out of those shoes.</font>

130
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,260
<font color="yellow">Your footsteps sound uncomfortable.</font>

131
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,780
<font color="yellow">Holding myself back from wanting to
embrace you has made me sick.</font>

132
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry.
But this is how I genuinely feel.</i></font>

133
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,950
<font color="yellow">If you turn to fear,
your scenario won't change.</font>

134
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,480
<font color="yellow">Relax and go all the way.</font>

135
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,010
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about your ending too.</font>

136
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,780
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you again.
- All right.</font>

137
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,120
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to sway him?
He's going down the right path.</font>

138
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,370
<font color="yellow">Is the drifting sound in sync
with the video?</font>

139
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,980
<font color="yellow">I'll be there soon.
I'll take a look at it myself. Okay.</font>

140
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,000
<font color="yellow">Here is what you've ordered.</font>

141
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,690
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

142
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,550
<font color="yellow">You used to say carrying
a bouquet of flowers is embarrassing.</font>

143
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,540
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?
Are you okay?</font>

144
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,190
<font color="yellow">It's nothing serious.</font>

145
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,830
<font color="yellow">You also used to say
you hate a woman who cries.</font>

146
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,500
<font color="yellow">But Hae Young cries a lot.</font>

147
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,790
<font color="yellow">I get it. I know she's different.</font>

148
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,040
<font color="yellow">A fearlessly honest woman like
Hae Young is perfect for you.</font>

149
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,810
<font color="yellow">A woman who could love you
passionately and shamelessly.</font>

150
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,640
<font color="yellow">A woman like that suits you.</font>

151
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,620
<font color="yellow">You two are a good match.
Congratulations.</font>

152
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,730
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

153
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,470
<font color="yellow">I'm purposely acting cool because
I want to be remembered as a nice woman.</font>

154
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,940
<font color="yellow">I'm just kidding. Let's head up.</font>

155
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,630
<font color="yellow">Don't you think Assistant Manager Oh
got so much prettier these days?</font>

156
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,300
<font color="yellow">Assistant Manger Oh isn't that pretty.</font>

157
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,460
<font color="yellow">- I mean she is pretty. But...
- Who's the prettiest?</font>

158
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,080
<font color="yellow">- Let's not talk about this.
- Ms. Oh, you're the prettiest.</font>

159
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,270
<font color="yellow">You always take things too far.</font>

160
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,720
<font color="yellow">You always freeload on others.</font>

161
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,350
<font color="yellow">What's with these flowers?</font>

162
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,370
<font color="yellow">Can I let my heart flutter?</font>

163
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,500
<font color="yellow">Usually...</font>

164
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,450
<font color="yellow">if there are flowers on my desk, I think</font>

165
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,020
<font color="yellow">"It has come to the wrong person again.
It should've been given to Manager Oh."</font>

166
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,370
<font color="yellow">That's what I used to think.</font>

167
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,130
<font color="yellow">But this one just feels like...</font>

168
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,140
<font color="yellow">it's mine.</font>

169
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,570
<font color="yellow">It doesn't even have a card!</font>

170
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,790
<font color="yellow">If it was dropped off by a delivery man,
it should have a card!</font>

171
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,080
<font color="yellow">If this was... If this was...</font>

172
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,630
<font color="yellow">If it was dropped off by that man,
I could do anything today!</font>

173
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,840
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought you'd cause a scene.
So I'm just dropping the flowers off.</i></font>

174
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,760
<font color="yellow">He came all this way!
He should've showed me his face.</font>

175
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I refuse your text reply.
I'm too embarrassed.</i></font>

176
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Aren't I better than Jang Gook Young?</i></font>

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,810
<font color="yellow">So much better.</font>

178
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,810
<font color="yellow">This bouquet of flowers is mine.</font>

179
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,110
<font color="yellow"><i>Wear your employee badge properly.</i></font>

180
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,600
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?</font>

181
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,540
<font color="yellow">It hurts the most right now.</font>

182
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,120
<font color="yellow">You know how this part hurts the most.</font>

183
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,420
<font color="yellow">This makes me sweat.</font>

184
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,840
<font color="yellow">So nice.</font>

185
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,380
<font color="yellow">I want to enjoy this moment on my own.</font>

186
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,270
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. Come on.
- I'm jealous.</font>

187
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,610
<font color="yellow">His recording studio will be
seized today or tomorrow.</font>

188
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,050
<font color="yellow">And what else?</font>

189
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,780
<font color="yellow">Don't you have more stuff coming?</font>

190
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,780
<font color="yellow">You're only taking
a building away from him?</font>

191
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,280
<font color="yellow">His house isn't on the market yet.</font>

192
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
<font color="yellow">You're so cool.</font>

193
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,460
<font color="yellow">I heard your company hit big
once you lost your ownership.</font>

194
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,840
<font color="yellow">So you just did all that work
for your partner?</font>

195
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,700
<font color="yellow">Then you're done after
taking a building away?</font>

196
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,390
<font color="yellow">You're so cool. That's fine then.</font>

197
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,160
<font color="yellow">I can stop feeling sorry
for you now then, right?</font>

198
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,050
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't taken my money away</font>

199
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,710
<font color="yellow">after just listening to Park Do Kyung</font>

200
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,420
<font color="yellow">you'd be driving
a nice car with a chauffeur.</font>

201
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,660
<font color="yellow">You'd be living the life.</font>

202
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,680
<font color="yellow">I just felt bad because
I thought it was all my fault.</font>

203
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,500
<font color="yellow">So I tried to help you out.</font>

204
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,890
<font color="yellow">But if this is enough for you,
then that's good enough for me.</font>

205
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,780
<font color="yellow">Wow. You have such a big heart.</font>

206
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,330
<font color="yellow">- I'll look further into it.
- No. Don't if you don't want to.</font>

207
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,180
<font color="yellow">If you feel all better now,
then that's enough.</font>

208
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,950
<font color="yellow">I'll look for something more.</font>

209
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,020
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

210
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,840
<font color="yellow">As a man</font>

211
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,940
<font color="yellow">you need to knock the other man down.
Don't just jab at him.</font>

212
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,980
<font color="yellow">Fly lightly like a butterfly
and sting like a bee!</font>

213
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,500
<font color="yellow">Leave. I want to rest.</font>

214
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,110
<font color="yellow">Let me be clear with you.</font>

215
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,690
<font color="yellow">I didn't take my investments away
because you were up to something dirty.</font>

216
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,720
<font color="yellow">I took them away because
Park Do Kyung asked me to.</font>

217
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,680
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

218
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,430
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

219
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,860
<font color="yellow">If you leave right now,
you'll run into Han Tae Jin!</font>

220
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,740
<font color="yellow">He's not fit to run a business.</font>

221
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,480
<font color="yellow">He's a scaredy-cat.</font>

222
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,400
<font color="yellow">Quickly take your money
and make a run for it.</font>

223
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,920
<font color="yellow">Run while you can.</font>

224
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,280
<font color="yellow">I'm home!</font>

225
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,000
<font color="yellow">We have rice.</font>

226
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,220
<font color="yellow">We have carrots.
I thought we had stir-fried anchovies.</font>

227
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,560
<font color="yellow">Here they are.</font>

228
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,780
<font color="yellow">Let's see. Burdocks.
Mom, don't we have burdocks?</font>

229
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,500
<font color="yellow">I need burdocks. Burdocks.</font>

230
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,830
<font color="yellow">Let's see. We have dried seaweed.</font>

231
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,060
<font color="yellow">How could we not have burdocks?
I don't get it.</font>

232
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,850
<font color="yellow">Sesame oil. Here.</font>

233
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
<font color="yellow">We have sesame oil.
I need a bowl.</font>

234
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,620
<font color="yellow">A bowl. Here it is.</font>

235
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,080
<font color="yellow">That's strange.
Why don't we have burdocks?</font>

236
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,690
<font color="yellow">I just don't get it.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>On May 22, 1985</i></font>

You should've showed your face.</font>

Come in and have some.</font>

279
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,850

289
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,300
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hey.</font>

290
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,520
<font color="yellow">Is she the one? It is her.</font>

291
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,310
<font color="yellow">What did you tell her?
Why is she acting this way?</font>

292
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, kid. You don't have to look at me
like that. I don't care about your man.</font>

293
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,860
<font color="yellow">He told me you tried to seduce him.</font>

294
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,780
<font color="yellow">How could I ever ask you
to work together again?</font>

295
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,690
<font color="yellow">You're getting angry. So it was true.</font>

296
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,690
<font color="yellow">- How old are you?
- Hold on.</font>

297
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,920
<font color="yellow">Hello? Yes. Director.</font>

298
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,400
<font color="yellow">Talking about age will
put you at a disadvantage.</font>

299
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,680
<font color="yellow">You're quite the talker. Keep going.</font>

300
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,110
<font color="yellow">You know it'll just make you look funny
if you stop working with him now, right?</font>

301
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,070
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem like you tried to
seduce him because you needed a man.</font>

302
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,700
<font color="yellow">I trust that you'll work with him
like a professional.</font>

303
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,130
<font color="yellow">If you can't trust my Hoon</font>

304
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,690
<font color="yellow">then come do work at
the coffee shop I work at.</font>

305
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,750
<font color="yellow">From hearing you talk, it seems like
you're better than your boyfriend.</font>

306
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,590
<font color="yellow">Sounds like you don't know
my Hoon very well.</font>

307
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,520
<font color="yellow">But my Hoon is freaking good-looking.</font>

308
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,410
<font color="yellow">How shocking.</font>

309
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,020
<font color="yellow">You have a nice girlfriend.</font>

310
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,820
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the coffee shop!</font>

311
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

312
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,990
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

313
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,080
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung likes melons.</font>

314
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,810
<font color="yellow">You think you're Joo Yoon Bal?
Stop trying to act cool.</font>

315
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,690
<font color="yellow">You do some crazy shit.
But I liked how you used to never smoke.</font>

316
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,010
<font color="yellow">Did the results for
the bar exam come out?</font>

317
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:05,300
<font color="yellow">I heard it's impossible to
pass that on your first try.</font>

318
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,560
<font color="yellow">They'll have one next year too.</font>

319
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,900
<font color="yellow">I've been drafted.</font>

320
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,400
<font color="yellow">Perfect timing, right?</font>

321
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,880
<font color="yellow">How could it come right after
I failed the bar exam?</font>

322
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,810
<font color="yellow">If I try to study for it
after my service</font>

323
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,600
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to.
I'd be stupid by then.</font>

324
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,470
<font color="yellow">You can't postpone it any longer, right?</font>

325
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,730
<font color="yellow">I must go.</font>

326
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,950
<font color="yellow">Men have things that they must do
even if they don't want to.</font>

327
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,670
<font color="yellow">There are things a man must endure.</font>

328
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,760
<font color="yellow">So I'll serve.</font>

329
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,710
<font color="yellow">But I was hoping</font>

330
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,390
<font color="yellow">maybe this one cigarette would</font>

331
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,680
<font color="yellow">make me feel a little better.</font>

332
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,360
<font color="yellow">Don't breathe it in too deeply.</font>

333
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,500
<font color="yellow">If a new smoker breathes in too deeply,
this might happen.</font>

334
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,370
<font color="yellow">Jin Sang? Jin Sang?</font>

335
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,070
<font color="yellow">I'm causing all this trouble...</font>

336
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,110
<font color="yellow">but I just don't feel excited.</font>

337
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,610
<font color="yellow">Because someone is helping me,
it's all going smoothly.</font>

338
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,710
<font color="yellow">But I just can't get excited.</font>

339
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,970
<font color="yellow">How could anyone feel excited
about ruining someone's life?</font>

340
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,770
<font color="yellow">If it bothers you that much,
you should stop it.</font>

341
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,180
<font color="yellow">Almost everyone who matters knows.</font>

342
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,300
<font color="yellow">The fact that I went to prison
because of Park Do Kyung.</font>

343
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,900
<font color="yellow">After getting released,
I see he even took my woman.</font>

344
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,720
<font color="yellow">Everyone is waiting to see
what I'm going to do next.</font>

345
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,000
<font color="yellow">But if I stop right here...</font>

346
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,960
<font color="yellow">I want to get votes from everyone.</font>

347
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,350
<font color="yellow">About what I should do.</font>

348
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,730
<font color="yellow">I vote for stopping here.</font>

349
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,530
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the meal.
It was delicious.</font>

350
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,140
<font color="yellow">Leave it. They say it's heartless
to clean dishes right away.</font>

351
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,240
<font color="yellow">By the way.
Where's my stand and music box?</font>

352
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,450
<font color="yellow">Over there in the shopping bag.
Untouched.</font>

353
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,830
<font color="yellow">It was childish, wasn't it?
Giving back your gifts.</font>

354
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,710
<font color="yellow">It was just to show how mad I was.</font>

355
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,490
<font color="yellow">I also thought they'd
make me think about you.</font>

356
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,210
<font color="yellow">Did you have something to do
near my workplace today?</font>

357
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,030
<font color="yellow">What were the flowers for?
You saw me in the morning.</font>

358
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,400
<font color="yellow">Seeing flowers just reminded me of you.</font>

359
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,160
<font color="yellow">Park Do Kyung is on a roll.</font>

360
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,000
<font color="yellow">If you like me this much,
how were you holding back all this time?</font>

361
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,860
<font color="yellow">I'm going to brush my teeth.</font>

362
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,730
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go brush my teeth.</font>

363
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,480
<font color="yellow">I'm going to brush my teeth.
Brush my teeth.</font>

364
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,250
<font color="yellow">As I was leaving work,
I felt bad leaving my flowers behind.</font>

365
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,820
<font color="yellow">It felt like I was leaving you behind.</font>

366
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,910
<font color="yellow">Just imagining it staying in
our dark office by itself</font>

367
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,400
<font color="yellow">made me feel like you're the one
sitting at a dark desk by yourself.</font>

368
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,550
<font color="yellow">How are you going to
look at it while it wilts?</font>

369
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,360
<font color="yellow">Just imagining it makes my heart ache.</font>

370
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,500
<font color="yellow">Don't take things too far.</font>

371
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,610
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't.</font>

372
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,640
<font color="yellow">By the way, you aren't still
addressing me correctly.</font>

373
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,920
<font color="yellow">I'll call you by both names.</font>

374
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,280
<font color="yellow">I just never had called anyone "Honey."</font>

375
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,610
<font color="yellow">So gross.</font>

376
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,580
<font color="yellow"><i>Park Do Kyung, the good days are over.</i></font>

377
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,270
<font color="yellow"><i>Starting tomorrow,
there will be some trouble.</i></font>

378
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,190
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?
- The driving service.</font>

379
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,530
<font color="yellow">Come over here.</font>

380
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,140
<font color="yellow">- The first, second, and third.
- Try it.</font>

381
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,100
<font color="yellow">Second one...</font>

382
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,670
<font color="yellow">Men who are good with machines
are always so attractive.</font>

383
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,270
<font color="yellow">Why did you fall in love
with me at first sight?</font>

384
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,690
<font color="yellow">How would I know that?
I don't know why.</font>

385
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,450
<font color="yellow">People say you just recognize the person
you're going to fall in love with.</font>

386
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,780
<font color="yellow">You don't fall in love with
that person just because</font>

387
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,350
<font color="yellow">they were nice to you or something.</font>

388
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,750
<font color="yellow">Just... At first sight.</font>

389
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,190
<font color="yellow">You recognize it.</font>

390
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,600
<font color="yellow">As soon as I saw you,
I wanted to barge into your heart</font>

391
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
<font color="yellow">and spread myself out.</font>

392
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,600
<font color="yellow">I wanted to remove anything
that was making you unhappy</font>

393
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,690
<font color="yellow">and light up your heart with warmth.</font>

394
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,150
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be
the only one sitting in it.</font>

395
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,710
<font color="yellow">- Did I seem unhappy to you?
- Yes. Extremely.</font>

396
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,050
<font color="yellow">From your head to toes.</font>

397
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,480
<font color="yellow">So I couldn't just leave you behind.</font>

398
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,890
<font color="yellow">- Like your cans?
- Cans are pitiful.</font>

399
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,600
<font color="yellow">But you looked unhappy.</font>

400
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,540
<font color="yellow">So you fell in love at first sight
with me because I looked unhappy.</font>

401
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,240
<font color="yellow">I must have been unhappy too.</font>

402
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,830
<font color="yellow">"I'm unhappy too."</font>

403
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,990
<font color="yellow">"I'll make you happy."</font>

404
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,990
<font color="yellow">"Let's be happy together."</font>

405
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,800
<font color="yellow">But you played hard to get!</font>

406
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,360
<font color="yellow">Is that what all good-looking men do?</font>

407
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,890
<font color="yellow">Here you go again with
your handsomeness!</font>

408
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,300
<font color="yellow">I wish you would age quickly</font>

409
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,270
<font color="yellow">and become an old grandpa.</font>

410
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,540
<font color="yellow">So that I'm the only woman...</font>

411
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,080
<font color="yellow">who finds Park Do Kyung attractive.</font>

412
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,560
<font color="yellow">So that no one even
looks in your direction.</font>

413
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,890
<font color="yellow">And I wish you would get chubbier.</font>

414
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,990
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

415
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,490
<font color="yellow">I could get chubby
and you could get older.</font>

416
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,560
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

417
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,140
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

418
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,740
<font color="yellow">What do you need?</font>

419
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,950
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

420
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,490
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

421
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,310
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

422
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,970
<font color="yellow">I asked what happened!</font>

423
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,510
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

424
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,680
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

425
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,010
<font color="yellow">Do Kyung.</font>

426
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,050
<font color="yellow">- I'm on the phone. Get out.
- Do Kyung!</font>

427
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,180
<font color="yellow">I said get out!</font>

428
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,760
<font color="yellow">Hey, so Do Kyung already knew about this?</font>

429
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,330
<font color="yellow">It seems that way.</font>

430
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,490
<font color="yellow">He knew about it.</font>

431
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,300
<font color="yellow">Take all four of them.</font>

432
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,030
<font color="yellow">They are good at what they do.</font>

433
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,120
<font color="yellow">Take all four of them, please.</font>

434
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,680
<font color="yellow">I will give you all the equipment too.</font>

435
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,810
<font color="yellow">Instead, you can't give them a pay cut.</font>

436
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,200
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

437
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,780
<font color="yellow">You don't need anyone for the office?</font>

438
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,930
<font color="yellow">It's you, isn't it?</font>

439
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,550
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

440
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,720
<font color="yellow">Is it our first time with a deal?</font>

441
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,530
<font color="yellow">I've been late with my payments,
but I always paid you back.</font>

442
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,280
<font color="yellow">- Why are you suddenly acting this way?
- Ma'am.</font>

443
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,450
<font color="yellow">I was offered more,
so I had no choice but to sell it.</font>

444
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,950
<font color="yellow">You sold my debt?</font>

445
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,310
<font color="yellow">Whom did you sell it to?</font>

446
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,350
<font color="yellow">The guy who was pissed off at your son
paid more and bought it.</font>

447
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,680
<font color="yellow">So who is that guy?</font>

448
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,990
<font color="yellow">- Is it CEO Jang?
- No.</font>

449
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,510
<font color="yellow">He used to do so well with his business.</font>

450
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,600
<font color="yellow">He went bankrupt and was sent to prison.</font>

451
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,140
<font color="yellow">Your son did that to him
because of a woman.</font>

452
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,410
<font color="yellow">I heard it was recently on the radio.</font>

453
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,740
<font color="yellow">- Her name was Oh Hae Young.
- Oh Hae Young?</font>

454
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,780
<font color="yellow">You came. Hey, Park Hoon.</font>

455
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,550
<font color="yellow">They even placed his property
under distraint attachment?</font>

456
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,760
<font color="yellow">Han Tae Jin is playing
badly, unlike his build.</font>

457
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,870
<font color="yellow">Go do something to Do Kyung.</font>

458
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,870
<font color="yellow">He's not doing anything.</font>

459
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,160
<font color="yellow">We will appeal the decision first.</font>

460
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,350
<font color="yellow">We will buy some time
and get money in the meantime.</font>

461
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,180
<font color="yellow">Just leave it. It's the right thing
to get it all taken away.</font>

462
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,580
<font color="yellow">- Do Kyung.
- You know what I did to him.</font>

463
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,740
<font color="yellow">But you still need to do
whatever you can.</font>

464
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,640
<font color="yellow">It seems that Han Tae Jin
and CEO Jang are working together.</font>

465
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,470
<font color="yellow">CEO Jang has more power
than your legal advice.</font>

466
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,720
<font color="yellow">So don't even try to help me out.</font>

467
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,080
<font color="yellow">I deserve to die.</font>

468
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:39,100
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't talked you into having
your revenge on him back then</font>

469
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,580
<font color="yellow">things wouldn't have come to this.</font>

470
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,980
<font color="yellow">I seriously deserve to die.</font>

471
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,960
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

472
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,980
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

473
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,700
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't talked me into doing that</font>

474
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,020
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have met Hae Young.</font>

475
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,390
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

476
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,020
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

477
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,540
<font color="yellow">you're the one who threw the dart.</font>

478
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,060
<font color="yellow">What's the occasion that
you're taking me out to lunch?</font>

479
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,160
<font color="yellow">Well, no reason.</font>

480
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,640
<font color="yellow">I wanted to thank you for saving
my letter for 13 years.</font>

481
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,790
<font color="yellow">You know that
I've moved around a lot, right?</font>

482
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,410
<font color="yellow">I even went abroad.</font>

483
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,810
<font color="yellow">I brought that letter every time.</font>

484
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,120
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

485
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,480
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- About what?</font>

486
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,370
<font color="yellow">I hated you for a long time.</font>

487
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,830
<font color="yellow">When I think about it</font>

488
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,000
<font color="yellow">you didn't do me any harm.</font>

489
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,960
<font color="yellow">Because we had the same name</font>

490
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,250
<font color="yellow">it was the boys' fault that
they praised you and put me down.</font>

491
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,060
<font color="yellow">If we'd had different names</font>

492
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,620
<font color="yellow">- we'd have been quite close.
- No way.</font>

493
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,200
<font color="yellow">Pretty girls are friends
with only the pretty ones.</font>

494
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,700
<font color="yellow">You're very pretty.</font>

495
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,290
<font color="yellow">This is why I hate you.</font>

496
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,080
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

497
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,700
<font color="yellow">- Take this bacon.
- Thanks for the food.</font>

498
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,270
<font color="yellow">Where did you buy those shoes?</font>

499
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,500
<font color="yellow">- Those are designer shoes, aren't they?
- No, I got them cheap on the Internet.</font>

500
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,930
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to know the website?
- Please.</font>

501
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,350
<font color="yellow">I'm good at finding good deals.</font>

502
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,310
<font color="yellow">You bitch!</font>

503
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,480
<font color="yellow">How can you possibly
walk around with a smile on?</font>

504
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,410
<font color="yellow">You ruined my son's life.</font>

505
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,520
<font color="yellow">You walk around smiling?</font>

506
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,180
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?
Stop it before I call the police.</font>

507
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,810
<font color="yellow">Call the police.
So I can have her arrested!</font>

508
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,060
<font color="yellow">Once you're separated,
that should be the end of it.</font>

509
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,870
<font color="yellow">Why did you show up again
to ruin Do Kyung's life, huh?</font>

510
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:04,710
<font color="yellow">Do you even know the man you
almost married is ruining his life?</font>

511
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,020
<font color="yellow">Do you know or not?</font>

512
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,040
<font color="yellow">Go. Just go.</font>

513
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,770
<font color="yellow">- Where do you think you're going?
- Stop it. It's not her.</font>

514
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,640
<font color="yellow">- Just go.
- You bitch!</font>

515
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,870
<font color="yellow">I asked you to stop.</font>

516
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,890
<font color="yellow">- Who the heck are you?
- It's me, not her.</font>

517
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,560
<font color="yellow">What? What are you saying?</font>

518
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,430
<font color="yellow"><i>[Oh Hae Young]</i></font>

519
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,330
<font color="yellow">He thought this one was you...</font>

520
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,540
<font color="yellow">So who is currently seeing whom?</font>

521
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,000
<font color="yellow">Me and Do Kyung...</font>

522
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:53,290
<font color="yellow">Then what's the relationship
between these two?</font>

523
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,750
<font color="yellow">They have no relationship.</font>

524
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,770
<font color="yellow">Now I understand.</font>

525
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,580
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

526
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,460
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Do Kyung?</font>

527
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,480
<font color="yellow">His taste in women is
getting worse and worse...</font>

528
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:14,230
<font color="yellow">You don't look like your family is rich.</font>

529
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,020
<font color="yellow">Did you do well in school?</font>

530
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,500
<font color="yellow">You... are excited, aren't you?</font>

531
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,000
<font color="yellow">You can't think straight
because two men are fighting over you.</font>

532
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,790
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

533
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,790
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are we going to do with you?</font>

534
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:44,480
<font color="yellow">You should stick to your own league.</font>

535
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,410
<font color="yellow">If your head gets too big
and you dare to cross over</font>

536
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,640
<font color="yellow">you will get hurt.</font>

537
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,080
<font color="yellow">What you're doing now
is in a different league.</font>

538
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,870
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I'm trying to say?</font>

539
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,950
<font color="yellow">I won't have to make a speech.</font>

540
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:06,370
<font color="yellow">You don't look like someone
who will make it hard to forget.</font>

541
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:11,640
<font color="yellow">So don't drag this out
longer than it should be.</font>

542
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,540
<font color="yellow">Go back to the man you almost married.</font>

543
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,310
<font color="yellow">Then everything will be taken care of.</font>

544
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,960
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering?</font>

545
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,390
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Seriously!</font>

546
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,250
<font color="yellow">You must be one of those who don't talk!</font>

547
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,160
<font color="yellow">If you really care about Do Kyung</font>

548
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,370
<font color="yellow">it's right to just get out of his life.</font>

549
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,520
<font color="yellow">Are you with him to watch him die, huh?</font>

550
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:48,870
<font color="yellow">Even if the man doesn't say anything...</font>

551
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:54,930
<font color="yellow">even if he says it's okay and to stay
with him because he loves you</font>

552
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,810
<font color="yellow">the woman should be wise enough
to know at a time like this</font>

553
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:04,660
<font color="yellow">and be the first one
to say goodbye to him.</font>

554
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,310
<font color="yellow">Don't you watch movies?</font>

555
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,060
<font color="yellow">That's what love is.</font>

556
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,100
<font color="yellow">You call that man.</font>

557
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,230
<font color="yellow">Tell him that you broke up with
Do Kyung and will come back to him.</font>

558
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,020
<font color="yellow">Call him.</font>

559
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,870
<font color="yellow">I said call him!</font>

560
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,020
<font color="yellow">You'd better call him.</font>

561
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,460
<font color="yellow">- What are you looking at?
- Isn't it time to quit?</font>

562
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,750
<font color="yellow">This is not your place.</font>

563
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,370
<font color="yellow">Why would his ex-girlfriend get involved?</font>

564
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,750
<font color="yellow">Do Kyung is the most kind man.</font>

565
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,460
<font color="yellow">Other sons would have left you long ago.</font>

566
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,700
<font color="yellow">Crazy bitch. Hey.</font>

567
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,580
<font color="yellow">I've been saying this all along.</font>

568
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,680
<font color="yellow">Blood is thicker than water.</font>

569
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,370
<font color="yellow">Plus, don't you feel guilty?</font>

570
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,960
<font color="yellow">This whole thing started because of you.</font>

571
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,410
<font color="yellow">I started half
and you did the other half.</font>

572
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,710
<font color="yellow">Half and half?</font>

573
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,770
<font color="yellow">I may go somewhere
to have an exorcism done.</font>

574
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,600
<font color="yellow">Why are so many Oh Hae Youngs
entangled in our lives?</font>

575
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,160
<font color="yellow">Mom used a private loan
without telling you, didn't she?</font>

576
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,850
<font color="yellow">And she put you down
as a guarantor, didn't she?</font>

577
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,910
<font color="yellow">It's not her fault.</font>

578
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting this way?</font>

579
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,790
<font color="yellow">- Why are you taking her side?
- It's seriously not her fault.</font>

580
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,980
<font color="yellow">I spoke to someone at Sori Sound.</font>

581
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,730
<font color="yellow">They will have you continue to work
on our project and give you jobs there.</font>

582
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,600
<font color="yellow">- Bullshit!
- Seriously?</font>

583
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,930
<font color="yellow">You think we're doing this
because we can't find a job elsewhere?</font>

584
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,060
<font color="yellow">You thought we stayed
around here all these years</font>

585
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,350
<font color="yellow">and were all happy about
working for such a difficult boss?</font>

586
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,120
<font color="yellow">Because it was you, Park Do Kyung.</font>

587
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,450
<font color="yellow">Even if it was very tough
in the beginning</font>

588
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:17,660
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd learn more
because it's you.</font>

589
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,180
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd learn more things.</font>

590
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:25,890
<font color="yellow">And later, I started to like
who you were and stayed.</font>

591
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,830
<font color="yellow">Should I cry now?</font>

592
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,200
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

593
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,450
<font color="yellow">As much as we cared about you</font>

594
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,870
<font color="yellow">you didn't care about us.</font>

595
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,540
<font color="yellow">We can rent a place
and start over together.</font>

596
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,930
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to work for a while.</font>

597
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,000
<font color="yellow">You won't or you can't?</font>

598
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,080
<font color="yellow">You go to the army.</font>

599
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,730
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

600
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,290
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with
a woman for the first time?</font>

601
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,020
<font color="yellow">He's smiling.</font>

602
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,660
<font color="yellow">He's not telling the truth.</font>

603
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,450
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how I am?</font>

604
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,370
<font color="yellow">You bastard, seriously.</font>

605
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,100
<font color="yellow">How much did their check come out to be?</font>

606
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,640
<font color="yellow">It came out to be 78,000.</font>

607
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,770
<font color="yellow">Charge it 300,000.</font>

608
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,980
<font color="yellow">I wanted to pay for your drinks.</font>

609
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,350
<font color="yellow">I bet you don't have much money.</font>

610
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,120
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

611
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,480
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the drinks.
- Thank you.</font>

612
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,060
<font color="yellow">- Who is he?
- Sang Suk.</font>

613
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,180
<font color="yellow">- Didn't he come by the studio before?
- I think he did.</font>

614
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,910
<font color="yellow">I'm not getting a good feeling about him.</font>

615
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,430
<font color="yellow">- Where are you?
- I'm still at work.</font>

616
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,870
<font color="yellow">I'm working late in the office tonight.</font>

617
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,350
<font color="yellow">Call me when you're done.
I will come get you.</font>

618
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,200
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay. See you later.</i></font>

619
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,000
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

620
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, I had to take care of something.</font>

621
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,140
<font color="yellow">I had to find some information.</font>

622
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,620
<font color="yellow">- Do Kyung's studio...
- I know.</font>

623
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,930
<font color="yellow">Do Kyung called.</font>

624
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,330
<font color="yellow">Come sit down.</font>

625
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:47,290
<font color="yellow">I... still haven't made the decision yet.</font>

626
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,520
<font color="yellow">Can we talk about it tomorrow?</font>

627
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,410
<font color="yellow">I will tell you tomorrow.</font>

628
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,160
<font color="yellow">By tomorrow...</font>

629
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,980
<font color="yellow">I will definitely tell you.</font>

630
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,910
<font color="yellow">Regardless of your decision</font>

631
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,680
<font color="yellow">I will tell you my decision first.</font>

632
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,120
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

633
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:23,210
<font color="yellow">It's possible that
couples haven't kissed.</font>

634
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,140
<font color="yellow">But no couple will sleep
with each other only once.</font>

635
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,270
<font color="yellow">Couples who slept with each other
will be more likely to do it again.</font>

636
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,910
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

637
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:42,290
<font color="yellow">in our case, since that night</font>

638
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,960
<font color="yellow">we haven't slept with each other.</font>

639
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,960
<font color="yellow">We only slept with each other once.</font>

640
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:55,540
<font color="yellow">It means that we won't
have a shot at being together.</font>

641
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:04,060
<font color="yellow">We did it somehow the first time.</font>

642
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,850
<font color="yellow">I can't do it again either.
It's not going to work.</font>

643
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,810
<font color="yellow">Please go back to your place.</font>

644
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,850
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

645
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,450
<font color="yellow">I've seen you smoke
only twice in my whole life.</font>

646
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,330
<font color="yellow">Once when you
received the draft notice...</font>

647
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,960
<font color="yellow">And yesterday...</font>

648
00:52:52,870 --> 00:53:01,390
<font color="yellow">This isn't something you should
force yourself to handle as a man.</font>

649
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:05,100
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't force yourself
to handle this. It's okay.</font>

650
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,850
<font color="yellow">I was planning on raising the baby
without telling you.</font>

651
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,500
<font color="yellow">You somehow found out.</font>

652
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,890
<font color="yellow">So there is no need
to feel pressured at all.</font>

653
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,830
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung.</font>

654
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,500
<font color="yellow">You and I have been
like family to each other.</font>

655
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:33,500
<font color="yellow">It's impossible that we become a couple
over what happened one night.</font>

656
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,410
<font color="yellow">As of now</font>

657
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:42,270
<font color="yellow">I release you from the responsibility.</font>

658
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:46,210
<font color="yellow">So don't look back and just go.</font>

659
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,620
<font color="yellow">- I will kill you if you look back.
- Soo Kyung.</font>

660
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,040
<font color="yellow">You've tried your best.
I have tried my best too.</font>

661
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,230
<font color="yellow">It's been enough.</font>

662
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,450
<font color="yellow">It's okay, so go.</font>

663
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,350
<font color="yellow">Don't turn around.</font>

664
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,500
<font color="yellow">Go now.</font>

665
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,750
<font color="yellow">I said I'd kill you if you turn around.</font>

666
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,370
<font color="yellow">Look straight ahead and go.</font>

667
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,180
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

668
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:28,290
<font color="yellow">Go. Go! Hurry. Go!</font>

669
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,540
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

670
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,770
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

671
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

672
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,730
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the way you walk?</font>

673
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,120
<font color="yellow">Walk like a tough guy.</font>

674
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,620
<font color="yellow">Left foot. Left foot.</font>

675
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,560
<font color="yellow">Now! Left foot.</font>

676
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,120
<font color="yellow">Left foot! Left foot! Good job!</font>

677
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,160
<font color="yellow">Left foot. Left foot.
Left foot. March to the rhythm.</font>

678
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,390
<font color="yellow">Left foot! Good job!</font>

679
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,770
<font color="yellow">Change feet and keep walking.</font>

680
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,870
<font color="yellow">Left foot. Left foot. Left foot.</font>

681
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,020
<font color="yellow">March to the rhythm.</font>

682
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,180
<font color="yellow">Left foot. Left foot. Left foot.</font>

683
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,230
<font color="yellow">Left foot.</font>

684
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,370
<font color="yellow">Left foot.</font>

685
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,960
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

686
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:11,290
<font color="yellow">- Come in.
- No, outside.</font>

687
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,290
<font color="yellow">You think I might do something to you?</font>

688
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,310
<font color="yellow">Let's talk out here.</font>

689
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,390
<font color="yellow">I only have water.</font>

690
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,790
<font color="yellow">The night before our wedding...</font>

691
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,910
<font color="yellow">you told me that you couldn't
stand the way I eat.</font>

692
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,020
<font color="yellow">That day...</font>

693
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,080
<font color="yellow">you gave me a death sentence.</font>

694
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:20,210
<font color="yellow">It was the same
as if I had to go kill myself.</font>

695
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,560
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to open
my eyes the next day.</font>

696
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,100
<font color="yellow">I wanted to die.</font>

697
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,330
<font color="yellow">How should I kill myself?</font>

698
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,600
<font color="yellow">I should make it
a pure accidental death.</font>

699
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,520
<font color="yellow">Nobody should know why I died.</font>

700
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:44,350
<font color="yellow">But I thought you'd tell everybody
when you came to my funeral.</font>

701
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,060
<font color="yellow">Then I would be humiliated
again even after death.</font>

702
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,160
<font color="yellow">I tried everything
in order to stay alive.</font>

703
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,980
<font color="yellow">My heart had already
been broken into pieces.</font>

704
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,250
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard it is to
fear someone will find out about you...</font>

705
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,350
<font color="yellow">so you walk around
as if nothing happened?</font>

706
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,290
<font color="yellow">I felt as if my heart all melted...</font>

707
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,930
<font color="yellow">and I was slowly disappearing.</font>

708
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,290
<font color="yellow">I couldn't breathe.</font>

709
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:17,140
<font color="yellow">I had to force myself to breathe.</font>

710
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,660
<font color="yellow">Now you tell me that you did that for me?</font>

711
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:27,770
<font color="yellow">You'd definitely have said
you would wait for me.</font>

712
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, I would have.</font>

713
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,500
<font color="yellow">You'd have gotten tired of waiting.</font>

714
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,160
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you let me
get tired of waiting?</font>

715
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,100
<font color="yellow">You chose to make me want to die instead?</font>

716
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,230
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to put you through
a lot and pressure you.</font>

717
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,140
<font color="yellow">You didn't want to pressure me,
yet you hurt me so badly?</font>

718
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,850
<font color="yellow">You call that love?</font>

719
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,680
<font color="yellow">You chose to hurt me badly
instead of pressuring me.</font>

720
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,230
<font color="yellow">Is that really love?</font>

721
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,730
<font color="yellow">To men, that's love?</font>

722
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,730
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn how to love?</font>

723
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,060
<font color="yellow">A woman hears something
humiliating from a man and...</font>

724
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:04,230
<font color="yellow">gets dumped the day before her wedding.</font>

725
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,710
<font color="yellow">Or she waits for the man
who has gone bankrupt.</font>

726
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,310
<font color="yellow">Which do you think would
be harder on the woman?</font>

727
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:09,500
<font color="yellow">Didn't you ever think about that part?</font>

728
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,830
<font color="yellow">After hearing that you were in prison...</font>

729
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,370
<font color="yellow">I felt so relieved.</font>

730
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:18,430
<font color="yellow">It made me think that I wasn't
such an undesirable woman.</font>

731
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:20,290
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was spared.</font>

732
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,930
<font color="yellow">Don't say you're having
your revenge on him</font>

733
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,180
<font color="yellow">because he took away the woman you loved.</font>

734
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,500
<font color="yellow">You never loved me.</font>

01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,700
<font color="yellow">When I was struggling so badly...</font>

736
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,160
<font color="yellow">he took care of me.</font>

737
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,140
<font color="yellow">I was able to go on because of him.</font>

738
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,330
<font color="yellow">I'm still alive today because of him.</font>

739
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,000
<font color="yellow">Come to your senses.</font>

740
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,790
<font color="yellow">Think clearly before and after.</font>

741
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,830
<font color="yellow">He took care of you
because of what he did.</font>

742
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,200
<font color="yellow">- He didn't do that because he liked you.
- But still...</font>

743
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,960
<font color="yellow">But still I was able
to go on because of him.</font>

744
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,180
<font color="yellow">I fell for him first.</font>

745
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,390
<font color="yellow">I begged him to like me back.</font>

746
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,080
<font color="yellow">I was the one who told him
that it was okay...</font>

747
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,410
<font color="yellow">after learning that
he ruined your business.</font>

748
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,160
<font color="yellow">You are crazy.</font>

749
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,270
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

750
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,080
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

751
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,270
<font color="yellow">Why don't you leave now?</font>

752
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,980
<font color="yellow">You can make him go bankrupt.</font>

753
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,410
<font color="yellow">You can make him penniless.</font>

754
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,100
<font color="yellow">It's okay to do all that.</font>

755
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,930
<font color="yellow">Just don't hit him.</font>

756
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,500
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

757
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,520
<font color="yellow">Please don't hit him.</font>

758
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,930
<font color="yellow">It breaks my heart.</font>

759
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,930
<font color="yellow">You're making me such a loser.</font>

760
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

761
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,830
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

762
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:23,540
<font color="yellow">You... shouldn't have come here today.</font>

763
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:38,980
<font color="yellow">I almost got used to your nagging.</font>

764
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:42,620
<font color="yellow">Now you want to say goodbye?</font>

765
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,370
<font color="yellow">He's telling me to get lost.</font>

766
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,700
<font color="yellow">I can't go.</font>

767
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,500
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to us.</font>

768
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,410
<font color="yellow">I'm very hurt, seriously.</font>

769
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,060
<font color="yellow">You all are saying goodbye
to Park Do Kyung now?</font>

770
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so whiny?</font>

771
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,600
<font color="yellow">I will go first.</font>

772
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,390
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Where?</font>

773
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,270
<font color="yellow"><i>When will you be done?
Will it take long?</i></font>

774
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,770
<font color="yellow"><i>Wrap it up and come out.
I'm in front of your building. </i></font>

775
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:13,870
<font color="yellow">Mister, can you drop me off
at the rear door?</font>

776
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:56,200
<font color="yellow">Mister, can you open the door, please?</font>

777
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,230
<font color="yellow">No, I should come in this way.
Please open the door.</font>

778
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:06,410
<font color="yellow">Mister, please open this door.</font>

779
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,960
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

780
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,330
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me earlier?</font>

781
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,450
<font color="yellow">I'd have come out sooner.</font>

782
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,750
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

783
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,310
<font color="yellow">You just don't get it, do you?</font>

784
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:15,680
<font color="yellow">You brought two umbrellas.</font>

785
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,710
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I worked all night,
so I'm very tired.</font>

786
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,200
<font color="yellow">But I still want to beat you up.</font>

787
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,710
<font color="yellow">I like us having our own umbrellas.</font>

788
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not getting any raindrops on me.
My shoulder isn't getting wet.</font>

789
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,930
<font color="yellow">What if that old man wasn't there?</font>

790
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,960
<font color="yellow">We'd have walked all the way
holding our own umbrellas?</font>

791
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,160
<font color="yellow">If so, you'd have been beaten up
with the umbrella tonight.</font>

792
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,140
<font color="yellow">- That's enough.
- Why did you bring two?</font>

793
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:04,730
<font color="yellow">Well, I knew it
when you called for the driver</font>

794
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,160
<font color="yellow">in the middle of the night at the beach.</font>

795
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,310
<font color="yellow">- Can I say something, please?
- Okay, go ahead.</font>

796
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,500
<font color="yellow">Speak.</font>

797
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,980
<font color="yellow">You don't have anything to say.</font>

798
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,250
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

799
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,210
<font color="yellow">I'm on top of the world.</font>
