00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,841
<font color="yellow">You just don't get it, do you?
You brought two umbrellas.</font>

4
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:33,322
<font color="yellow">I'm very tired from working all night.
But I still want to beat you up.</font>

5
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,268
<font color="yellow">I like us having our own umbrellas.</font>

6
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:39,289
<font color="yellow">I'm not getting any raindrops on me.
My shoulder isn't getting wet.</font>

7
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:04,400
<font color="yellow">What if that old man wasn't there?</font>

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,713
<font color="yellow">Would we have walked all the way
holding our own umbrellas?</font>

9
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,626
<font color="yellow">If so, you'd have been beaten up
with the umbrella tonight.</font>

10
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,712
<font color="yellow">- That's enough.
- Why did you bring two?</font>

11
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,701
<font color="yellow">I knew it when you called a driver
in the middle of the night at the beach.</font>

12
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,620
<font color="yellow">- Can I say something, please?
- Okay, go ahead.</font>

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,659
<font color="yellow">Speak.</font>

14
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:31,771
<font color="yellow">You don't even have anything to say.</font>

15
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:38,293
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

16
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,418
<font color="yellow">I'm on top of the world!</font>

17
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,108
<font color="yellow">You're finally telling me that now?
Took you long enough.</font>

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,926
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to say anything?</font>

19
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:25,118
<font color="yellow">People usually respond in a certain way.</font>

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,712
<font color="yellow">I wonder if I could
give you an answer here.</font>

21
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,336
<font color="yellow">- I also love Park Do Kyung--
- That's enough.</font>

22
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:37,032
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? I want to reply to you.</font>

23
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,520
<font color="yellow">- I also love Park Do Kyung--
- That's enough. It's fine.</font>

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,223
<font color="yellow">- Why not?
- Forget it.</font>

25
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,765
<font color="yellow">I'm so pitiful.</font>

26
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:07,323
<font color="yellow">I'm over the moon like an idiot from
hearing that one phrase "I love you."</font>

27
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,620
<font color="yellow">It's because you haven't
been giving me anything.</font>

28
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:15,183
<font color="yellow">I haven't given you a reply yet.
Could I do it here?</font>

29
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,949
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Don't.</font>

30
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,753
<font color="yellow">I love Park Do Kyung a lot too!</font>

31
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:32,812
<font color="yellow">Park Do Kyung is mine!</font>

00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:19,653
<font color="yellow">Lift it.</font>

34
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,930
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go in.</font>

35
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:55,939
<font color="yellow">Should we just go over to your place?</font>

36
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,810
<font color="yellow">She's 32 years old.</font>

37
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,216
<font color="yellow">Isn't a 32-year-old woman still a woman?</font>

38
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,939
<font color="yellow">The world's biggest idiot.</font>

39
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,348
<font color="yellow">You know, you did the same
thing when we used to date...</font>

40
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,649
<font color="yellow">That's why she's the biggest idiot.</font>

41
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,913
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

42
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,425
<font color="yellow">I've gotten prettier.</font>

43
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,041
<font color="yellow">I've gotten prettier from being in love.</font>

44
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:35,487
<font color="yellow">Sir, hold up! Wait! Wait, please!</font>

45
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,581
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be late for work!</font>

46
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,615
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I can just get yelled at.</font>

47
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,458
<font color="yellow">Who cares if I'm late?
Love is what matters the most.</font>

48
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,119
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

49
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,367
<font color="yellow">Wake up!</font>

50
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:18,923
<font color="yellow">That scared me.</font>

51
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:22,920
<font color="yellow">I got scared because I thought
I got drunk and went over to your place.</font>

52
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,338
<font color="yellow">My god.</font>

53
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:29,704
<font color="yellow">- You didn't go home?
- You know how it is at my place.</font>

54
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:32,969
<font color="yellow">Women are constantly ringing my bell.</font>

55
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,985
<font color="yellow">- Ouch. My head hurts.
- Get up. Let's go to a sauna.</font>

56
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,360
<font color="yellow">I was being especially careful today.</font>

57
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,809
<font color="yellow">I took my shirt off first
and put my pants on first.</font>

58
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,163
<font color="yellow">I was trying to be considerate for you.</font>

59
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,854
<font color="yellow">But it seemed like you didn't notice it.</font>

60
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,158
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

61
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:02,128
<font color="yellow">Please compliment me.</font>

62
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,078
<font color="yellow">I need compliments.</font>

63
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,200
<font color="yellow">I feel tired</font>

64
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,845
<font color="yellow">and I can't even have fun
from playing all night long.</font>

65
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:22,847
<font color="yellow">It feels like I'm walking around with
the word "bastard" on my forehead.</font>

66
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:26,302
<font color="yellow">It also feels like that word is
stamped on my heart.</font>

67
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,542
<font color="yellow">- Why did you even leave our house then?
- I got kicked out.</font>

68
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't walk out on my two feet.</font>

69
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,543
<font color="yellow">She even gave me a command,
ordering me to go without looking back.</font>

70
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:36,152
<font color="yellow">"Left. Left. Left..."</font>

71
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:40,326
<font color="yellow">I was going to marry Soo Kyung.</font>

72
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,870
<font color="yellow">You know I'm not that much of a bastard.</font>

73
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:52,758
<font color="yellow">But this is what Soo Kyung told me.</font>

74
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,620
<font color="yellow">"You shouldn't force yourself
to handle this."</font>

75
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,046
<font color="yellow">I got caught while I was smoking.</font>

76
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:04,615
<font color="yellow">Since I smoked after failing the bar
and getting drafted...</font>

77
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:10,456
<font color="yellow">That was the second time
I had smoked again.</font>

78
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:16,456
<font color="yellow">She completely saw through me.</font>

79
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:21,191
<font color="yellow">So freaking embarrassing.</font>

80
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:22,922
<font color="yellow">I feel extremely sorry.</font>

81
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,794
<font color="yellow">So embarrassing.</font>

82
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:33,136
<font color="yellow">Do Kyung. Please give me a hug.</font>

83
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:49,296
<font color="yellow">So embarrassing... I'm so sorry.</font>

84
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:56,729
<font color="yellow">How's Soo Kyung doing?</font>

85
00:10:58,464 --> 00:11:00,384
<font color="yellow">Don't be lonely.</font>

86
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:05,307
<font color="yellow">Although you may not have a father</font>

87
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:09,799
<font color="yellow">you have a father-like mother
and a father-like uncle.</font>

88
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,884
<font color="yellow">If you still feel like you need a father</font>

89
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:16,568
<font color="yellow">I'll rummage through all the men
in this world if I have to</font>

90
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,837
<font color="yellow">and find you the best father ever!</font>

91
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,100
<font color="yellow">This is the analysis of the first
half of the next year's trends.</font>

92
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,385
<font color="yellow">If I can't read it from
the very first sentence</font>

93
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:56,211
<font color="yellow">it's not a proper analysis.</font>

94
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,226
<font color="yellow">- Again.
- Again.</font>

95
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,442
<font color="yellow">- Bring me a cup of coffee.
- Sure.</font>

96
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,763
<font color="yellow">- Insert the sound we recently recorded.
- Sure.</font>

97
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:26,886
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.
You know how we are.</font>

98
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,149
<font color="yellow">Even if the sky falls,
we'll get the job done.</font>

99
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,543
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a call once
we move to a new studio.</font>

100
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,381
<font color="yellow">Sure. Okay. Bye.</font>

101
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,256
<font color="yellow">Joon Hee and Ki Tae are
looking for a studio.</font>

102
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:45,152
<font color="yellow">Some cheap place in a basement
or something. I'm letting you know.</font>

103
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:47,250
<font color="yellow">We're not going to another company.</font>

104
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,581
<font color="yellow">Because people are always asking for you</font>

105
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,393
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we'll reestablish
our company soon.</font>

106
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,890
<font color="yellow">You're so awesome.
How can you get any work done?</font>

107
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,960
<font color="yellow">- Go apologize to CEO Jang.
- That won't resolve this problem.</font>

108
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,340
<font color="yellow">And let that girl go back to
where she belongs.</font>

109
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,750
<font color="yellow">- That will put an end to all of this.
- Forget it.</font>

110
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,900
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to punish me right now?</font>

111
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,390
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to show me that
you've gone bankrupt because of me?</font>

112
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,350
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make me feel guilty
for all the things I've done wrong?</font>

113
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,880
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

114
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,170
<font color="yellow">This all happened because of me.</font>

115
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,100
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

116
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,840
<font color="yellow">What do you need?</font>

117
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,830
<font color="yellow">Does Do Kyung...</font>

118
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,090
<font color="yellow">have some health issues?</font>

119
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,660
<font color="yellow"><i>He's being weird.</i></font>

120
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,590
<font color="yellow">I think something is up with him.</font>

121
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,400
<font color="yellow">He won't get angry at me!</font>

122
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,470
<font color="yellow">Something is definitely up with him.
Hurry and look into it.</font>

123
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,690
<font color="yellow">You won't even wilt.
I'm so proud of you.</font>

124
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,070
<font color="yellow">You're hanging in there to
not hurt my feelings, aren't you?</font>

125
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,980
<font color="yellow">Don't get lonely and cry at night.</font>

126
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,460
<font color="yellow">I'll come early tomorrow morning.</font>

127
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,340
<font color="yellow">What are the flowers saying?
You shouldn't talk to flowers.</font>

128
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,300
<font color="yellow">That's weirder than
sticking flowers in your hair.</font>

129
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,850
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Sang Joo says she'll buy dinner.</font>

130
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,850
<font color="yellow">Really?
I want unlimited pork cutlet then.</font>

131
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,340
<font color="yellow">I just finished work. What's up?</font>

132
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,040
<font color="yellow">- Let's have dinner with Soo Kyung.
- With Director Park?</font>

133
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,450
<font color="yellow">Tell him to forget it.</font>

134
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,980
<font color="yellow">We told you we'd go pick you up.</font>

135
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,670
<font color="yellow">Why would you drive back and forth?
We just took a cab instead.</font>

136
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,390
<font color="yellow">You're not even alone...</font>

137
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,000
<font color="yellow">There are two of you.
Of course we should go pick you up.</font>

138
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,990
<font color="yellow">- Let's head in.
- Sure.</font>

139
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,940
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

140
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,740
<font color="yellow">I heard that woman's boyfriend
ruined our studio.</font>

141
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,340
<font color="yellow">- I'm that woman's boyfriend.
- You've lost it, haven't you?</font>

142
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,000
<font color="yellow">Don't say a word about it.
I'll kill you if you do.</font>

143
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,340
<font color="yellow">You two look like a married couple.
How nice.</font>

144
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,540
<font color="yellow">Our studio is...</font>

145
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,890
<font color="yellow">Love is so great.</font>

146
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,090
<font color="yellow">You two should head upstairs
and eat by yourselves. Why eat with us?</font>

147
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,350
<font color="yellow">They can at least eat with us. They can't
do other stuff when eating anyway.</font>

148
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,020
<font color="yellow">You always give me that look
whenever I say something.</font>

149
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,670
<font color="yellow">Where's the fun if you can't
tease a lovey-dovey couple?</font>

150
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,790
<font color="yellow">I won't get jealous. I have pride.</font>

151
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,900
<font color="yellow">- Come and have a seat.
- Okay.</font>

152
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,650
<font color="yellow">Take a seat. Let's eat.</font>

153
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,780
<font color="yellow">Have lots.
Do Kyung told me you like melons.</font>

154
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,660
<font color="yellow">I like meat and raw fish too.
There are a lot of things that I like.</font>

155
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,550
<font color="yellow">Never reply to him if he ever
asks you if you like something.</font>

156
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,280
<font color="yellow">He'll just buy that food for 365 days.</font>

157
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,070
<font color="yellow">30 years ago,
when I was 14 years old</font>

158
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,300
<font color="yellow">I told him I love melons after
having one for the first time.</font>

159
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,640
<font color="yellow">Since then, he's been only
buying melons for me. Melons!</font>

160
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
<font color="yellow">Let me just say a word.</font>

161
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,390
<font color="yellow">Please give a lot of love
to our Do Kyung.</font>

162
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,260
<font color="yellow">He's a pitiful guy.</font>

163
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,140
<font color="yellow">Could I take and raise him?</font>

164
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,940
<font color="yellow">- I'm just kidding.
- I took you seriously.</font>

165
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,780
<font color="yellow">Take him and raise him.</font>

166
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,180
<font color="yellow">Suffocate him with
your overwhelming love--</font>

167
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,080
<font color="yellow">I will unless I die first from
my heart fluttering too much.</font>

168
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,670
<font color="yellow">Wow. You won't even budge a little.
You must like him a lot.</font>

169
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,480
<font color="yellow">Enough that I could
bungee jump without a harness.</font>

170
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,540
<font color="yellow">Not by myself. The two of us together.</font>

171
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,140
<font color="yellow">I think you're... a little crazy.</font>

172
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,740
<font color="yellow">Don't take things too far.</font>

173
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,100
<font color="yellow">Even though he's my brother</font>

174
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,160
<font color="yellow">I can only cheer on
someone else's love so much.</font>

175
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,370
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

176
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,290
<font color="yellow">By the way, that lawyer friend
must be late today.</font>

177
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,080
<font color="yellow">If we look for him, we can find him.
He's probably in hiding.</font>

178
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,570
<font color="yellow">Lee Jin Sang! Come out and eat!</font>

179
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,090
<font color="yellow">- Lee Jin Sang!
- He's not here.</font>

180
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,700
<font color="yellow">He won't come here anymore.</font>

181
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,680
<font color="yellow">This dude...</font>

182
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,670
<font color="yellow">ran away, didn't he?</font>

183
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,230
<font color="yellow">He just went somewhere.</font>

184
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,880
<font color="yellow">It seems like he has done
something really bad.</font>

185
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,350
<font color="yellow">- What has he done?
- He did something.</font>

186
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,220
<font color="yellow">- What did he do?
- I'll tell you about it later.</font>

187
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,950
<font color="yellow">I'm so curious.
Why can't you just tell me?</font>

188
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,720
<font color="yellow">I feel kind of hurt.
Everyone but me knows about it.</font>

189
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,030
<font color="yellow">What would you like to listen to?</font>

190
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,400
<font color="yellow">Instead of listening to something</font>

191
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,060
<font color="yellow">let's sing and record that song</font>

192
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,290
<font color="yellow">you sang when you were young.
"The Daydream."</font>

193
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,250
<font color="yellow">I think it'll feel weird when you
listen to it later. When we're old.</font>

194
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,470
<font color="yellow">Your voice as a six-year-old.
Your voice as a 36-year-old.</font>

195
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,440
<font color="yellow">- I think it would be cool.
- Forget it.</font>

196
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,140
<font color="yellow">Why not? Let's record it.
Sing it for me.</font>

197
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,780
<font color="yellow">The voice of the man I love the most</font>

198
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,890
<font color="yellow">recorded at the moment
I loved him the most.</font>

199
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,680
<font color="yellow">I want to have it recorded.</font>

200
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,880
<font color="yellow">I want to hear it. Sing it for me.</font>

201
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,110
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

202
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,610
<font color="yellow">What's this? Is it a handcuff?</font>

203
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,780
<font color="yellow">Do you like this kind of stuff?</font>

204
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,420
<font color="yellow">I'm flustered.</font>

205
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,260
<font color="yellow">This isn't an old thing of mine.
I bought it.</font>

206
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,340
<font color="yellow">Am I going to die?</font>

207
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,690
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so good to me?</font>

208
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,270
<font color="yellow">I'm scared because
you're being so good to me.</font>

209
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,990
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by.
It looked pretty, so I bought it.</font>

210
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,360
<font color="yellow">I feel anxious.</font>

211
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,260
<font color="yellow">I'm beyond happy,
but I'm also beyond anxious.</font>

212
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,360
<font color="yellow">- Am I anxious from being too happy?
- Don't think too much into it.</font>

213
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,190
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be this happy right now,
but I am.</font>

214
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,960
<font color="yellow">Then just be happy.</font>

215
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,460
<font color="yellow">Then I'll just be happy.</font>

216
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,970
<font color="yellow">And I'll brush my teeth.</font>

217
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,370
<font color="yellow">Could I also take a shower?</font>

218
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,860
<font color="yellow">I'll take you home.</font>

219
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,730
<font color="yellow">Okay! Everybody, look! Come on!</font>

220
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, everybody. Come on!</font>

221
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,530
<font color="yellow">Jump! Jump! Jump!</font>

222
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,870
<font color="yellow">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

223
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,950
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to have fun all at once?</font>

224
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,840
<font color="yellow">- You're going overboard today.
- Yeah.</font>

225
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,300
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you been here?</font>

226
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,120
<font color="yellow">I was a little... busy.</font>

227
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,850
<font color="yellow">But from now on, I'm going to
have fun without feeling guilty.</font>

228
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,220
<font color="yellow">Every day. Every night. Party, party.
Crazy party! Drink it! Cheers!</font>

229
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,910
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law!</font>

230
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,820
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't live this way.
Think about the kid.</font>

231
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,150
<font color="yellow">What has Soo Kyung done wrong?</font>

232
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,120
<font color="yellow">That kid... Has he lost it?</font>

233
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,800
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Nothing.
He's a younger brother of my friend.</font>

234
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
<font color="yellow">He just wants to mess with me.</font>

235
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,530
<font color="yellow">He's taking things
a little too far though.</font>

236
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,110
<font color="yellow">Have a drink. Here we go.</font>

237
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,150
<font color="yellow">Let's go home, brother-in-law!</font>

238
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,020
<font color="yellow">Even if Soo Kyung has freed you,
you shouldn't do this to her.</font>

239
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,840
<font color="yellow">That bastard!</font>

240
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,540
<font color="yellow">You bastard!</font>

241
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,170
<font color="yellow">Park Hoon, stop right there!</font>

242
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,850
<font color="yellow">Hey!
I'll kill you once I get a hold of you!</font>

243
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,670
<font color="yellow">A married life without love
isn't necessarily bad!</font>

244
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,950
<font color="yellow">You're crazy, aren't you?</font>

245
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,190
<font color="yellow">Get out of my sight! Get lost! Leave!</font>

246
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,340
<font color="yellow">Soo Kyung still loves you.</font>

247
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,980
<font color="yellow">- Why can't you understand women?
- I can't! I don't know!</font>

248
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,130
<font color="yellow">- You, come over here.
- Hey. Why can't you say it?</font>

249
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,420
<font color="yellow">- Why can't you say that it's your baby?
- You...</font>

250
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,910
<font color="yellow">Why can't you say that you have a baby?</font>

251
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,570
<font color="yellow">You're a daddy!</font>

252
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,750
<font color="yellow">What's freaking wrong with our family?</font>

253
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,560
<font color="yellow">My brother has filed for bankruptcy</font>

254
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,100
<font color="yellow">and my brother-in-law has left home!
What is this?</font>

255
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,320
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

256
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,770
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

257
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,670
<font color="yellow">That crazy kid. Crazy bastard.</font>

258
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,800
<font color="yellow">He's just this guy I know.</font>

259
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,480
<font color="yellow">But he follows me around
and causes a scene like that.</font>

260
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,300
<font color="yellow">This must be fun for him.</font>

261
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,380
<font color="yellow">Let's go dance.</font>

262
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,720
<font color="yellow">You should go in.</font>

263
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,720
<font color="yellow">Drive safely, okay?</font>

264
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,360
<font color="yellow">That hurts, Hae Young.</font>

265
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,810
<font color="yellow"><i>If I look back on this moment as I die...</i></font>

266
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,200
<font color="yellow"><i>I won't regret it.</i></font>

267
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,490
<font color="yellow"><i>I won't regret it.</i></font>

268
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,730
<font color="yellow">Whoever comes to my house
always asks for a favor.</font>

269
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,120
<font color="yellow">Everyone just wants something.</font>

270
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,760
<font color="yellow">I used to like you because
you never asked me for anything.</font>

271
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,390
<font color="yellow">You're ultimately letting me down.</font>

272
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,960
<font color="yellow">This all started because of me.</font>

273
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,350
<font color="yellow">If Do Kyung's life crumbles,
I can't let go of him. I beg you.</font>

274
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,380
<font color="yellow">I want to forget about him. Even if
that means this is what I must do.</font>

275
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,940
<font color="yellow">Please help me out.</font>

276
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,630
<font color="yellow">Take this vegetable away!</font>

277
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,800
<font color="yellow">You're trying to starve
an old man to death!</font>

278
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,290
<font color="yellow">You can leave.</font>

279
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,990
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's a little childish?</font>

280
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,970
<font color="yellow">Forming a team against them?</font>

281
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,820
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

282
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,010
<font color="yellow">Didn't you want those two
to break up more than anyone else?</font>

283
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,330
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Perhaps.</font>

284
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,870
<font color="yellow">But I haven't looked that
deeply into my heart.</font>

285
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,940
<font color="yellow">Because I don't want to look into it.</font>

286
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,800
<font color="yellow">Because I might actually feel that way.</font>

287
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,120
<font color="yellow">So I'm doing something before
that resentment comes out.</font>

288
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,910
<font color="yellow">"I really want them to be happy."</font>

289
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,220
<font color="yellow">"I genuinely want them to be happy."
I keep saying this to myself.</font>

290
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,680
<font color="yellow">You make life difficult on yourself.</font>

291
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,020
<font color="yellow">I understand. That's how I used to
feel until about a few days ago too.</font>

292
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,150
<font color="yellow">I used to feel so bad about
doing all this mean stuff to him.</font>

293
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,930
<font color="yellow">So I tried to figure out
why I felt so bad.</font>

294
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,650
<font color="yellow">It was because I was trying
to be half mean, half nice.</font>

295
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,950
<font color="yellow">I was telling myself,
"I'm not completely a mean person."</font>

296
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,650
<font color="yellow">"I'll just be half mean, half nice."</font>

297
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,050
<font color="yellow">"So give in and bow out
right about now."</font>

298
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,100
<font color="yellow">But the type of people
I hate the most in this world is...</font>

299
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,860
<font color="yellow">those who are half nice, half mean...</font>

300
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,690
<font color="yellow">and half rude.</font>

301
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,270
<font color="yellow">Don't try to grudgingly do something
you don't want to do.</font>

302
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,380
<font color="yellow">Just follow your heart.</font>

303
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,180
<font color="yellow">And wish that those two break up.
That would seem cooler.</font>

304
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,120
<font color="yellow">From talking to you, I can see why.</font>

305
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,070
<font color="yellow">People say you truly get to know
someone once you break up with them.</font>

306
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,100
<font color="yellow">After breaking up with Do Kyung</font>

307
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,540
<font color="yellow">I saw how great of a person he is.
So I felt sad about our breakup.</font>

308
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,380
<font color="yellow">But it seems like Hae Young won't
be sad over her breakup like me.</font>

309
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,680
<font color="yellow">You come up very short
against Park Do Kyung.</font>

310
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,690
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

311
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,550
<font color="yellow">Director Park.</font>

312
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,450
<font color="yellow">I hear the research and development team
has made a prototype. Let's go see it.</font>

313
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,970
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's.</font>

314
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,230
<font color="yellow">I think that product doesn't fit in
with the season very well.</font>

315
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,630
<font color="yellow">Hey. Madam Park Soo Kyung.</font>

316
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,030
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- That woman is just ignoring me.</font>

317
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,120
<font color="yellow">In order to make it suit the season...</font>

318
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,390
<font color="yellow">- Why won't you answer my calls?
- Leave. I'm at work.</font>

319
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,520
<font color="yellow">Wearing high heels? Are you crazy?</font>

320
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,570
<font color="yellow">You're a 44-year-old pregnant woman.
How could you wear high heels?</font>

321
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,730
<font color="yellow">So? You haven't done anything to turn
me into a 44-year-old pregnant woman!</font>

322
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,590
<font color="yellow">- But I did.
- Crazy bastard.</font>

323
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,580
<font color="yellow">Since last night, I probably called you
over a thousand times.</font>

324
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,060
<font color="yellow">So stubborn. How could you so
adamantly ignore my calls?</font>

325
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,930
<font color="yellow">- Are you trying to fight me?
- I have no reason to take your calls.</font>

326
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,680
<font color="yellow">When you kicked me out of your house</font>

327
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,230
<font color="yellow">didn't that mean we could still
be like brother and sister?</font>

328
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,120
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.
How would that be possible?</font>

329
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,480
<font color="yellow">Wow. I didn't know you were this uncool!</font>

330
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,900
<font color="yellow">Cool my ass. Screw that!</font>

331
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,050
<font color="yellow">Who in their right mind could
sleep with a man, get pregnant</font>

332
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,490
<font color="yellow">do all this stuff, and still maintain
a brother-sister like relationship?</font>

333
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,450
<font color="yellow">You said you majored in French, right?</font>

334
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,510
<font color="yellow">What are they blabbering about?</font>

335
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,910
<font color="yellow">I can't understand
a single thing they're saying.</font>

336
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

337
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,430
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

338
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,830
<font color="yellow">Fine then.</font>

339
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,040
<font color="yellow">You don't even want to stay friends now.</font>

340
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,160
<font color="yellow">Let's not ever see each other then.
I'm fine with that.</font>

341
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,480
<font color="yellow">It won't be hard for me.</font>

342
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,950
<font color="yellow">Hurray. Let's not ever see each other.</font>

343
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare change your mind later.</font>

344
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,370
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

345
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,580
<font color="yellow">- Is something wrong?
- What is it?</font>

346
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,200
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

347
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,310
<font color="yellow">Let's give it another try.</font>

348
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,730
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about the kiss.</font>

349
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,680
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

350
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,140
<font color="yellow">I know this word.</font>

351
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,580
<font color="yellow">- Let's get off the elevator.
- We have to get to a meeting.</font>

352
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,640
<font color="yellow">- Just get off.
- Why do we have to get off?</font>

353
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,830
<font color="yellow">What was it? What did he say?</font>

354
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,640
<font color="yellow">He asked her to kiss him.</font>

355
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,560
<font color="yellow">Kiss?</font>

356
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,480
<font color="yellow">He looked normal...</font>

357
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,080
<font color="yellow">Plus, he looked way younger.</font>

358
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,120
<font color="yellow">- Director Park is kissing...
- Wow.</font>

359
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,410
<font color="yellow">- Director Park is kissing him...
- It's very cool.</font>

360
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,250
<font color="yellow">They are good kissers.</font>

361
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,350
<font color="yellow">- They're really kissing.
- You're cool, Director Park.</font>

362
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,830
<font color="yellow">Wow, how charming. Wow.</font>

363
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,520
<font color="yellow">Wow, Director Park knows how to kiss.</font>

364
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,930
<font color="yellow">- Thanks.
- I've wanted to pay a visit anyway.</font>

365
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,020
<font color="yellow">Thanks for asking me to do that.</font>

366
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,750
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Everything will be okay.</font>

367
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,200
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

368
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

369
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,000
<font color="yellow">He keeps seeing things.
It seems something is about to happen.</font>

370
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,890
<font color="yellow">Can we hypnotize him? Please.</font>

371
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,120
<font color="yellow">We can't just sit back and do nothing.</font>

372
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you okay?</i></font>

373
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,140
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't touch him.</i></font>

00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,890
<font color="yellow"><i>White flowers are coming
down from the night sky.</i></font>

375
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,960
<font color="yellow"><i>What kind of flowers are they?</i></font>

376
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,330
<font color="yellow"><i>They look like cherry blossoms.</i></font>

377
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,330
<font color="yellow"><i>But I'm not so sure.</i></font>

381
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,850
<font color="yellow">Was it exactly 2016?</font>

382
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,850
<font color="yellow">Was it exactly June in 2016?</font>

383
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,580
<font color="yellow">But cherry blossoms
don't make sense then.</font>

384
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,060
<font color="yellow">First, leave for overseas. Just run.</font>

385
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,410
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't come all the way
overseas to kill you.</font>

386
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,100
<font color="yellow">Let's leave straight for the airport now.</font>

387
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,600
<font color="yellow">Go home and get your passport.</font>

388
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,500
<font color="yellow">I will drive you
to the airport. Let's go.</font>

389
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, Do Kyung.</font>

390
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600

00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,770

396
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,120
<font color="yellow">In all these years</font>

397
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,680
<font color="yellow">this is my second time that a man
called me out in the night....</font>

398
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,500
<font color="yellow">since this senior guy
in college called me.</font>

399
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,120
<font color="yellow">He wasn't my style.</font>

400
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,680
<font color="yellow">But he seemed to like me a lot.</font>

401
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,000
<font color="yellow">He met me
for the first time at our orientation.</font>

402
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,660
<font color="yellow">He even remembered the seventh time
we ran into each other.</font>

403
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,020
<font color="yellow">We ran into each other at the library.</font>

404
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,120
<font color="yellow">It was the front gate the third time
and the fourth time was...</font>

405
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,200
<font color="yellow">Do you remember where we first met?</font>

406
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,810
<font color="yellow">How can I not know?</font>

407
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,710
<font color="yellow">I first met you at the cafe with Hee Ran.</font>

408
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,640
<font color="yellow">You made my nose bleed.</font>

409
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,890
<font color="yellow">- It wasn't there.
- What do you mean? It was there.</font>

410
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,640
<font color="yellow">We met before that... on the street.</font>

411
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,680
<font color="yellow"><i>You turned around.
Don't you remember?</i></font>

412
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,330
<font color="yellow">Which street was it?</font>

413
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,620
<font color="yellow">It was in front of
the post office in Ye Yi Do.</font>

414
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,000
<font color="yellow">That's right. I went there.</font>

415
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,060
<font color="yellow">What was that then? You saw me
for the first time on the street...</font>

416
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,160
<font color="yellow">and fell in love at first sight
and remembered me all along?</font>

417
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

418
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,560
<font color="yellow">I knew you even before that.</font>

419
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,290
<font color="yellow">- How?
- Your face kept popping up in my head</font>

420
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,290
<font color="yellow">when we'd never met before.</font>

421
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,810
<font color="yellow">And I saw you in person on the street.</font>

422
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,040
<font color="yellow">And then I met you at the cafe.</font>

423
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,200
<font color="yellow">How did I pop in your head
when we'd never met?</font>

424
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,120
<font color="yellow">It was just...</font>

425
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,480
<font color="yellow">It was like a memory...</font>

426
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,230
<font color="yellow">I kept seeing you.</font>

427
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,680
<font color="yellow">I saw you move into that room
even before you actually moved in.</font>

428
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,600
<font color="yellow">I didn't see other stuff.</font>

429
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,210
<font color="yellow">I saw only you.</font>

430
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,330
<font color="yellow">At first, I thought
I was seeing the future.</font>

431
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:47,700
<font color="yellow">I thought I had gained
some kine of superpower.</font>

432
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,230
<font color="yellow">But I realized at some point...</font>

433
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,980
<font color="yellow">what it was that I was seeing...</font>

434
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,310
<font color="yellow">why I was seeing you.</font>

435
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,770
<font color="yellow">Why did you see me?</font>

436
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,210
<font color="yellow">In the future...</font>

437
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,390
<font color="yellow">When I'm dying...</font>

438
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,250
<font color="yellow">it is what I'll think about
at my last breath.</font>

439
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,810
<font color="yellow">It was like a flash.</font>

440
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,210
<font color="yellow">That's what I was seeing.</font>

441
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,980
<font color="yellow">- In the future?
- Yes.</font>

442
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,850
<font color="yellow">Right before I die.</font>

443
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,540
<font color="yellow">Before I die...</font>

444
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,980
<font color="yellow">you are all I was thinking about.</font>

445
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,060
<font color="yellow"><i>I missed you so much that...</i></font>

446
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:53,060
<font color="yellow"><i>those feelings crossed over time.</i></font>

447
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,430
<font color="yellow">My doctor said it could happen.</font>

448
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,890
<font color="yellow">My memory at the time of dying shows</font>

449
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,140
<font color="yellow">we never got back together,
but went our separate ways.</font>

450
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,230
<font color="yellow">You moved out of here and...</font>

451
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,230
<font color="yellow">it was the end of us.</font>

452
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,140
<font color="yellow">When I was dying</font>

453
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,430
<font color="yellow">I was regretting that most.</font>

454
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,020
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I wasn't
letting myself feel things.</font>

455
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,790
<font color="yellow">Why was I always nervous
about such petty stuff?</font>

456
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
<font color="yellow">To you...</font>

457
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,680
<font color="yellow">I said things that were the opposite
from what I really felt.</font>

458
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,500
<font color="yellow">I will give you whatever you ask.</font>

459
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,850
<font color="yellow">What's the point of stopping one from
leaving when she doesn't want to stay?</font>

460
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,410
<font color="yellow">Sorry I said hi.</font>

461
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,270
<font color="yellow">Don't get sick.</font>

462
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,650
<font color="yellow"><i>What is it that I really want to say?</i></font>

463
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,400
<font color="yellow">Forget the pride and all.</font>

464
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,630
<font color="yellow">What is it that my heart wants most?</font>

465
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,670
<font color="yellow">What is it that I truly want to say?</font>

466
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,170
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

467
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,830
<font color="yellow">just move back in?</font>

468
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,290
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to move back in.</font>

469
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,210
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but this is how I truly feel.</font>

470
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,920
<font color="yellow">I got sick because I couldn't hug you.</font>

471
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,850
<font color="yellow">That's how we got back together.</font>

472
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,670
<font color="yellow">I've never really let myself
feel things, not even once.</font>

473
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,480
<font color="yellow">I was taken aback
when you were forward.</font>

474
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,630
<font color="yellow">Is it okay for a woman to be this way?</font>

475
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,440
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

476
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,460
<font color="yellow">I liked it.</font>

477
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,170
<font color="yellow">I was touched.</font>

478
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,060
<font color="yellow">If I died without experiencing such love</font>

479
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,610
<font color="yellow">I'd feel very sad.</font>

480
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,210
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

481
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,770
<font color="yellow">when I die</font>

482
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,360
<font color="yellow">I won't regret anything.</font>

483
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,650
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

484
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,290
<font color="yellow">If this is all true</font>

485
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,100
<font color="yellow">it's such a cool story.</font>

486
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,960
<font color="yellow">I guess you didn't get married then?</font>

487
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,920
<font color="yellow">Considering that I was the last person
you were thinking about.</font>

488
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,560
<font color="yellow">Probably not.</font>

489
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,020
<font color="yellow">You didn't get married
because you couldn't get over me?</font>

490
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,110
<font color="yellow">Should I believe that story?</font>

491
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,500
<font color="yellow">You called me out in the middle of
the night and are telling me this...</font>

492
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,380
<font color="yellow">So it seems quite true.</font>

493
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,400
<font color="yellow">Is it true then?</font>

494
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

495
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,730
<font color="yellow">I will believe it then.</font>

496
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,630
<font color="yellow">Do you know that
I keep a diary these days?</font>

497
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,520
<font color="yellow">Because I'm touched every day.</font>

498
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,710
<font color="yellow">It's the first time that the man
I'm crazy in love with...</font>

499
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,330
<font color="yellow">crazily fills me with love.</font>

500
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,400
<font color="yellow">So I write in my journal every day.</font>

501
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,560
<font color="yellow">I feel I should save such moments.</font>

502
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:31,480
<font color="yellow">I love every day. So I'd be still happy
even if I were to die today.</font>

503
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,630
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

504
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,810
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

505
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,990
<font color="yellow">Ask him to come in for breakfast.</font>

506
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,170
<font color="yellow">What kind of fate is this?</font>

507
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,670
<font color="yellow">When are you returning?</font>

508
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,760
<font color="yellow">I will know for sure
when I get there.</font>

509
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,380
<font color="yellow">I need to meet
with the Chinese in person.</font>

510
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,750
<font color="yellow">It's too frustrating to keep
sending documents only.</font>

511
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,840
<font color="yellow">When you're about to get on the plane,
why check the weather on the west sea?</font>

512
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,880
<font color="yellow">Seize it all.</font>

513
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,920
<font color="yellow">What's happened?</font>

514
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,320
<font color="yellow">Lee Chan Soo took everything and fled.</font>

515
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,110
<font color="yellow">He ripped you off too.</font>

516
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,400
<font color="yellow">While you were overseas
working on the foreign markets</font>

517
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,900
<font color="yellow">he faked our sales and received
investments from various places.</font>

518
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,860
<font color="yellow">CEO Jang noticed
and pulled out his investment.</font>

519
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,610
<font color="yellow">He didn't want you to find out.</font>

520
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,670
<font color="yellow">That's why he got you out.</font>

521
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,900
<font color="yellow"><i>CEO Jang is too tired to see you today. </i></font>

522
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,900
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

523
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
<font color="yellow"><i>[Chan Soo]</i></font>

524
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:35,750
<font color="yellow"><i>Your call is being redirected...</i></font>

525
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,840
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

526
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,090
<font color="yellow">This bastard...</font>

527
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,460
<font color="yellow">Wait until I catch you.</font>

528
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,710
<font color="yellow">Chan Soo, where are you going?</font>

529
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,760
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

530
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,320
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to take your flight?</font>

531
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,250
<font color="yellow">Chan Soo!</font>

532
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,550
<font color="yellow">I really thought
our business was doing well.</font>

533
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,940
<font color="yellow">I really thought our product
was selling like hotcakes.</font>

534
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,320
<font color="yellow">Was it worth that much?</font>

535
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
<font color="yellow">Did I ever want to have a business?</font>

536
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,710
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to get the money and run.</font>

537
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,980
<font color="yellow">- You're out of your mind, huh?
- I'm sorry, but...</font>

538
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,840
<font color="yellow">Say it politely, you punk!</font>

539
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,090
<font color="yellow">All right then. I'm sorry.</font>

540
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:17,400
<font color="yellow">You talked the directors into suing me?</font>

541
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,090
<font color="yellow">Was it you who sent me to prison?</font>

542
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:22,260
<font color="yellow">You could've just stepped down as CEO.</font>

543
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,010
<font color="yellow">When you were about to marry someone</font>

544
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,070
<font color="yellow">why did you have to put up such a fight?</font>

545
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,730
<font color="yellow">I was putting up a fight
because I was about to marry.</font>

546
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:33,340
<font color="yellow">Plus, does it make sense that
I'm not the CEO of Tae Jin Corp?</font>

547
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,420
<font color="yellow">CEO, my butt.</font>

548
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,110
<font color="yellow">Did you really think
our product would sell well?</font>

549
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:42,480
<font color="yellow">You're so slow that...</font>

550
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,840
<font color="yellow">CEO Jang drags you around
for his errands.</font>

551
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
<font color="yellow">What, you punk?</font>

552
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:53,460
<font color="yellow">You and Park Do Kyung both
are being played by CEO Jang.</font>

553
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,690
<font color="yellow">As if one of you is a white stone
and the other is a black stone.</font>

554
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,300
<font color="yellow">He scored in love at least.</font>

555
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,730
<font color="yellow">You're such a loser though.</font>

556
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,960
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere today.</font>

557
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,550
<font color="yellow">Today? I can't leave right away today.</font>

558
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,860
<font color="yellow">Can we leave Friday night?</font>

559
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,900
<font color="yellow">No, let's go today.</font>

560
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,510
<font color="yellow">I got it. See you later.</font>

561
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,150
<font color="yellow"><i>- I'm just asking out of curiosity.</i>..
- Okay.</font>

562
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,960
<font color="yellow">Do you know where I live,
by any chance?</font>

563
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,960
<font color="yellow">Who are you? Why do you
keep popping into my head?</font>

564
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,340
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep seeing you?</font>

565
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,530
<font color="yellow">Did you eavesdrop on me?</font>

566
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:23,760
<font color="yellow">Even if you did, you wouldn't
know who was who.</font>

567
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,800
<font color="yellow"><i>What is it?</i></font>

568
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,050
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought about
the possibility of me dying...</i></font>

569
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,340
<font color="yellow"><i>I told him this.</i></font>

570
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,110
<font color="yellow"><i>If he ever wants to marry you,
come to Suh Hee's wedding. </i></font>

571
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,690
<font color="yellow"><i>If not, don't show up.</i></font>

572
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,690
<font color="yellow">That bastard didn't show up!</font>

573
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,630
<font color="yellow"><i>If I look back at
this moment when I'm dying</i></font>

574
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,760
<font color="yellow"><i>it means nothing.
No need to be cautious.</i></font>

575
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,420
<font color="yellow">I will let myself go
as far as my heart wants.</font>

576
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,840
<font color="yellow">I won't hold back
and will let myself go.</font>

577
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I couldn't
come to the wedding.</font>

578
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
<font color="yellow">I had my reasons.</font>

579
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,360
<font color="yellow">Until I die</font>

580
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,960
<font color="yellow">I won't leave your side.</font>

581
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,170
<font color="yellow"><i>I won't ask you to forgive me.</i></font>

582
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,860
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry.</i></font>

583
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,710
<font color="yellow"><i>No. It can't be. </i></font>

584
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,590
<font color="yellow"><i>It won't be, Hae Young.</i></font>

585
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,670
<font color="yellow"><i>It won't be.</i></font>

586
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,110
<font color="yellow"><i>I fell for him first.</i></font>

587
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,710
<font color="yellow"><i>I begged him to love me back.</i></font>

588
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Just don't beat him up.
I'm begging you.</i></font>

589
