<i>[Another Oh Hae Young]</i>

3
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,740
<i>Let's go.</i>

4
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:22,680
<i>Let's go all the way.</i>

5
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:42,100
<i>[Episode 11: In pain, in pain...]</i>

6
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:14,225
Hae Young isn't picking up her phone.

7
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,985
Why would she answer your calls?

8
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,700
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,771
I've done wrong.

10
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:38,082
There's no need for you to be like this.
Leave.

11
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,546
I can't accept you.

12
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,797
Get up, okay?
Come on. Get up.

13
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:59,260
I heard you've been through a lot.

14
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,527
How did this even happen to you?

15
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,952
Hae Young probably slept over
at her Pyngchang-dong place.

16
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,029
She's been living there
by herself for some time now.

17
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:16,255
<i>Hurry up and come in!
What are you doing?</i>

18
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,950
All right!

19
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,546
I... Just...

20
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:59,878
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks.

21
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,613
My entire body aches.
It feels like I've just traveled abroad.

22
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,700
You should take the morning off
if you're too tired.

23
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,445
Isadora will kill me if I do.
I have to notify her well in advance.

24
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:18,233
Oh my! I'm late. I need to get ready
and go! I'll see you after work!

25
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,248
I'll see you later.

26
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:48,883
I've been doing fine these days.
Is this "Memento" or something?

27
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:53,553
Oh my. Where is it?
Hey. Where did I leave my car?

28
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,310
Haven't you seen it?

29
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:03,298
Are you going to work
or coming back from it?

30
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,616
My goodness.

31
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,092
I need to...

32
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:16,342
have a go at Park Do Kyung today
and leave the house.

33
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:20,500
But...

34
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,572
you've made me look ridiculous like this.
What am I supposed to do?

35
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:30,361
Hey.
What time did I come home last night?

36
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,099
I said what time did I come home?

37
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,921
How would I know?
I don't even know when I came home.

38
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,782
Let me use your phone.

39
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,500
Hey. Is Attorney Kim there?

40
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Let me talk to him.

41
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:00,563
Hey. Who in the world
did I drink with yesterday?

42
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:04,178
I don't have my phone. Or my car.

43
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:07,019
I don't have anything. What's going on?

44
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,483
- Sorry.
- Do it properly! With your two hands!

45
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:34,253
Please put some on for me.

46
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:36,200
Have you lost it?
Don't you have hands?

47
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,246
I'm going to temporarily
pretend like I don't have one.

48
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,318
I wake up and find out
this is what she has done to me.

49
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,347
She says she'll kill me
if I remove them.

50
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,787
I was going to fabulously
have a go at you and leave.

51
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:58,897
But it's embarrassing to do so
with this hand.

52
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:02,803
And it would be funny to do so
with one hand behind my back.

53
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:05,575
That's why
I'm not leaving the house today.

54
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,426
Just come at me. Then leave.

55
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,645
I can't just have a go at you.
That won't look cool.

56
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm going to do it the right way.

57
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:18,101
I've planned all of my movements out.

58
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:20,834
I've meticulously thought out
my facial expressions too.

59
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,654
You just wait.

60
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,090
Once I get these removed

61
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,046
I'm going to have a go at you.
The right way.

62
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,859
Maybe you two should fight
with gloves on.

63
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,606
Do you want me to give you
some leather gloves?

64
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,066
I feel like I shouldn't
fight with him now.

65
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,791
I just get this vibe.

66
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:48,257
Apparently my car is parked
in front of Yanyang Prison.

67
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,900
Why did they say you went that far?

68
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,277
According to my witnesses
from our gathering...

69
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:58,012
With a gold digger
who was on a prison furlough...

70
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,553
Who called you a gold digger?

71
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:11,551
Honey, you're just a flower.

72
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,815
A flower. A flower.

73
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,991
Apparently I tried to get her released.
Begging and crying...

74
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,516
That's what I did before letting her go.

75
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,957
You piece of trash.

76
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,313
You. Go back to your house.

77
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:40,514
Don't set a foot in this house!
You're dirty.

78
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,784
What do you mean dirty? Hm?

79
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,457
Don't you think that's
taking things too far?

80
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,086
How flawlessly clean are you?
You had a thing with a married man!

81
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,699
- I was at least in love!
- I was the one who was in love!

82
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:55,327
- I was in love at that moment!
- Really? Because I was the one in love!

83
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,520
- Do you hear me!
- You never do!

84
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:00,630
No, no, no.

85
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,337
You're always yapping!
Always!

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,886
- I'm here to see Ms. Oh Hae Young.
- Please hold on.

87
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:22,334
Which Oh Hae Young?
There are two of them.

88
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,268
I'm here to see
Assistant Manager Oh Hae Young.

89
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:26,327
Please hold on.

90
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:30,164
Someone is here for Assistant Manager Oh.
Could you check if she's here?

91
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:32,707
Okay. I've got it.

92
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,002
- She's not here yet.
- Is that so?

93
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:38,869
All right.

94
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:45,833
Hello.

95
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,744
We've met before with Hae Young.

96
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,103
Is that so?

97
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:57,865
Who is he?

98
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:01,858
The man Hae Young was going to marry.
I've seen him a couple of times.

99
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,161
- Let's go, Manager Oh.
- All right. Let's go.

100
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,698
<i>Are you still mad at me?</i>

101
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:53,699
<i>I thought you had forgiven me.</i>

102
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,110
<i>Do I need to beg you more
for forgiveness?</i>

103
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,260
<i>I will. Until your anger subsides.</i>

104
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,770
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

105
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:13,802
<i>Let's meet up tonight.
I have something to tell you.</i>

106
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,699
Let's hang out tonight after work.

107
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,799
I think I'll be a little late today.

108
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,799
<i>Why?</i>

109
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:55,199
I'm meeting up with someone.

110
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,275
- Will you be late?
<i>- I don't think I'll be that late.</i>

111
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,328
I'm briefly meeting with

112
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:06,400
the guy I was going to marry.

113
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:12,794
It's not that we got back together,
but we did kind of see each other.

114
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:16,805
So I think I should meet with him
and end things.

115
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,237
See me before you meet with him.

116
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,196
<i>Finishing things off
with him comes first.</i>

117
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:21,740
I should come first. Talk to me first.

118
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,400
<i>It won't take long. It'll be brief.</i>

119
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Meet with me first.
I have something to tell you.

120
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,600
What's with you all of a sudden?

121
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,131
Talk to me first.
I'll stop by your work.

122
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:34,415
Did you plan something for tonight?

123
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:37,654
Was I supposed to dress up
all nice and pretty today?

124
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,506
I'm telling you this ahead of time.

125
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,606
Don't do things like bringing flowers
and getting down on your knees.

126
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:45,699
So embarrassing...

127
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,582
<i>And don't plan things with
the staff at a restaurant either.</i>

128
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,832
<i>Don't put on a weird show
in front of a lot of people.</i>

129
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:53,619
I just can't understand women
who like those things.

130
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:58,760
- Stop overreacting.
- All right.

131
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,187
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

132
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,161
<i>I won't push you away anymore</i>

133
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:24,911
<i>out of guilt.</i>

134
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,900
<i>I just want to love you.</i>

135
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,770
<i>No matter what I tell you</i>

136
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,322
<i>please don't abandon me.</i>

137
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:35,116
<i>Please hold onto me tightly.</i>

138
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:40,419
You blew me off yesterday too.
What's wrong?

139
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,800
- Let's hang out for a little bit.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

140
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's meet up tomorrow.

141
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,207
I'll keep my promise tomorrow.
For sure.

142
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:51,233
I have something to tell you too.

143
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,692
Not even for a few minutes?

144
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:55,038
Let's meet up tomorrow. I'm sorry.

145
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:59,178
I don't get why I have to
keep apologizing to you.

146
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:02,544
All right. I'll see you tomorrow then.

147
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:05,823
<i>- No need for you to be sorry.</i>
- All right.

148
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,876
I've got it.

149
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:14,481
It's ready.

150
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,068
<i>I just want to give something
to you before I go.</i>

151
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,438
<i>I'll see you in front of your workplace.</i>

152
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:03,966
I'll get going then.
See you guys tomorrow.

153
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,120
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

154
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,694
I'm outside. Where are you?

155
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you all right?

156
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:04,746
<i>At least tell me why
you're doing this to me.</i>

157
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,446
What have I ever done to you?

158
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,457
I've looked into everything,
but I couldn't find anything.

159
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:12,015
You aren't related to me in any way.

160
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:14,621
Why the hell did you ruin my business?

161
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,303
You bastard! You bastard.

162
00:16:57,446 --> 00:17:00,030
What are you doing?
Let go! Let go of him!

163
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:03,736
Hae Young.

164
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,435
Get away from that bastard.

165
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,451
I said get away from him!

166
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,300
Who do you think you are?
Punching this guy!

167
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,066
Do you still think I'm your fiancée?

168
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:21,499
Since when were you two this close?

169
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,871
Why should I tell you?

170
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:28,196
This is the bastard
who ruined my business.

171
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:33,286
He's the one who ruined my business
and made me go to jail!

172
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Hey.

173
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:52,105
Did you send me to jail
because you liked her?

174
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,908
Is that it?

175
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,373
To prevent us from getting married?

176
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:52,505
I went to see CEO Jang,
who ruined my business.

177
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:55,874
I asked him why he would retrieve
his investment for no reason.

178
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,781
Then this is what CEO Jang told me.

179
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,829
He said that bastard Park Do Kyung
had asked him to do it.

180
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:04,707
I thought long and hard about it,
but he and I weren't involved in any way.

181
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:08,553
There was this one thing
a lawyer told me while I was in jail.

182
00:19:08,553 --> 00:19:11,033
He said Park Do Kyung did what he did

183
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,545
because he thought
I was getting married to Oh Hae Young.

184
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,611
My "Hae" is written like this.

185
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,130
Oh Hae Young.

186
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,857
Hae Young.

187
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:27,493
How do you know that bastard?
How long have you known him?

188
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:31,515
How long have you known him?
Did you know that he liked you?

189
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,170
It wasn't me.

190
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,296
What do you mean?

191
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,740
It wasn't me.

192
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,400
Let's go.

193
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,150
I'll explain everything.

194
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,993
You're a man! How could you stab another
man in the back and steal his woman?

195
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,569
Stand up, you bastard.

196
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,073
Get up!

197
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,663
Are you a human being? Huh? Are you?

198
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,199
How could you laugh hysterically
after breaking off your marriage?

199
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,100
<i>[Dad is now abandoning you.
Mom has agreed. Live well. With decency.]</i>

200
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:39,047
<i>So all those things I've been through</i>

201
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:41,600
<i>were because of Oh Hae Young?</i>

202
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:51,197
<i>Because Park Do Kyung</i>

203
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:54,262
<i>was in love with Oh Hae Young?</i>

204
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,400
<i>[The Man Next Door]</i>

205
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,100
<i>[15 missed calls]</i>

206
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:21,485
Who were you in a fight with?

207
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,627
You look cool.

208
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:31,688
<i>Tell me. Tell me right now.</i>

209
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>I won't be as shocked
if you tell me right now.</i>

210
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:46,644
<i>Before I fall for you even more,
tell me right now.</i>

211
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,734
Why did you call your wedding off
the day before, big sis?

212
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:10,865
You...

213
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,410
You!

214
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,563
You!

215
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,224
You!

216
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,204
You!

217
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:16,507
Where are you going?

218
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:24,168
Where are you headed?

219
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,842
Hello, sir.

220
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,932
Hey. Park Hoon. Where...

221
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:19,234
- Why are we doing this?
- I don't know.

222
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:48,256
She broke off her wedding
with Do Kyung like that

223
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,746
and was about to get married
to another man?

224
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:52,936
What a bitch!

225
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,688
Good for Do Kyung for
breaking the wedding up.

226
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:57,355
You idiots.
Have you been listening to me?

227
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:59,108
He didn't break off
that Oh Hae Young's wedding.

228
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,901
He broke off another
Oh Hae Young's wedding!

229
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,363
Who's another Oh Hae Young?

230
00:28:03,363 --> 00:28:07,110
- There are two Oh Hae Youngs. Two!
- How could there be two of them?

231
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,262
- Does she repeat what the other says?
- They have the same name! You idiot!

232
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:12,358
You should have said that
from the beginning!

233
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:16,242
We were confused because you said
there are two Oh Hae Youngs we know!

234
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:18,644
So that Oh Hae Young was
playing a double role?

235
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:20,596
I thought you had understood everything.

236
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:22,400
Also, get that nail art removed!

237
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,208
- So annoying.
- She said she'll kill me if I do!

238
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:28,059
So whose wedding
did he break up exactly?

239
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,198
So to be clear, he broke up the wedding
of a stranger! That Oh Hae Young!

240
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:33,449
So what's the problem then?

241
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:35,557
She wasn't the woman he loved
and was a complete stranger.

242
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:37,919
But the problem is
Do Kyung has fallen for her.

243
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,226
He likes her now. Okay?

244
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,888
But you said that's not
the woman he likes!

245
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,563
Anyway, that's what has happened!
So we're...

246
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:45,255
Hey. Forget it.
Don't try to understand it.

247
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:48,860
- Don't you dare try to understand it!
- This is the most difficult thing ever!

248
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,184
- It's so freaking confusing.
- I've understood everything.

249
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,305
Seriously?
Do you understand all of this?

250
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:58,979
So ultimately, what we have to do is
just kidnap the person he wants to see.

251
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:00,679
Which Oh Hae Young
are you going to kidnap?

252
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,499
- You're going to complicate things more.
- Of course the prettier one.

253
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,889
You're going to complicate things
even more that way!

254
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:10,391
Does he like the ugly one?

255
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:29,488
I think I started this whole mess.

256
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:33,246
I told it to Park Do Kyung.

257
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:37,537
My friend has gotten very lucky.

258
00:29:37,537 --> 00:29:41,062
He was even on the news and stuff.
His name is CEO Han Tae Jin.

259
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,124
Which high school did she go to?

260
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:46,026
That's right. He even asked me
which high school you went to.

261
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:49,832
He must have thought

262
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:51,996
you were that Oh Hae Young.

263
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:54,902
Oh no...

264
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,199
I'm sorry.

265
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,073
I'm so sorry.

266
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,173
What to do...

267
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,948
I've found Oh Hae Young.
You know who I am.

268
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,544
Hurry up and come over here.

269
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,922
Park Hoon! It's not that Oh Hae Young!
You idiot!

270
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,957
Hey! Pick him up! Quickly!

271
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:46,772
Bunch of idiots!

272
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:50,083
Don't do anything! So useless!

273
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,445
So are we just going to
chase after Do Kyung all night long?

274
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,323
We need to do something!

275
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:56,765
Aren't you a lawyer? What are you doing?

276
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:20,865
We were all supposed to get away today!

277
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,573
- Have you forgotten about it already?
- Have you?

278
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:25,755
- Hurry. Come on! Let's go!
- Let's go.

279
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:28,736
- Come on! Hurry!
- Let's go.

280
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,190
- Step on the gas.
- Here we go!

281
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,143
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Yeah!

282
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,958
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

283
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:47,757
Go! Go! Charge forward!

284
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:01,822
Hey. The sun has risen.

285
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:05,463
Hey. Wake up!
Wake up! Get up!

286
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:08,320
Wow! It's the beach!

287
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,560
- Nice! The beach!
- Yay!

288
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,765
Do Kyung. Get up. We're at the beach.

289
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:20,022
- We're at the beach!
- The beach!

290
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Don't you even think about it.
I'm going to kill you.

291
00:32:54,214 --> 00:32:55,901
All right.

292
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,541
Take his clothes off! Go! Go!

293
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,699
Just like the wave that comes and goes

294
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:48,486
women come and go too.

295
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:51,804
You're with them one moment.
Then you're not the next.

296
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:56,028
Damn. Your comment sucks.
This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

297
00:33:56,028 --> 00:33:58,900
That was a little
embarrassing for me too.

298
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,852
But we need to say something!

299
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:03,916
- Should I just do nothing then?
- Yeah. Stop being gross.

300
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,055
Fine. I won't do anything.
You all try to console him then.

301
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:09,950
- Console him for what?
- Don't you know?

302
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,782
We've come all this way because
Director Park got dumped by a woman!

303
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,057
- Hey!
- What?

304
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:16,327
- My goodness!
- I've been dumped over 20 times!

305
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:18,381
What? What now?

306
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:20,023
Hey. Step on him! Come on!

307
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:25,247
That's enough. You might kill him.

308
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,265
Hey. There are women at 9 o'clock.

309
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:34,026
- Hey! Hey! There are women!
- You're like an animal.

310
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:49,822
Have you lost something by chance?

311
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,287
That ideal type
you've been searching for.

312
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,084
Don't you think
you'll find him over there?

313
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,200
Hey, there are three more ladies.

314
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,570
We have the perfect matching number.

315
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,369
You go have fun.

316
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,999
We won't have enough men
if you don't join us.

317
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,700
Just sit there and do nothing, okay?

318
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:23,700
The fact that we've met
as a group of six on this beach

319
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,919
means that we were destined to meet.

320
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,630
- I'm Lee Jin Sang.
- I'm Oh Hae Young.

321
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,919
- Pardon?
- I'm Oh Hae Young.

322
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:36,019
As in Hae.

323
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,749
Is your real name seriously Oh Hae Young?

324
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,269
Yes.

325
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:56,369
- Seriously as in Hae?
- Yes.

326
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,200
- So what happened? Hurry up.
- Say it now.

327
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,510
Assistant Manager Oh
went after Manager Oh.

328
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:38,900
I really thought
she was going to kill her.

329
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,700
Do you know why she did that?
There had to be a reason.

330
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,110
I have no idea why.

331
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,200
She came back and just cried.

332
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,209
She was actually like a crazy woman.

333
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,717
- <i>Your call is being redirected...</i>
- Gosh.

334
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:52,939
Her phone is switched off.

335
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:55,669
I wonder what Manager Oh did to her.

336
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,639
What a bitch.

337
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,749
Something must have happened
between you two.

338
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:22,430
- You were beat up without a reason?
- I don't know.

339
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,300
So you're saying that
she did that without a reason?

340
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,910
Isn't it always the fault of
the person who threw a punch first?

341
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,099
Why are you taking her side?

342
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,110
What do you mean I'm taking her side?

343
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,110
Since she isn't here

344
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm asking you instead.

345
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,180
You know I wouldn't do something bad
enough to someone to deserve an attack.

346
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,419
Then why are you taking her side?

347
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,970
Why do you keep saying
that I'm taking her side?

348
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,880
You are taking her side.

349
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,650
Every time.

350
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,760
You know that it's not true that
I left because I didn't love Do Kyung.

351
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,229
Then why are you acting so harsh?

352
00:38:03,229 --> 00:38:06,119
When you're this harsh to me

353
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,479
why are you taking her side
when you have no relation to her?

354
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,919
<i>Explain to me why you did
what you did yesterday.</i>

355
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,880
<i>You need to explain.</i>

356
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,789
If you eat that uncooked ramen
and drink water like that

357
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:05,939
your stomach will feel bad.

358
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,209
What is it? Tell me.

359
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,840
What is it now?

360
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,329
- Mom.
- What?

361
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,800
When I was in high school

362
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,189
do you remember there was
another girl with the same name?

363
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,979
I remember.

364
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,340
What about it?

365
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:31,090
- What was she like?
- What do you mean?

366
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,280
She had big round eyes.

367
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:35,619
What about her?

368
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:37,740
Why suddenly her?

369
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,860
All the boys liked her.

370
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,439
Because of the boys who liked her,
our windows were smashed a lot.

371
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,110
Bitch! Have a good life!

372
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,519
Hey! The pretty Oh Hae Young
doesn't live here!

373
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:07,229
The plain Oh Hae Young lives here!

374
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,300
What is odd is...

375
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:15,010
I never received
candy or flowers by mistake.

376
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,860
How come a rock smashed
our windows every time?

377
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,260
Don't you think it's odd?

378
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,590
It seems that I was born to
take all the bad luck for her.

379
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,829
Crazy. What nonsense.

380
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:25,039
Who says you are, huh?

381
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,419
If the universe weren't on my side

382
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,930
wouldn't it make me so pathetic?

383
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,499
I'm on your side.
Why would you be pathetic?

384
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,619
Mom, let's move.

385
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:39,840
To a rural place, not Seoul.

386
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,970
If we move to a rural place

387
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,619
wouldn't it make me seem
like a better catch?

388
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,889
If I live in a place where
no one is better than me

389
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:51,729
wouldn't it help me
feel good about myself?

390
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:55,039
What is it? What happened?

391
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,039
Tell me what it is.

392
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,849
Don't just keep it to yourself
and tell me this time.

393
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,329
I was crying for my friend last night.

394
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:11,800
My eyes are all puffy today.
I tend to get puffy easily.

395
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,400
I read your scenario.

396
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,010
You didn't learn how to write
a scenario professionally, did you?

397
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,180
- No, it wasn't my major at all.
- Fine.

398
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,189
Scenarios written by people
who were trained are kind of boring.

399
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:31,079
They often use boring lines
and obvious characters.

400
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,160
This needs some modification.

401
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:37,610
But I'm a loyal friend.

402
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,519
I don't feel comfortable working with
the brother of the guy my friend hates.

403
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,950
My friend is Oh Hae Young.

404
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,470
Park Do Kyung broke up her wedding.

405
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,470
I wonder if you know what I'm saying.

406
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,479
- I do.
- Do you?

407
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,479
- Yes.
- When did you know?

408
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:52,631
Yesterday.

409
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:56,050
Everybody found out yesterday, huh?

410
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,240
I'm really ticked off right now.

411
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,990
I'm the one who started the whole thing.

412
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,110
I'm the one who talked to
him about Oh Hae Young.

413
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,510
But is she the only
Oh Hae Young in the world?

414
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,800
It's such a common name, right?

415
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,709
Back in school, there were
five or six Hae Youngs.

416
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,809
Because he fixated on her that much

417
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,530
he thought there was only
one Oh Hae Young, huh?

418
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,660
Plus, after he broke up
her wedding like that

419
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,459
how could he lead her on
without saying anything?

420
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:21,740
Is he crazy or what?

421
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:27,660
I'm sorry to say this...

422
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,439
I was so shocked
when I heard that yesterday.

423
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:35,450
I pushed him to the ocean to kill him.

424
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,570
He survived.

425
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,570
He came out begging for forgiveness.

426
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:46,220
I told him to go beg for
her forgiveness no matter what.

427
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,709
If he weren't my brother

428
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:52,900
I would've put on a leash
on his neck and dragged him to her.

429
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,840
You should have dragged him.

430
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,059
Should I? It's not too late now.

431
00:42:58,059 --> 00:42:59,740
By the way.

432
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:04,820
What do you have on your nails?

433
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,490
- It was my girlfriend...
- Take them off. It bothers me.

434
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,860
It does, right? Should I then?

435
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,050
These don't come off easily.

436
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,709
They do come off easily.

437
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:49,070
- Hey!
- Listen to me first!

438
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,477
Listen to what?

439
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,050
Hold on!

440
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,300
Why did you take them off? Why?

441
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,119
You know how important they are.

442
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,869
Why did you take them off?

443
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,559
I had them on for three days.

444
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,559
How much longer did you want them on?

445
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:12,519
How could you do that to a guy's nails?

446
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,019
It means that you have a girlfriend.

447
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:19,139
Shall I put a tattoo on
your forehead that says you're mine?

448
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,260
I go around and tell people that.

449
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,150
I tell people that I have a girlfriend.

450
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,510
I don't need to have
such things on my nails.

451
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,459
What is it? You think I'd cheat on you?

452
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,910
Do I look like someone
who would cheat on you?

453
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,800
Yes, you do look like one.

454
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,550
- You really look like one.
- Then let's break up.

455
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,889
- You're pushing it, huh?
- You're the one who is pushing it here.

456
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:42,570
What girl would hit
a guy's head this much?

457
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,789
I'm 33 now.

458
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:47,369
I don't know how it was going out
with someone about your age.

459
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:49,369
You colored the nails of
a 33-year-old man.

460
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:52,689
You hit me with a book.
I won't tolerate such behavior!

461
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:02,900
I told you not to leave me after a fight.

462
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,280
I told you that it wasn't
what a 33-year-old should do.

463
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,780
Come back. If you don't,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

464
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,780
Come back!

465
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,260
Fine! Walk away!

466
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,269
By the way, I can sense things
faster than anybody.

467
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:22,090
I already sensed something was going on.

468
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,599
Don't do anything embarrassing.

469
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,099
Okay?

470
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,530
What does she mean
she sensed something?

471
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,729
What did I ever do?

472
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:27,099
<i>[I'm sorry.]</i>

473
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:31,099
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

474
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:02,970
I waited thinking
you'd write more after "I'm sorry."

475
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,160
I thought you were taking
time to write and delete.

476
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
<i>I waited for a long time.</i>

477
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,570
I've waited for two hours.

478
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,979
How can it be one single
sentence of "I'm sorry"?

479
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,240
How can you end the sentence this way?

480
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,099
<i>You've gone mad, right?</i>

481
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,970
You don't know what's going on, do you?

482
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,789
You've gone mad, haven't you?

483
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,869
Where are you?

484
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,769
I'm sorry.

485
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,400
I was wrong.

486
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,570
I was such a coward.

487
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,280
You've managed to say
more than sorry now.

488
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,470
You must have been thinking about
more to say on your way here, huh?

489
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,240
I'm sorry.

490
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,229
Are you sorry?

491
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:28,010
I hate that sentence so much.

492
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,340
Can we go somewhere inside and talk?

493
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,240
Why? Are you embarrassed by me?

494
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,459
If I see myself in the mirror...

495
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,490
I look like a moron.

496
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,900
I deserve what happened to me.

497
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900
I look so gullible.

498
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,240
I got caught in the middle
of your love quarrel.

499
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,519
I look that naive.

500
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:58,010
I hate myself.

501
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,809
I want to have a different face
and be someone else.

502
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:04,380
So I put on this much makeup
hoping I'd feel better.

503
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:07,499
But you're saying you're sorry?

504
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:09,269
You're just sorry?

505
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,490
I'm very sorry.

506
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,050
What are you sorry about?

507
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,300
Why are you sorry?
How sorry are you?

508
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,099
Let's go somewhere and talk.

509
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:26,689
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

510
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,720
You loved Oh Hae Young, so you
wanted to break up her wedding.

511
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,400
Why didn't you tell me that you
ended up breaking up my wedding?

512
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,769
I did want to tell you.

513
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:34,749
But I couldn't do that to you
when you were already down.

514
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:37,780
You said you were compared to
Oh Hae Young all through high school.

515
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,369
You said your life was this tough.

516
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,599
You wondered how her life was.

517
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:43,840
I just couldn't tell you the truth.

518
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,990
I couldn't tell you
not to make it even worse.

519
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,249
Do you know what hurts?

520
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:53,450
You wanted to break up her wedding
until recently because you loved her.

521
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,340
You threw a rock at her,
but it ended up hitting me.

522
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,459
While I was in pain from the rock,
you were thinking about her.

523
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:03,050
I was confessing my love
for you without knowing all that.

524
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,160
When you knew that I had feelings for you

525
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,309
you should have told me everything.

526
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,760
You should've told me everything
so I could completely walk away from you.

527
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,410
Why?

528
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,189
Why did you have to lead me on this far?

529
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,800
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry.

530
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,809
I'm saying that because I'm sorry.
What else can I do?

531
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,959
I'm sorry.
I'm just so very terribly sorry.

532
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:33,010
What else can I possibly say?

533
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,930
What would others say in this situation?

534
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,539
What would be the right thing to say?
Just tell me, please.

535
00:51:55,499 --> 00:51:57,019
I'm sorry.

536
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,970
I'm... so very sorry.

537
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:10,010
Beg.

538
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,039
Beg on your knees.

539
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:22,599
- I'm sorry.
- Beg.

540
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:28,610
Beg.

541
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,229
I said beg! Come back and beg!

542
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,720
<i>You've never said anything to me.</i>

543
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,660
<i>That you loved me...</i>

544
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:38,300
<i>That you loved me...</i>

545
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,160
<i>You've never said that.</i>

546
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,729
<i>I bet you've said that to Oh Hae Young.</i>

547
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,910
Among the kids whose moms I've married

548
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:55,470
Young Joo seemed to like you.

549
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,499
I liked you because you seemed cool.

550
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:00,930
Now that I'm getting married
to Do Kyung's mom

551
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,930
wouldn't it be weird
if we continue to hang out?

552
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,470
It's weird, isn't it?

553
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,570
Let's stop hanging out.

554
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,249
Don't call me.

555
00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:13,590
It's okay if you think
I'm being too harsh.

556
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,130
No, you're not being too harsh.

557
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,249
- I understand.
- Stop having feelings for Do Kyung.

558
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:22,070
- Stop.
- I will just end our relationship.

559
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,709
I will end my relationship
with Young Joo too.

560
00:54:24,709 --> 00:54:26,809
- But with Do Kyung...
- End it.

561
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:28,950
I've married too many times.

562
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,769
My family tree is already complicated,
so don't add more to it.

563
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,240
I will just talk to him.

564
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,669
- I'm just going to talk to him.
- What is it?

565
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,450
Come in.

566
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,169
- Who are you?
- I'm Han Tae Jin.

567
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,510
Hello.

568
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,209
I met you with Hae Young a while ago.

569
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,499
Did you?

570
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,550
You look familiar.

571
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,099
You pulled out your investment
in my company because of Park Do Kyung.

572
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,939
- My company was ruined.
- Ah!

573
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:14,479
I heard that you were arrested.

574
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:17,740
- I was acquitted and released.
- I see. That's great.

575
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:19,769
I thought you were a realistic investor.

576
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:21,769
I guess you get swayed
by a couple's love quarrel.

577
00:55:21,769 --> 00:55:24,410
Don't twist your words
and just say it straightforward.

578
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,160
Gosh, this lunch has gotten
very uncomfortable.

579
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,630
I don't know if you knew.

580
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,169
But Park Do Kyung was after my fiancée
and wanted to ruin me.

581
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,119
When you had the reputation
of being a good investor

582
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,999
if the rumor gets out that
you were swayed by such a thing

583
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:43,450
it would hurt.

584
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:47,189
Wow, Do Kyung is
such a passionate man, huh?

585
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:48,939
He's just like me.

586
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:50,990
You should end it with Do Kyung.

587
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,700
I guess he is into some other woman now.

588
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,780
Is your fiancée's name Oh Hae Young?

589
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,479
You should've gotten
on your knees when she said so.

590
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:23,090
Hey, you couldn't do this?

591
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,400
You couldn't do this?

592
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,979
Why couldn't you do it?

593
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:29,430
You should be on your knees
when she says so.

594
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,689
You should get beaten up
if she throws a punch at you.

595
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:33,229
Is it a big deal that you get
embarrassed on the street now?

596
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:37,289
When I saw you yesterday,
you looked like you'd do anything.

597
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:39,130
Why couldn't you do it? Why?

598
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,439
I said I was sorry so many times.

599
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,090
Will that ever be enough?

600
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,519
You should've gotten on your knees
after saying you loved her.

601
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:47,820
You should've done
everything she asked you.

602
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,479
You should've even rolled down the
streets of Myung-dong if she asked you.

603
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:53,530
Are you sure you like her?

604
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,309
- Do you really like her?
- You don't know that?

605
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:59,880
I don't know. You don't say it.
How am I supposed to know?

606
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,860
You can't even give me a straight answer
to such a simple question.

607
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,630
Why so cautious? Why?

608
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,760
Why do you live your life that way?

609
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,820
Why wouldn't you let her in?

610
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,160
After we broke up

611
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,079
I opened my mailbox several times a day.

612
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,090
I was hoping to read
some hate mail at least.

613
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,229
I got disheartened when
I didn't hear anything from you.

614
00:57:51,229 --> 00:57:53,559
It was torture when I was
the one who dumped you.

615
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:58,479
I thought you seemed to live your life
just fine after you were dumped.

616
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:03,680
I thought to myself,
"Did I mean nothing to him?"

617
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,829
"Did he even love me?"

618
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:12,630
You thought I married
that man, didn't you?

619
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,499
That's why you made his company
go bankrupt, isn't it?

620
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,860
Thank you.

621
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,869
Now I can finally breathe...

622
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,079
Thank you.

623
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:27,300
How can you say such a thing
at a time like this?

624
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,680
I ruined someone else's life
because of you.

625
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,550
I don't care.

626
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,599
Whether you ruined
100 or 1,000 people...

627
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:39,700
You did that because you loved me.

628
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,749
You did that because of me.

629
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,880
I... still love you.

630
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,539
I love you so much.

631
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:04,900
I love you.

632
00:59:20,499 --> 00:59:22,970
I will leave first.

633
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,400
Her name is Oh Hae Young.

634
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,070
She and Do Kyung were
going to get married.

635
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,220
It wasn't me.

636
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:25,700
With that woman

637
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,599
I think it's right to end it this way.

638
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,280
Do Kyung.

639
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,470
<i>Are you okay?</i>

640
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:46,389
<i>Hey, don't touch him.</i>

641
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,400
I think it's right to end it this way.

642
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:15,249
For her.

643
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,130
I will die anyway.

644
