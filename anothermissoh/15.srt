3
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm going to scan you.

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,630
- I'm tired.
- Don't put me down. Don't.

5
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,990
Stop moving. Look straight into my eyes.

6
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,020
If you're tired,
let's finish this quickly.

7
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,380
- Here. Look. Look at me.
- My senses are tingling.

8
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,320
My senses are tingling.
My senses are tingling.

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,580
My senses are tingling.

10
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,970
I see you haven't fallen for
that seductive woman.

11
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,810
Good boy. Good job.

12
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,710
Guys who look like delinquents actually
don't act like them. Don't you know?

13
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,290
- Let's go.
- Let's head in.

14
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,050
- I guess Do Kyung hasn't come home yet?
- No.

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,000
You look like a newlywed wife
waiting for her husband.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
- So you've made some soup for him?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,440
I was just kidding.

18
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,750
That woman has lost it.

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,750
Are you crazy? How could you drink?
Have you given up on your life?

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,130
I'm pretending to be drunk.

21
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,530
- Because my body is bored.
- Oh my goodness.

22
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,450
- Let's head in.
- What did Jin Sang say?

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,860
He hasn't called you?

25
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,530
Move aside. Move!

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
He has run away.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,900
I knew he would do something like this.

28
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,370
You must have done something wrong.

29
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,370
It must be something huge.

30
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
It really must be something huge.

31
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,270
Whatever. Forget it.

32
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,170
My goodness.

33
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,410
Oh my god! Oh my!

34
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,110
You scared me!

35
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,830
- Have you eaten yet?
- No. Not yet.

36
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,060
I've made you some soup.

37
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,720
<i>[Episode 15: Those Past Days
I Couldn't Give You More, More Love]</i>

38
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,250
Wow.

39
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,490
What does it feel like?

40
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,110
Using the workspace your father
used to use for yourself.

41
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,650
Wow. How does it feel like
to use the same workspace

42
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,910
your father used to use?

43
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,810
It just seems very fancy.

44
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,110
It feels like you're carrying on
the name of a prestigious family.

45
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,700
Could I ask you...

46
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,480
when your father passed away?

47
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,370
When I was eight years old.

48
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,650
So he passed away
when you were young.

49
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,520
Did he have an illness?
<i>[Baek Il Mong - Do Kyung]</i>

50
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,440
It was from an accident.

51
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,690
It happened when he went to
record some sounds with me.

52
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,400
It must have been very shocking for you.

53
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,410
If I think about it now, I think it's
better that it happened that way.

54
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,670
I'm glad I was there when it happened.

55
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,460
I didn't let him die by himself.

56
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,100
Wouldn't dying be less scary

57
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,770
if there is someone who could
hold your hand as you die?

58
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,420
<i>You, who have come to me like a dream</i>

59
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,060
<i>on an early spring day...</i>

60
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,200
- Who's singing?
- Me.

61
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,120
<i>I thought it would last forever.</i>

62
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,320
This is what my dad recorded for me
when I was six years old.

63
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,740
- <i>The sand castle full of happiness.</i>
- My sister is playing the piano.

64
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,770
<i>It got washed away with a wave.</i>

65
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,670
<i>You may leave me.</i>

66
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,260
<i>You may forget about me.</i>

67
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,340
<i>I will have this one heart, only you.</i>

68
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,170
Oh my god. It feels so weird.

69
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,890
<i>I regret those past days.</i>

70
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,270
- <i>I couldn't give you more, more love.</i>
- So this kid is the guy I like, right?

71
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,960
- It feels like he's alive right now too.
- He is alive. Right here.

72
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,260
<i>The dream I can't wake up from.</i>

73
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,580
<i>The daydream.</i>
Oh my. What to do?

74
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,360
He's so bravely singing without
even knowing what the lyrics mean.

75
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,510
<i>I will love you</i>

76
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,630
<i>forever.</i>

77
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,670
<i>That beach on that summer night.</i>

78
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,540
<i>The sand castle full of happiness.</i>

79
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,600
I was confused in the beginning too.

80
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,070
He looks perfectly normal.

81
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,190
But he kept on telling me
he could see these visions.

82
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,730
Then all those visions came true.

83
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,400
Wait. No. Not all of them.
Some of them didn't come true.

84
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,060
That's the problem.

85
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,030
Before dying...

86
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,660
I was thinking about that woman.

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,090
<i>Since the moment I've first met her</i>

88
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,300
<i>I've regretted every moment.</i>

89
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,140
<i>Why couldn't I...</i>

90
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,030
<i>give her more, more love?</i>

91
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,010
<i>Because that remorseful
feeling is so strong</i>

92
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,180
<i>maybe it has pierced through time</i>

93
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,900
and revealed itself
in the present.

94
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,610
Have you heard about
reaching enlightenment

95
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,990
at the moment of one's death?

96
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,510
Everyone clearly sees it
at their moment of death.

97
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,770
That they had nothing to fear.

98
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,400
- That's when you've realized it, right?
- Yes.

99
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,980
Human emotions can be divided
into two categories.

100
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,800
Love or fear.

101
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,680
One of them is genuine
and the other one is fake.

102
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,100
You've found out about what's genuine.

103
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,070
So your circumstances changed
when you decided to turn to love.

104
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,860
But why are you being hesitant?

105
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,930
Why are you ending our session so soon?

106
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,650
- You should have put him under hypnosis.
- It's all useless.

107
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,950
He knows which path
he's supposed to take.

108
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,070
He just came here
because he's temporarily scared.

109
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,120
He'll go down that path again.

110
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,530
But still...

111
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,910
Why do you think I've come
all this way to see you?

112
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,330
- Try some other place then.
- My goodness!

113
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,430
<i>I regret those past days.</i>

114
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,210
<i>I couldn't give you more, more love.</i>

115
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,480
Let's listen to it one more time.

116
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,220
- Let's listen to something else.
- Just one more time.

117
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,390
Why not?

118
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,370
<i>Mother and older sister</i>

119
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,600
<i>let's live by the riverside.</i>

120
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,160
- No way.
- That's right. It's Soo Kyung.

121
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,280
<i>The shining, golden sand.</i>

122
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,100
Wow.

123
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,190
<i>Outside the back door...</i>

124
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,480
This little girl.

125
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,660
<i>Mother and older sister</i>

126
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,890
<i>let's live by the riverside.</i>

127
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,520
Park Soo Kyung, who used to be so cute.

128
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,250
Where have you flown away to?

129
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,260
Where have you flown away to?

130
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,350
Smile! Put on a smile!

131
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,150
We look so pretty!

132
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,170
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,250
Welcome to our housewarming party!

134
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,020
Welcome to our housewarming party!

135
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,480
Their bathroom is clean and nice.

136
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,940
- Where's the bathroom?
- Over there.

137
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,440
I would like to say just a few words.

138
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
In our house, you squat down and pee.

139
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,790
You'll die if you spill it anywhere.
Be careful.

140
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,900
Ta da. Look here. Over here.

141
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,820
Honey, you look so pretty.

142
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,660
You scared me!

143
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,770
I thought you would run away.
I'm surprised you came home.

144
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,500
You're more responsible than I thought.

145
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,690
I guess it's hard to ignore
your blood-related family.

146
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,190
Hey! You animal!

147
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,860
How did this happen between you two?

148
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,330
If I knew how,
that would mean my memory is intact.

149
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,970
If I did what I did
with impaired awareness...

150
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,640
then I'm a complete lunatic.

151
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,210
Maybe you go around causing
trouble like this everywhere.

152
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,960
Stop it. I'm more serious than ever.

153
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,450
Serious my ass.

154
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,010
I know you. You'll linger
for a little bit and run away.

155
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,030
- Run away?
- It's fine. I completely understand.

156
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,120
I'm not old-fashioned. I'm not going to
side with my family and all that.

157
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,960
I know how you feel.

158
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,310
It'd be too bad for you to end your life
because of Park Soo Kyung at your age.

159
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,280
You should try to make
some sort of an appeal.

160
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,090
Just do what's enough and leave.

161
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,410
Do what's enough and leave?

162
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,460
My sister isn't old-fashioned either.

163
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,550
She'll take what she deserves
and let you go freely.

164
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,240
Look at this rude bastard.

165
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,790
What would she take?
A kid isn't some sort of an object.

166
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,430
How could we make calculations?

167
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you really want to talk like
a delinquent? About your sister?

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,490
A delinquent...

169
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,590
You're being ridiculous.
I was being considerate. How dare you.

170
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,110
What is it? Were you shocked?
Because I've read your mind?

171
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,340
I'm already mad enough.

172
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,000
- Would you like to fight me?
- Sure! Let's go! Come on!

173
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,830
- How dare you!
- Ouch. Hey! Hey! Hey!

174
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,910
This bastard.
I've been going easy on you.

175
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
Park Hoon!

176
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,160
You. Didn't I tell you I'll kill you
if you disrespect Jin Sang ever again?

177
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,430
It's just that he called me a delinquent.

178
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,700
I've done wrong.

179
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,560
You. Didn't I tell you to get
treated properly for your age?

180
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,920
You! You!

181
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,340
You are going to
kill this bastard today.

182
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,550
If they keep coming at you,
you need to kill them.

183
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,730
If you go easy on them,
they'll keep coming at you again.

184
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,070
Before they keep coming for you,
clearly finish them off!

185
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,130
Until you've killed this bastard

186
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,780
you can't leave this room.

187
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,240
Cleanly finish him off.

188
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,170
Die.

189
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,950
Brother-in-law.

190
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,750
- I've done wrong.
- Brother-in...

191
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,310
I'm not your brother-in-law!

192
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm just like an older brother!

193
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,470
This isn't just horrible
and awkward for you.

194
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,400
It's like that for me too.

195
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,420
No need for you to get serious.

196
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,980
You and I could never
be a married couple.

197
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,710
You are aware of this. I am too.

198
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,660
You've been like a little brother
for the past 20 years.

199
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,770
And I've been like an older sister.

200
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,660
I'm going to move to another country

201
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,860
and you can freely
live your life just like now.

202
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,230
So stop lingering here.

203
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,100
Pack your stuff and move out.

204
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,140
Just move out. It's okay.

205
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,630
It's my baby.

206
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,800
You.

207
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,760
Could you ever kiss me?

208
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,700
I'll give you one day.

209
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,720
Think about whether
you could kiss me or not.

210
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,840
Then...

211
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,540
You'll have your answer.

212
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,920
- Oh my.
- Get out of my way!

213
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,900
- Do they both have to take a dump?
- Be careful. You might trip.

214
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,740
How gross.

215
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,090
<i>[A Castle Within the Forest]</i>

216
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,160
Why isn't he coming out?

217
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,610
- Are you creating your shit?
- How gross. What did he eat?

June 10, 2016]</i>

223
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,570
I didn't think you'd actually come.
I thought you said it out of politeness.

224
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,100
This situation is just...

225
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,670
You can't judge a person
after seeing them once.

226
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,000
Thank you.

227
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,330
So I'm grateful to you right now for...

228
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,060
For being so pretty.

229
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,150
I'm probably the only one
who feels this way. I'm sorry.

230
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,300
<i>Thank you.</i>

231
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,690
Oh my. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be checking my phone.

232
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,830
- Oh no. It's okay. Check it if you want.
- Should I turn it off?

233
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,430
Sure. It'd be nice if
you could turn it off.

234
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll turn it off.

235

<i>[Power Off]</i>

236
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,410
Thank you.

237
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,350
- It feels refreshing.
- Park Hoon. Should I drive?

238
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,480
Who else would drive?
I'm not licensed to drive this.

239
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,840
Come. Hurry.

240
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,570
<i>You're getting married tomorrow.
How do you feel?</i>

241
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,330
<i>I feel weird saying this, but my parents
are both extremely nervous right now.</i>

242
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,990
<i>Maybe I should break it off
like you the day before.</i>

243
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,170
<i>Be clear. I didn't break it off.
I was dumped.</i>

244
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,210
<i>I guess you feel fine about it now?
You're telling people you got dumped.</i>

245
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,760
<i>Of course I'm fine.</i>

246
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,810
<i>My friend who was supposed
to catch my bouquet</i>

247
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,340
<i>is upset and crying because she
and her boyfriend broke up.</i>

248
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,750
<i>Now I can't ask her to
catch my bouquet.</i>

249
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,120
<i>No worries. I'll catch it for you.</i>

250
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,090
<i>Huh? For real?</i>

251
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,720
<i>Are you coming to my wedding?</i>

252
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,670
<i>Of course. Why wouldn't I?
You're getting married.</i>

253
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,890
<i>Mom said you weren't coming.</i>

254
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,030
<i>Your mom said you weren't coming either.</i>

255
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,860
<i>Don't worry.
I'll go and catch your bouquet.</i>

256
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,690
<i>- Are you really going to come?
- Yeah. What's wrong?</i>

257
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>I just don't want you to
feel uncomfortable.</i>

258
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,140
<i>Why would I be?</i>

259
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,420
<i>You know, about what
you said on the radio.</i>

260
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,010
<i>Everyone knows how strangely
your wedding was ruined.</i>

261
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,500
<i>The conclusion is...</i>

262
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>I'm dating the man
who ruined my wedding.</i>

263
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,010
<i>- For real?
- Yes. For real.</i>

264
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,210
<i>So I'll catch your bouquet.</i>

265
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,950
<i>I'll be catching it, ma'am.</i>

266
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,420
<i>This is awesome.
I'm curious to know what he looks like.</i>

267
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,640
<i>All right then. I'll bring him
to the wedding tomorrow.</i>

268
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,050
<i>You'll be surprised, ma'am.
He's a keeper.</i>

269
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,370
<i>Even his hands are sexy.</i>

270
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,490
<i>Thinking about him
makes me miss him again.</i>

271
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,280
<i>Deok Hee. Is what Hae Young saying true?</i>

272
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,930
<i>Is she really dating that man?</i>

273
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,590
<i>I see you've read it!
Why won't you text back?</i>

274
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,370
- You scared me.
- Bring him where?

275
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,530
You're bringing whom?

276
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,910
- What's wrong with it?
- Don't you know?

277
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,050
People will call you a crazy bitch
for dating that guy.

278
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,570
They'll curse at both of you! How could
you bring him to a family event?

279
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,650
Can't you just be on my side?

280
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,650
Even without you pointing fingers at him,
he's the one who feels the most guilty.

281
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,900
Can't you just tell me it'll all be okay
and pat me on the back?

282
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,030
I want to show him.

283
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,840
That no one in my family blames him
and he shouldn't be discouraged.

284
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,920
Just quietly date him
and break things off.

285
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,250
I'm not just going to date him.

286
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,780
What? Tell her I hate the way she eats?

287
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,490
Hey, you bastard!
How could you say that to a woman?

288
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,320
- Huh?
- Sir.

289
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,990
How could you make me
say that to a woman?

290
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,780
You should have advised me
to tell her the truth!

291
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,320
You said that woman backed off.
So then it was a success!

292
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,630
You come over here.

293
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,930
- Why?
- Come over here.

294
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,110
- You're dead meat.
- How come?

295
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,660
Come over here.

296
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,760
You bastard.

297
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,500
I was the crazy one.

298
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,520
I can't believe
I listened to a guy like you.

299
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,640
What's wrong? Do you feel regretful
now that you've dumped her?

300
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,450
Or does your heart ache like this?

301
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,090
Park Do Kyung.

302
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,020
What should I do with you?

303
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,760
What should I do with you?

304
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,750
Has Hae Young called you?

305
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,890
- To ask you to go to a wedding together?
- No, she hasn't.

306
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,390
Hae Young's cousin is
getting married tomorrow.

307
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,360
She wants to take you with her.

308
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Because she's an idiot, she thinks
dating always leads to marriage.

309
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,570
But that's not quite true
for kids nowadays, right?

310
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,200
They may do some crazy stuff together,
but that's irrelevant to marriage.

311
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,880
Our Hae Young is already thinking
about getting married to you.

312
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,680
But you're testing the waters.

313
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,610
Right?

314
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,070
I like Hae Young.

315
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,370
You've left out some words.

316
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,680
"I'll marry her."

317
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,290
I'm sorry for being old-fashioned.

318
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,140
If she introduces you to
the elders at a family event

319
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,700
it means you two will get married.

320
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,550
If you tell people you two have
broken up after that

321
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,650
it's equivalent to
breaking a marriage off.

322
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,570
That's how the elders will take it.

323
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,300
Even if she asks you to just come to
the wedding and grab a meal...

324
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,090
you can't come to it
with that same mindset.

325
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,290
If you're determined that you'll
marry Hae Young no matter what

326
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,730
then you can come tomorrow.
If not, don't come.

327
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,260
If there is even the slightest thing
stopping you, don't come.

328
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,060
Hae Young's marriage
has been ruined once.

329
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,420
I can't just stand and watch
another one get ruined like that.

330
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,610
What did he say?

331
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,650
He's not the one.

332
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,100
<i>[Hae Young]</i>

333
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,290
- Hey.
<i>- Why did you take so long to answer?</i>

334
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,380
- I was showering.
- You were showering?

335
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,800
Sorry. What are you doing tomorrow?

336
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,110
I'm going to the countryside for work.
I'll be back in the afternoon.

337
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,970
Is that so?

338
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,050
I'm going to my cousin's
wedding tomorrow.

339
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,980
I'll see you at my house tomorrow
evening. I'll cook you something good.

340
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,540
Wow. Seriously? You know how to cook?

341
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,570
I'm good at it.
Don't eat too much at the wedding.

342
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,900
All right. I've got it.

343
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,300
- What do you like to eat?
<i>- Everything.</i>

344
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,530
<i>I don't particularly hate
or love any type of food.</i>

345
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,920
Should we get a drink tomorrow too?

346
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,290
<i>I think it's been forever
since I've had a drink.</i>

347
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,350
I think it's been over 10 days.

348
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,870
I've figured out why
I had been drinking so much.

349
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,620
It was because I wasn't happy.

350
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,560
Nowadays, I feel happy
all the time as if I'm drunk.

351
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,030
- Thank you.
- I'm more grateful.

352
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh my god!

353
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,280
Why aren't you in bed?

354
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,800
Don't worry about tomorrow.

355
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,210
He can't come to the wedding anyway.
He has to work.

356
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,750
Are you looking for me?

357
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,390
Oh my god!

358
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,300
- Are you ready?
- No. I mean...

359
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,840
- Should we kiss?
- It's just that I have... You know...

360
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,530
It's not like that. No. Absolutely not.

361
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,850
Tell me when you're ready.

362
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,980
If you lack the confidence,
then give up.

363
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,700
Get ready for what?

364
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,000
How am I supposed to get ready for it?

365
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,880
This just isn't it from the get-go.

366
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,050
How could we?

367
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,200
Just throw it up high and far.

368
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Here we go. Throw it!

369
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,030
Nice catch.

370
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,470
Is she getting married again?

371
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,500
You see... It's technically not "again."

372
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,580
- She didn't get married that time.
- So she's going to marry that guy again?

373
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,180
Mother, I'll tell you about everything
in detail when we get home.

374
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,120
Is she going to have another wedding?

375
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,640
I will tell you later.

376
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,390
We will do it one more time.

377
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,140
This time, throw it gently.

378
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,950
Ready? Throw it.

379
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,300
It was salty.
All buffets makes me thirsty.

380
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,580
- Here.
- I'm okay.

381
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,930
I haven't seen a very beautiful bride
yet at wedding halls.

382
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,950
I tell them
they're beautiful as a courtesy.

383
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,830
If someone tells me that
I'm pretty at my wedding

384
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,350
I will never be fooled.

385
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,080
Why did you come along?
You should've stayed home.

386
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,140
She's at home, you know.

387
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,620
Don't take too much time.
Make a decision.

388
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,550
Whatever decision you make

389
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,550
my sister or I won't resent you.

390
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,810
Do Kyung, can you
possibly kiss your sister?

391
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,950
- Are you crazy?
- That's how I feel right now.

392
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,330
Now you understand how I feel?

393
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,120
If the idea of kissing is possible,
the answer is right there.

394
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,720
I think I have my answer.

395
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,470
But I still feel that
I need to do something.

396
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,850
Gosh, I really don't know what to do.

397
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,890
What is it? Are you going to
cook for Oh Hae Young Two?

398
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,930
Can't you call her by the right name?

399
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,180
It's just that they have the same name.

400
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,620
In the order of when you met them...

401
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,350
Oh Hae Young One
and Oh Hae Young Two.

402
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,100
I'm sorry.

403
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
I said I'm sorry.

404
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,550
By the way, if you want
to cook for a lady

405
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,260
you should've asked me about it first.

406
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,450
Why would you buy such a thing, huh?

407
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:33,030
You know, I graduated from Stanford
with theadegree in cooking for women.

408
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,640
If a man wants to cook for a woman

409
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,510
it doesn't matter what's on the menu.

410
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,100
You have to choose the menu
that will make you look cool.

411
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,780
For example, you know a pepper grinder.

412
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,310
You know the one you twist, see?

413
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,600
This movement will
fascinate women, okay?

414
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,030
And squeezing a lemon.

415
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,930
When you squeeze
a lemon with one hand

416
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,220
your arm muscles pop out.

417
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,140
Women go crazy for it.

418
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,430
Or when you shake salt...

419
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,660
This is sort of too boring.

420
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,530
You might get criticized
for copying others.

421
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,660
So you'll have to pick food that involves
grinding pepper and squeezing lemons.

422
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,850
So it always comes down to a pasta dish!

423
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,970
Hae Young likes Korean food.

424
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,890
Did you just see me?

425
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,780
How excited I was talking about women?

426
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,890
How poor am I now?

427
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,550
Hey.

428
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,430
My sister likes melon.

429
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,450
Are you trying to mock me?

430
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,450
We have soy sauce at home.

431
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,660
Did you look for me?

432
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,890
Are you ready?

433
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,160
Shall we kiss?

434
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,640
When you're ready, tell me.

435
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,660
Get out of my way!

436
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,890
Wow, the way your dishes look
already passed the test.

437
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,100
Oh no, it doesn't come out right.

438
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,910
- Just eat.
- Hold on.

439
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,490
I don't usually take pictures of dishes.

440
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,970
But it's my first time
having what you cooked.

441
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,060
I will take a photo
and save it as a memory.

442
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,310
Wow, I got it.

443
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Yeah, it came out well.

444
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,680
- Eat.
- Sure.

445
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,280
Let's see.

446
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,100
Wow. Not bad.

447
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,580
You made the broth separately, huh?

448
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,300
Impressive.

449
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,780
Is there anything you can't do?

450
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,870
You can't do cute, can you?

451
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,060
You can't say "How cute!"
squeezing my cheeks, can you?

452
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,410
I will do it later.

453
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,120
Let's hurry up then.

454
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,490
Slow down.

455
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,990
Aren't you going to tell me
that the way I eat is pretty?

456
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,470
Do you like hearing that
after you ask me?

457
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,780
That's pretty.

458
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,950
I'm so happy!

459
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,300
Soo Kyung.

460
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,370
24 hours have passed. Now leave.

461
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,740
Come on, Soo Kyung.

462
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,870
You now know that
we can't even kiss.

463
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,030
But how are we supposed
to live as a married couple?

464
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,700
It's just not going to happen!

465
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,200
Don't take any more time
and just get out of my life.

466
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,890
How am I supposed to
get out of your life?

467
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,140
How is that possible?
There is the baby.

468
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,200
It's okay. Don't feel pressured.

469
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,660
It's not entirely your responsibility.

470
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,490
I will raise the baby on my own.

471
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,390
And until I emigrate

472
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,260
don't come by.

473
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,240
Can you possibly kiss me?

474
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,990
I think I can.

475
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,100
Seriously?

476
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,490
I think I can.

477
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,620
Wait. Wait.

478
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,030
Don't get too aggressive.

479
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,200
Okay... I got it.

480
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,910
Jin Sang.

481
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,860
- Here.
- Okay.

482
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,580
Ta-da!

483
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,750
This is a letter for me
written by a high school boy.

484
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,000
It's so cute.

485
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,100
I found it while going
through my letters today.

486
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,290
He's so cute. Listen to this.

487
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,790
I won't get jealous
of a high school boy, okay?

488
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,170
Just listen to this.

489
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,350
"I saw you walking and sobbing
on your way from school."

490
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,110
"Seeing you sobbing,
my heart also broke down."

491
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,250
"I wanted to comfort you."

492
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,860
"But I couldn't interrupt
while you were crying."

493
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,900
"I just followed behind you."

494
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,150
"If you happened to collapse from crying"

495
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,500
"I wanted to give you a hug."

496
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,790
Who was this guy?

497
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,000
"What happened?"

498
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,960
"What was so bad
that made you sob like that?"

499
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,230
"When you said it was
because Chang Gook Young died"

500
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,690
"I suddenly hated Chang Gook Young
who made you cry."

501
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,520
"I was jealous of him
and wanted to be him."

502
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,690
Tell him that Do Kyung
wants to meet him.

503
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,250
"When I got home,
I ripped up all his pictures."

504
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,850
"I was furious."

505
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,670
Isn't he cute?

506
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,020
Come on, he's so cute.

507
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,880
What is it?

508
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,730
It's a love letter
sent to you in high school.

509
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,500
<i>I knew right away that
this letter was meant for you.</i>

510
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,830
<i>I didn't want to give it to you.</i>

511
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,940
<i>I didn't want to give it to you.</i>

512
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,190
<i>It's okay. Grades aren't everything.</i>

513
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,860
<i>You grew up being loved by your parents. </i>

514
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,020
<i>I didn't want you to
have more love from a boy. </i>

515
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,190
<i>I felt like you were taking
something from me. </i>

516
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,190
<i>I've been throwing away
many letters all these years. </i>

517
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,630
<i>I just couldn't throw away this letter.</i>

518
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,380
<i>Because it wasn't meant for me.</i>

519
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,000
<i>I thought I'd be able to return
this letter to you smiling some day.</i>

520
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,730
<i>When I became good enough
to admit that I was jealous of you</i>

521
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,250
<i>I might be able to
return this letter to you.</i>

522
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,940
<i>That's why I haven't
been able to throw it away. </i>

523
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,150
<i>I'm not good enough yet.</i>

524
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,600
<i>I feel that I need to
return it to you now.</i>

525
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,110
<i>I should return it first
and focus on becoming good. </i>

526
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,480
<i>I am going to try. </i>

527
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
<i>I am going to go for it.</i>

528
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,790
<i>It took 13 years for this letter
to find its way back to you.</i>

529
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

530
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,600
<i>I also feel bad for the boy who wrote it.</i>

531
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,860
<i>I thought I was the one who
kept comparing myself to her. </i>

532
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,900
<i>She says she's kept
comparing herself to me. </i>

533
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,560
<i>Am I happy now that I know
how she's felt all along?</i>

534
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,920
<i>Is it comforting?</i>

535
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,500
<i>Why do I feel sad?</i>

536
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,770
Bitch! Have a good life!

537
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:45,250
<i>Perhaps the boy who threw
a rock at our window back then...</i>

538
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,510
Hey!

539
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,460
<i>I wonder if he had
feelings for me for real.</i>

540
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,380
Yes. Lee Kang Yong?

541
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,250
<i>Correct. Lee Kang Yong. </i>

542
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,900
<i>He might have been
in the class of seven or eight.</i>

543
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,630
- Here he is.
- Can you take a photo and send it?

544
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,440
Okay.

545
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,080
- Let me see.
- No, no need to see it.

546
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,000
- Let me see who the punk is.
- No need to see.

547
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,460
- Give it.
- What are you going to do?

548
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,650
No, no, no.

549
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,210
- Let me see.
- Don't do it. No need to see.

550
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,060
Hold on! Wait!

551
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,190
What's up?

552
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,270
<i>Where are you?</i>

553
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,670
I'm at Hee Ran's.

554
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,110
I will stay over at her place tonight.

555
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,750
I'm serious that I'm at Hee Ran's.

556
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,560
Put her on the phone then.

557
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,210
Put Hee Ran on the phone.

558
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,000
Darn it.

559
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,880
I'm old enough to stay out.

560
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,420
Why are you acting this way?
You told him to take me.

561
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,630
Do you want me to come over right now?

562
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,940
Come home before you get dragged back.

563
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,250
You think it's good
as long as I come home at night, huh?

564
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,540
I can't do whatever just because
I have to come home early?

565
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,540
I can do whatever during the day too.

566
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,980
Can't you keep
your love life more private?

567
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,150
Why did you let
everybody know it all, huh?

568
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,170
You have no pride, girl.

569
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,580
If I ever catch you cooking for him
and going in and out of his place

570
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,600
- I will kill you.
- He cooked for me tonight.

571
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,460
Why did he have to cook for you?

572
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,880
Why would he cook for you
when you two are going to break up soon?

573
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,100
We have no food in our house?

574
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,290
How do you know that
we're going to break up soon?

575
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,310
Excuse me. Don't do this.

576
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,420
Come on.

577
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,880
I told him this.

578
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,080
If he ever wants to marry you

579
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,610
come to Suh Hee's wedding
and if not, don't show up.

580
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,750
That bastard didn't show up!

581
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,610
I'm sure he had his reasons.

582
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,730
Now all our family knows about you.

583
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,440
Not anymore.

584
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,330
Know that.

585
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,900
If you still want to see him,
see him secretly.

586
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,710
Why did you have to say that to him?

587
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,540
Why did you pressure him?

588
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,000
I don't have to get married.

589
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,900
If you weren't going to marry, why bother
planning to bring him to the party?

590
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,480
Because I thought it wouldn't
make you look as bad at the wedding.

591
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,520
I knew that everyone
would be talking about me

592
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,000
so I planned on it so you both
wouldn't feel so ashamed.

593
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,710
If he had come

594
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,310
you wouldn't have had
to feel so ashamed!

595
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,500
Hello?

596
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,210
What's wrong?

597
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,110
I cried.

598
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,130
How come?

599
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,770
My mom hit me.

600
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,290
Because I lied that
I was at Hee Ran's.

601
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,520
I'm too old to get beaten up by her.

602
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,420
Don't cry.

603
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Don't cry.

604
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,540
My mom is giving me
a dirty look now to hang up.

605
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,630
I will call you later.

606
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,960
When I'm about to die

607
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,650
if I think back on this moment

608
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,500
this will mean nothing.

609
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,460
This means nothing.

610
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,290
Let's go for it.

611
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,580
Soo Kyung, are you okay?

612
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,190
That's enough. Stop now.

613
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,650
Soo Kyung.

614
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,730
I'm sorry.

615
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,880
I've kissed so many women before.

616
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:42,060
- Honestly, with you...
- I understand.

617
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,880
Go.

618
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,670
Good try.

619
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:52,000
How can I possibly get out of your life
when you're carrying my child?

620
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,650
See what happens if you dance!

621
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,330
- Can I have one pitcher of beer here?
- Sure.

622
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,750
Gosh.

623
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,130
I had no idea about this chicken place.

624
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,190
Why beer and chicken during the day?

625
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,610
You seemed so happy that
you were on top of the world.

626
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,480
Now what happened?

627
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,730
Why do I always lower myself
when I'm in a relationship?

628
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:10,040
I was going to go for it
until I get rejected completely.

629
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,000
I didn't care if I loved him
more than he did.

630
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,900
- Now I feel differently.
- Are you still talking about that?

631
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,690
Honestly...

632
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,440
I don't understand why you think
Park Do Kyung will marry you.

633
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,290
Don't you have to take time
and see if he's the right one for you?

634
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,460
Love comes at once
when it happens.

635
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,230
It doesn't let me take
my time and think about it.

636
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,210
I want to hold his hands,
sleep with him, and marry him.

637
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,830
For me, it doesn't
always go in that order.

638
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,190
When I fall in love

639
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,210
in my head, I'm already sleeping
with him and being married to him.

640
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,980
- Is it just me?
- Yes.

641
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,290
- It's just you who thinks that way.
- I see.

642
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,830
<i>[The Man Next Door]</i>

643
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,630
- Why aren't you answering?
- I want to play hard to get.

644
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,460
<i>Your call is being redirected...</i>

645
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,130
<i>[Provisional Seizure Notice]</i>

646
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,980
<i>[Decision]</i>

647
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,710
By any chance...

648
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,190
Don't worry about this.

649
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,830
Is it a private loan?

650
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,900
He and I have
made deals many times before.

651
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,480
He's just doing this for no reason.

652
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,310
He's never said anything
when I was late with my payment.

653
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,060
He will lift the seizure notice soon.

654
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,100
Don't worry about it.

655
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,940
Don't think about getting
money elsewhere to stop that.

656
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,670
Just leave it.

657
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,290
Don't worry. I will handle it, okay?

658
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,940
I'm saying don't worry. Just leave it.

659
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:04,110
When I was little,
I'd kick a can on my way home.

660
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,580
I got so attached to that can
that I couldn't leave it outside.

661
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,710
I'm a can.

662
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,880
I told myself "I'm a mere can"
and went inside.

663
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,790
But I came out and took it inside.

664
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:21,130
That's cute.

665
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,650
Why didn't you answer my calls?

666
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,270
- Because I'm mad.
- Why?

667
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,830
I thought we both liked each other.

668
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,400
But it seems that I'm the only
one who feels that way.

669
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,940
If you like me
89 on the scale, not 100

670
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,360
then tell me so.
I will like you for the same amount.

671
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,250
I feel it's only 89 on the scale
when I thought it was 100.

672
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,170
Every time that happens...

673
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,310
I don't feel good.

674
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,230
So tell me so I can match that level.

675
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,920
It's 100 on the scale.

676
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,400
The 100 you're referring to
and mine seem different.

677
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,270
Mine is seriously 100 on the scale.

678
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,190
Because you're mad, you're
starting to call me "mister," huh?

679
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,520
- Go.
- Let's say bye after I give you a hug.

680
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,730
If I leave without one,
I'll be down.

681
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,880
I may get angry too.

682
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,190
Go now.

683
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,400
I will let you take away everything.

684
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,440
I will go down completely.

685
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,060
I will give you my arm if you ask.

686
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,440
I will give you my leg if you ask.

687
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,270
Just let me live.

688
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,540
Come inside. You will get
recorded by the CCTV there.

689
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,670
One sunny day...

690
00:59:55,690 --> 01:00:00,730
I am walking in my favorite suit.

691
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:06,790
This guy suddenly kicks my knee.

692
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,400
So I ask him why.

693
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,790
Do you know what that punk tells me?

694
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,500
He says it was a mistake.

695
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,080
After he put me through so much

696
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,790
he says it was a mistake.

697
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,690
But that's not the end of the story.

698
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:31,170
It turns out that now
he's wearing my favorite suit.

699
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,560
He kicks my knee by accident.

700
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,690
And he steals my suit too.

701
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,020
What would you do
if you were me?

702
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,040
Spare my life.

703
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,760
<i>[The Man Next Door]</i>

704
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,690
I'm sorry.

705
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,880
I can't sleep.

706
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,770
I'm angry.

707
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,380
I miss you.

708
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,400
<i>Come over.</i>

709
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,270
Come over even if
you're 89 on the scale.

710
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,880
Come over.

711
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,190
I can't come.

712
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,560
Were you 70 on the scale?

713
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,500
<i>Right before I was dying...</i>

714
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,690
<i>I was regretting that I didn't
love her with all my heart. </i>

715
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,150
<i>That's why I made another decision.</i>

716
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,250
<i>So here I am.</i>

717
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,400
<i>If I die this time</i>

718
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,960
<i>I will probably regret this moment.</i>

719
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,880
<i>When I'm not being honest.</i>

720
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,630
<i>When I couldn't be honest. </i>

721
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,710
<i>When I made her misunderstand.</i>

722
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,380
<i>When I hurt her feelings.</i>

723
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:43,690
<i>The same way Han Tae Jin couldn't
be honest and hurt her feelings...</i>

724
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:49,130
<i>Am I making the same mistake right now?</i>

725
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:54,210
<i>Should I tell her the truth right now?</i>

726
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,170
<i>I might die soon.</i>

727
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,560
<i>If I tell her the truth</i>

728
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,150
<i>would we still be
as happy as we are now?</i>

729
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,500
<i>If she knows that I may die soon</i>

730
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:20,730
<i>will she still be able
to smile at me like now?</i>

731
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,100
Who did this to you?

732
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:39,110
Who did this to you?

733
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,420
Didn't you expect that
I'd get beaten up this much?

734
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,900
I expected this.

735
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,730
Compared to what I did to him...

736
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,290
I have to endure everything

737
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,270
including my business failure
and getting beaten up.

738
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,520
It's okay.

739
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,210
Don't you dare go see him.

740
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,020
I'm sorry that I didn't
come to the wedding.

741
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,330
I had my reasons.

742
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,770
Until I die

743
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,150
I won't leave you.

744
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,860
I'm 100 on the scale, not 89.

745
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,210
<i>I wish Tae Jin's wounded heart
could be healed.</i>

746
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:23,980
<i>I wish we all could
have peace of mind.</i>

747
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,460
<i>I wish no one would be left
with an aching heart. </i>

748
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:36,850
<i>Not Tae Jin, me, or him...</i>

749
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:51,310
<i>I still want to see her smile. </i>

750
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,500
<i>I want her to be happier. </i>

751
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,560
<i>I still do.</i>

752
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,790
<i>[Many thanks to Woo Hyun,
Seo Joon Young, and Seo Ye Ji.]</i>

<i>Just tell her everything.</i>

755
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,380
<i>Han Tae Jin is pissed
and he will try to kill me.</i>

756
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,690
<i>What should you do?</i>

757
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:18,290
<i>The recording studio will be
repossessed in one or two days.</i>

758
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:22,080
<i>Han Tae Jin is playing badly,
unlike his build.</i>

759
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,750
<i>Am I allowed to have my heart flutter?</i>

760
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,540
<i>Now you should go home.</i>

761
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,230
<i>I may go somewhere
to have an exorcism done.</i>

762
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:33,560
<i>Why are so many Oh Hae Youngs
entangled in our lives?</i>

763
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,730
<i>Just relax and go with it.</i>

764
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,560
<i>I'm also curious about
how your life will end.</i>
