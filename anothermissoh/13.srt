<i>[Another Oh Hae Young]</i>

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,534
I don't care if I die.

4
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:27,198
But I won't die with regret.

5
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:31,245
I will never die with regret.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,006
I will go all the way...

7
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,714
to where my heart takes me.

<i>[The Woman Next Door]</i>

00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,961

<i>[Episode 13: The Heart I've Understood]</i>

11
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:37,183
- Hello. How have you been?
- Welcome.

12
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,624
- Hae Young wasn't picking up her phone.
- I see. She's in her room. Come in.

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,865
Let's go.

14
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:52,437
It's as if you knew I was coming.
You were all ready and everything.

15
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,011
You should dress nicely too
before you go out.

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,131
- We'll be back.
- All right.

17
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,927
Go somewhere far. Like the beach.

18
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:05,032
We might not even come back.

19
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:18,878
If you don't want to talk,
you don't have to say a word.

20
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:22,140
I can play some background
music for you, right?

21
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,375
<i>I know that my tears
will be difficult for you to see.</i>

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,544
<i>All I can do...</i>

24
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:37,075
What perfect timing.

25
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:41,026
These lyrics must
represent how you feel.

26
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:49,900
<i>The me who was in love with you
and lost half of his mind</i>

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,200
<i>the me who dreamed of you</i>

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,300
<i>must have longed for you
to look back at me once.</i>

29
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,546
<i>There are times in my memory</i>

30
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:11,516
<i>I hope that there are days
when you'd hear news about me.</i>

31
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:17,777
<i>That you would notice my heart
tiptoeing around you</i>

32
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:26,374
<i>and that these hopes
and this foolish love would hurt you.</i>

33
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,331
Once I was in my thirties

34
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,958
I thought I would be
living a wonderful life.

35
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,196
I thought I would be living in a studio
and driving my own car.

36
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,914
Traveling abroad once or twice a year.

37
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:42,571
I don't know why I thought
I'd be living that life in my thirties.

38
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:44,972
You probably thought
you would make a lot of money.

39
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:47,400
Maybe you thought
you would easily earn money.

40
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,035
I thought I would have
a fabulous love life too.

41
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:55,433
Yet I still stumble over
love like an idiot.

42
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,456
But I'm...

43
00:03:57,456 --> 00:04:01,565
jealous of you,
someone who stumbles over love.

44
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:04,630
Because I've never done such a thing.

45
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:10,171
So you've decided to
end things with him?

46
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,931
Yes.

47
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,512
I got dumped.

48
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,801
I don't think you were
necessarily dumped.

49
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,548
It would have been hard to
work it out with him anyway.

50
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:27,337
Park Do Kyung has nicely
ended things for you.

51
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:30,145
He just wants to be the bad guy

52
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,178
and won't make you be the bad woman.

53
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:34,955
Hey.

54
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,770
That just means
he doesn't love me as much.

55
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,974
Hey.

56
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:43,715
It's not because he doesn't love you.

57
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46,984
It's because he doesn't
know how to love.

58
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,500
Men just don't know
what's more hurtful for women.

59
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,200
Look at Tae Jin too.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,541
Because he thought you'd wait for him

61
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:02,476
he dumped you, saying
those absurd things not to burden you.

62
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,685
Men just don't know whether
it's more hurtful for a woman

63
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,974
to wait for a guy who has gone bankrupt

64
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,803
or live for the rest of
her life all hurt and scarred

65
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:15,224
after hearing those painful words
from the man she loves.

66
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:19,366
For women, they're always
ready to take things all the way.

67
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,085
Right?

68
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,962
When will I finally get
to dump someone first?

69
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,429
Let's do it this time.

70
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:30,162
Dump whomever
you end up dating this time.

71
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,895
Should I?

72
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:36,195
Okay. I'll dump whomever
I end up dating this time.

73
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,604
If you won't, I'm going to follow you
around and tell you to dump him.

74
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:43,090
"This is your one and only
opportunity in life!"

75
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,996
"Dump him. Quickly! Dump him!"

76
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:49,287
- Should I just go around dumping people?
- Sure! Do it.

77
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,952
Oh my! Oh no! My hat.

78
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,936
- It's an expensive hat.
- Fine. I've got it.

79
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,058
Hae Young! Oh no!

80
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,423
Oh no!

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,512
If you got wet, you should've bought
new clothes, including underwear.

82
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:41,638
They don't cost that much.
Why walk around in wet clothes all day?

83
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:44,371
It hasn't been too long
since you got doused with water.

84
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:50,385
This is nice.

85
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,104
Your dad and I are moving.

86
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,700
Come with us.

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,214
You wanted to move to
the countryside, didn't you?

88
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,895
Let's move to Chung Joo
and live with Grandma.

89
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:02,471
I'm going back to work tomorrow.

90
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:05,991
No need to persist stubbornly.
Just resign.

91
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,500
After you resign,
come to Chung Joo with us.

92
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,335
It's more embarrassing to run away.

93
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,678
I just want to get back up. Right here.

94
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,782
Your daughter is strong. I won't get
knocked down by something like this.

95
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:23,823
I'm the woman who got dumped the day
before her wedding and survived it.

96
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,164
Stop. Don't say those things.

97
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:26,960
You can even search for me online.

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,250
If you type "Oh Hae Young Clip,"
you'll find me.

99
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,871
What an honor to our family.

100
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,000
Who is it?

101
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:02,460
I'll tell Hae Young to call you.

102
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,508
So you should go.
Hurry and go!

103
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,493
Run!

104
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,749
Whose hand are you holding?

105
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:07,174
- Don't take your clothes off.
- I won't.

106
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:09,841
I only do that with
people I have affection for.

107
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,610
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:17,275
I thought people's eyes don't lie.

109
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,736
But I guess I got fooled by your eyes.

110
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:22,323
I guess you can't judge
a person by their face.

111
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,675
A daughter who chased after

112
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,987
the guy who has ruined her life
without knowing anything.

113
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:31,909
A mother who fed that guy.

114
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:35,034
Both the daughter
and her mother are idiots.

115
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,593
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:46,644
I stayed quiet even though
I know where you live.

117
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,233
There is no use in cursing at
a person who is to be

118
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,634
completely cut out of your life.

119
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,393
That's why I didn't pay you a visit.

120
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:56,648
But I think I need to tell you this.

121
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:58,799
Nothing is free in life.

122
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:03,294
If you make someone miserable,
something even worse will come your way.

123
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:07,418
For ruining a perfectly fine couple
with a bright future.

124
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:12,042
For breaking
my precious daughter's heart.

125
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:16,337
You'll be punished for your wrongdoings.

126
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:18,696
Of course you should be.

127
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:21,367
My daughter has been
through hell because of you.

128
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,284
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,726
Hey.

130
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,389
- He's here.
- Huh?

131
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,793
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,914
What's the use in wishing
bad things for someone?

133
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,252
I would like to cancel
what I've just said.

134
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,809
I'll just punch him once and end it all.

135
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:54,651
Get back in.

136
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:58,838
From now on, you should keep your
eyes down when you meet someone.

137
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,390
Those big sad eyes of yours.

138
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,957
- I was going to curse at you...
- Go back in.

139
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:09,398
Let's go home.
Why do you keep blaming his eyes?

140
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,694
Let's hurry and get back in.

141
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:13,485
Let's go. Come on.

142
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:36,419
- Why are you here?
- Because I've missed you.

143
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,909
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,625
For being too late.

145
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:44,555
My goodness.

146
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:47,938
Just makes me wonder
what kind of man you are.

147
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:52,095
You didn't even budge when
I begged you in my worst possible state.

148
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:55,203
Now that you feel a little better,
here you are again.

149
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,548
- I'm sorry.
- We really weren't meant to be.

150
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:03,087
Our timing is just completely off.

151
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:08,405
It's all over now,
so don't come here anymore.

152
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:10,616
I've received the security deposit

153
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:13,178
and I won't say anything to
the owner of the house.

154
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:17,601
So you just need to pay rent on time.
Don't make him call me.

155
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:19,514
I've made mistakes.

156
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:21,299
I was wrong.

157
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,900
I won't ever act like a loser
in front of you.

158
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,774
I won't ever again go back and forth.

159
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:32,391
No matter what happens

160
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:34,643
I won't ever let you go.

161
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:40,461
I won't ever go back and forth either.

162
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,283
I've decided to let you go.

163
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,457
I've let you go already.

164
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,823
- I know you're mad at me.
- Do I seem like I'm playing hard to get?

165
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:56,278
When I like someone,
I don't play these games.

166
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,507
Or maybe you think I'm so easy that
I'll fall for you whenever you chase me.

167
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:02,199
You know that's not what I meant.

168
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:09,401
You know that I've unwillingly pushed
you away even though I like you too.

169
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,611
No need for you to do
such a thing anymore.

170
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:14,217
I won't ever go back to you.

171
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:16,995
If we ever see each other
on the street by coincidence

172
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,629
let's not greet each other.
Let's just go our own ways.

173
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:24,212
Instead of acting all cool and happy.
I'm not good at these things.

174
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,097
This isn't a tear. I have a runny nose.

175
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:37,293
It's not that I'm sad.
I just have a cold.

176
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,121
Don't take this the wrong way.

177
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm grateful.

178
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,212
For letting me end things
by dumping you.

179
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:37,905
I just don't need a lamp anymore.

180
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,069
Let's go and beg him. Okay?

181
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:19,121
CEO Jang will do anything.

182
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:21,616
Let's go and ask for forgiveness.

183
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,510
Do Kyung...

184
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,776
Let's just beg him once.

185
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,100
Do Kyung.

186
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:36,342
<i>It's all going the way...</i>

187
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:38,973
It's taken us longer, but...

188
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,411
somehow we've ended up
back together with the right people.

189
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:44,792
<i>The way I've seen it.</i>

190
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,381
Like you've said

191
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,544
all the visions I've been seeing are

192
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:55,015
from the reminiscences before my death.

193
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:57,180
The regretful moments.

194
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:03,932
Visions that can't be changed
and are useless to see.

195
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,781
I wonder why I'm seeing them.

196
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:11,328
"We're just looking back on our lives..."

197
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:15,015
"that have ended already."

198
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:19,726
Whenever I feel like I'm wasting
my energy on something useless

199
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:22,026
this is the phrase I read to myself.

200
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,502
"We're just looking back on our lives"

201
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:28,299
"that have ended already."

202
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:31,481
What if our lives have already come to
an end based on a completed scenario

203
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:33,893
and this moment we know as present is

204
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,222
just the reminiscences of our souls?

205
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,983
You would feel futile, right?
And just live however?

206
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,857
But it's quite the opposite.

207
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,699
If you genuinely accept it,
you feel at ease.

208
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,823
You quietly start
looking into your heart.

209
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:56,111
In this situation

210
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:59,226
what is it that my heart wants the most?

211
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:06,507
Life is a scenario about your heart.

212
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,876
Don't try too hard to
change the situation.

213
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:12,727
From one moment to another,
just quietly...

214
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,641
relax and look into your heart.

215
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:18,419
To see what your heart wants to do.

216
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,699
<i>I've never revealed my heart with ease.</i>

217
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,199
<i>To not get hurt</i>

218
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,100
<i>I've always done the bare minimum.</i>

219
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,843
<i>Less than the other person's kindness.</i>

220
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:38,195
<i>More than the other person's hostility.</i>

221
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:41,528
<i>My standards were always set
based on the other person's reactions.</i>

222
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,798
I've never unraveled my heart's desire.
Not even once.

223
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,838
Once you acknowledge that
things are transient

224
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,486
you don't waste your energy
on useless things.

225
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:54,745
I'm now not afraid of dying at all.

226
00:17:56,948 --> 00:18:00,386
<i>I didn't give more love to
the person I could have.</i>

227
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:04,400
<i>I could've given her as much love
as I wanted, but I didn't.</i>

228
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:07,784
<i>The fact that there is this woman
who is suffering</i>

229
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:10,141
<i>because of my cautiousness...</i>

230
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:14,368
<i>That's what bothers me the most.</i>

231
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:22,507
Hello. Hi.

232
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,409
Hey there.

233
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:27,508
Hello.

234
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,891
Hello!

235
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,676
Long time no see, eh?

236
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,168
- Aren't you guys getting on?
- We are. Sure. Yes.

237
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,689
I wanted to take more time off

238
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:48,590
but I've used up all of
my vacation days for the year.

239
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,684
My face looks
completely different, right?

240
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:53,629
I've lost two kilograms.
My waistline got slimmer too.

241
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,600
I should cause trouble one more time
to lose two more kilograms!

242
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,911
I'm fine! Truly. I'm fine.

243
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:08,278
So talk with ease.

244
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:11,505
- You're really okay, right?
- Yes!

245
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:13,878
She seems okay.

246
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,130
What's with the flowers?

247
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,631
I bought them. I thought it
might make me look less pitiful.

248
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,015
I'm really okay. Please laugh with ease!

249
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:30,446
Of course!
She's our Assistant Manager Oh!

250
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:36,928
I didn't know.
That my brother was involved in it.

251
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,561
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:45,900
Everyone is telling me,
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

253
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,031
This is my first time hearing
that phrase so often.

254
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,745
But it doesn't feel so great.

255
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,916
It feels like I've become a loser.

256
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:58,642
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,660
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:04,504
Never mind. Forget it. I'm not sorry.

259
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:09,055
Do Kyung is in a lot of pain.

260
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:12,835
Tell him not to be. It's all over now.

261
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:17,727
I guess I shouldn't even
tell him what to do.

262
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:21,389
It doesn't matter. I'm fine.

263
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:23,940
From now on, I'm going to live like you.

264
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,131
"I don't need a man.
Who cares about love?"

265
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:29,397
I'm going to live that kind of life.

266
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:33,600
As a cool, chic, and independent person.

267
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,574
But something must have happened
while I was taking some time off.

268
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:43,226
This is my first time seeing
you wear shoes without heels.

269
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:47,066
You see...
My feet were getting swollen...

270
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:50,880
You've put a mole on your face too.

271
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,739
What do you mean?

272
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,449
- A mole?
- Over here...

273
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:02,559
It's from some kind of snack.

274
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,938
You used to never eat
these kind of things.

275
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,950
My blood sugar level is a little low.

276
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,136
I'm sorry.

277
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,016
It's okay.

278
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:23,857
Now that everything was publicly
announced, I actually feel at ease.

279
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,005
It feels like I'm traveling
cross-country naked.

280
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,758
I have nothing left to hide
or be cautious about.

281
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,823
I'm just...

282
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,320
a woman worth this much.

283
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,786
I thought about resigning...

284
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:51,113
but if I quit now, I feel like
I could never make a comeback.

285
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:56,661
You're the pretty Oh Hae Young.

286
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,655
I'm the ordinary Oh Hae Young.

287
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:02,572
I felt like it would
stay that way forever.

288
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:08,081
While I was getting compared to you
during my teens

289
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:13,082
I think I just had this perception
that I was a sore loser.

290
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:17,006
That's how I feel right now too.
Whether it's through work or whatever.

291
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,631
By your side

292
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,499
looking at you...

293
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:28,652
I would like to overcome it.

294
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:30,919
You're still the same.

295
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,740
You always get over things so easily
and get back on your feet.

296
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,684
- I do?
- You used to when we were in school too.

297
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:39,723
You were sobbing your heart out
like a baby in one moment

298
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:42,673
and then in another moment,
you'd be smiling as if nothing was wrong.

299
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,829
You just made me feel awkward
for worrying about you.

300
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:49,763
You really won't get a drink with me?

301
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,253
Let's get a drink some other day.

302
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:59,492
When? When will you drink with me?

303
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,570
Some day.

304
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,344
I'll get going.

305
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,487
Park Do Kyung and I are completely over.

306
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,717
Good luck with him.

307
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,704
Okay. I'm done cleaning up.

308
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,040
<i>Do Kyung and Hae Young.</i>

309
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,614
<i>They didn't break up
because they got sick of each other.</i>

310
00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:25,633
<i>Or because they didn't like each other.</i>

311
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>They painfully broke up even though
they still love each other.</i>

312
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,499
<i>That's what makes me sadder.</i>

313
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,030
<i>I'm not even Do Kyung's
most painful love anymore.</i>

314
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,092
<i>If we can't be in love again</i>

315
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,783
<i>I wanted to at least remain
Do Kyung's most painful love.</i>

316
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,054
You're all done.

317
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:04,955
- I'm done.
- Keep going.

318
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,737
Your ears are all clean now.

319
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:25,792
Hello?

320
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,932
Yes. Yes, Producer Kim.

321
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:34,390
No. It's all right. I'm home right now.

322
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,417
Right now? Sure. Yes. That's fine.

323
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,190
Yes! Sure. I'll go right now.

324
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,987
- Sure.
- Who is it?

325
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:49,207
- Producer Kim.
- Is something wrong with your recording?

326
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:52,261
No. No.
She wants to work on my scenario.

327
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:55,040
Something is up.
If she approves, it'll be legitimate!

328
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,139
My god!

329
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,292
Have some of this before you go!

330
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,544
I just finished making
kimchi fried rice.

331
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:14,110
I've read it over again.

332
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,942
Your characters are nice.

333
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:21,673
Let's adjust them a little
and send your scenario to actors.

334
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:25,417
Once we find some good actors,
people will naturally invest in it.

335
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,019
Let's see. Firstly...

336
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,998
I should give this to Jung Min.

337
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:34,545
Never mind. Maybe a good-looking
actor will suit the role better.

338
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:38,920
A handsome man, playing a loser role.

339
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:43,207
That's it. That would work better.

340
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:46,078
I should show this to Jung Jae first.

341
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,140
By the way.
I've thought long and hard about it.

342
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,564
But doesn't this part
just seem a little off?

343
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:58,609
There is just something missing
in this action scene.

344
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:01,838
These scenes need to be good in order
for the actors to love the script.

345
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:05,528
Sure. As I was writing it, I thought
that part was a little lacking too.

346
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:09,370
- I guess it just wasn't working out.
- Yeah.

347
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,740
I will try to make it work this time.

348
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,478
Just give me one day...
Maybe two. Or three days?

349
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:17,640
Never mind. No. No. No.

350
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,552
I'll make it better in two days.

351
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:38,328
- She's not drunk. What's with her?
- I know. Right?

352
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,986
Excuse me.

353
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:01,764
Could you take me home?

354
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,690
I...

355
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,142
am pregnant.

356
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:11,422
Please take me home.

357
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,882
What to do...

358
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:19,082
So with that man?

359
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,034
He doesn't know he is the baby's dad.

360
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,428
He thinks it's someone else's baby.

361
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,668
Are you going to have this baby?

362
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,736
Didn't you say he has a lot of issues?

363
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:38,896
You said he jumps from
one woman to another...

364
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,800
That's not the only problem.

365
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,646
A rapist. A serial killer.

366
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:47,553
He's the infamous low-class attorney

367
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:51,199
who defends whomever will
pay him a lot of money.

368
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:54,586
He has no conscience at all.

369
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:57,456
That bastard who shamelessly
claims their innocence!

370
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:12,348
My baby is probably okay, right?

371
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:20,350
Objectively...

372
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:24,223
He's a piece of trash. Complete garbage.

373
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,070
But subjectively...

374
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:34,071
I like him.

375
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,676
Because I've slept with him.

376
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,278
Then you should ask him.

377
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:42,961
Who knows?
Maybe he'll want to get married.

378
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:46,823
Never. Not in a million years.

379
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:51,199
He'll probably pass out

380
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:54,786
not only when he finds out
I'm pregnant with his baby

381
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,882
but even when he hears
that we've slept together.

382
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:02,999
I've known him since
he was a 14-year-old kid.

383
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:06,571
He used to walk around naked
in front of me.

384
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:11,342
If he finds out

385
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,488
we slept together...

386
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,499
<i>[Jin Sang]</i>

387
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:32,851
Soo Kyung, I've just asked six men.

388
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:35,948
If a woman gets pregnant after
a one-night stand and comes to them

389
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:40,833
they all would never marry her.
They'd tell her to not have the baby.

390
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,253
Me?

391
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:45,388
I would immediately flee the country.

392
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:48,076
<i>Who cares if she has the kid or not?
I would run. No matter what.</i>

393
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:50,788
I would go to the countryside in England

394
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:53,014
change my name to William Sutherland,
and live there.

395
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Yeah?

396
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:59,615
Okay. I've got it. Hold on.

397
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,306
Hey, listen up. Listen.

398
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:06,437
She would like to have the baby.

399
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:08,531
She's 44 years old. 44.

400
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:12,316
This may be the last pregnancy of
her life. Of course she would want to.

401
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:16,130
But the problem is, should she bear
this baby after she tells the father?

402
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,607
Or should she just have the baby
and quietly raise it by herself?

403
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:20,893
So here comes the question.

404
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:24,903
Would it be better for you to live life
without knowing of your kid's existence?

405
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:27,925
Or would you rather know?

406
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:30,938
Raise your hand if
you would rather not know.

407
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,050
I see. Two people.

408
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,156
Raise your hand if
you think you'd rather know.

409
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:43,968
Soo Kyung. It's two to four.

410
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,815
They'd rather know.

411
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,234
<i>I feel the same way about this too.
Of course he should know.</i>

412
00:31:48,234 --> 00:31:51,997
Living life without the knowledge
of my own kid's existence is...

413
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,608
<i>That's a little...</i>

414
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:55,888
How should I put it?

415
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,144
It's as if there is a bomb
somewhere in the house

416
00:31:58,144 --> 00:31:59,930
but I'm the only one
who doesn't know about it.

417
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,953
Make sure you tell him! Okay?

418
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:07,009
I think it's right to tell the truth.

419
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,739
When you want to raise
the baby by yourself

420
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:10,179
what would he have to say to that?

421
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,300
<i>Tell him right away.</i>

422
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,400
Call him up and tell him now.

423
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:16,780
I understand, so don't worry.

424
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,650
I will tell him.

425
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,489
I will... definitely tell him.

426
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,880
That's right. Tell him.

427
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,100
Shall we get something good to eat?

428
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:06,219
There you are. You came.

429
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:11,769
Why did you two tenants
make a deal about my house, huh?

430
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,169
Who do you think you are?

431
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,780
Why did you act
like the owner of this house?

432
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,439
You kicked her out by paying
her security deposit?

433
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:20,580
You desperately wanted
to get her out of here.

434
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,130
So you ended up kicking her out?

435
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,130
How cruel.

436
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,699
I happened to come by here
and saw it empty.

437
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:30,380
If I hadn't seen it

438
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,150
you would've made it look
like she was living here, huh?

439
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,969
How sneaky you are!

440
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:39,600
Didn't I tell you that
I wouldn't give it to you?

441
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:42,130
Miss, please listen carefully.

442
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,509
According to the contract, I will
return your security deposit in one year.

443
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:48,189
Until then, you need to pay the rent.

444
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,959
If not, I will start to take it
out of your security deposit.

445
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,150
He will send you the rent on time.

446
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,880
Did I rent this place to this punk?

447
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,119
I rented it to you.

448
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,119
I got the security deposit
from him, so I'm all good.

449
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:02,829
Why did you get
your security deposit from him?

450
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm the owner of this house.

451
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,950
If that's how you're
going to handle this

452
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,979
why did you sign the contract?

453
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:10,820
Plus, your deal isn't valid.

454
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,599
I will see you in one year.

455
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,599
You can't use this place. Got that?

456
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,610
I don't want to come back
to this place in one year.

457
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,150
I want to end things right now.

458
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,539
I will give you
whatever amount you ask for.

459
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:32,570
What's the point of trying
to stop her from moving out?

460
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,869
Can you... just move back?

461
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,579
I'd like it if you moved back in.

462
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,919
- I will give you a ride.
- No thanks.

463
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,979
Hi, Tae Jin. I'm on my way.

464
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,999
<i>[Han Tae Jin]</i>

465
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,079
What's wrong?

466
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,289
I have a cold.

467
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:29,249
- Did you take some medicine?
- Yes.

468
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:32,910
Sorry I was wrong about you two.

469
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,889
I thought you
were seeing each other.

470
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:38,599
I thought he did that
to take you away from me.

471
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,410
I'm sorry.

472
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,700
Try. It's delicious.

473
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,590
I was planning to get my revenge on him.

474
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,910
It turns out that it was a waste of time.

475
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,400
- I can't believe it was a mistake...
- Can we not talk about him?

476
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
I don't want to hear about him.

477
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,010
I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling well.

478
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,709
Have some.

479
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,130
I have a runny nose
because of the cold.

480
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,240
Let's break up.

481
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:30,030
I think it's the right thing to break up.

482
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,950
Let's... just hang out.

483
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,950
There is no need to cut me out.

484
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,240
We will give it more time and...

485
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,530
if it still doesn't feel right,
let's break up then.

486
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,700
It's because I'm sorry.

487
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,229
I'm home.

488
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,800
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes, I did.

489
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,550
- Did you take your medicine?
- I did.

490
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,550
You don't look so good though.

491
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,280
What is it? Your fever hasn't gone down?

492
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,610
- It's better than yesterday though.
- You sound hoarser than yesterday.

493
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,340
Don't I sound sexy then?

494
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,709
Crazy girl.

495
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,869
Are you advertising that you live alone?

496
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:08,030
That punk had the change.

497
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,220
Didn't you say those were
too small and hurt your feet?

498
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,050
They seem to have stretched
out a bit. They're okay.

499
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:25,709
I will see you when I get home.

500
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,300
Boss, you have a guest.

501
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,639
Wow, your office looks good, huh?

502
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,019
Shouldn't you come by
to see me first though?

503
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,309
CEO Park Do Kyung.

504
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:43,660
Gosh, I was also a CEO once.

505
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,950
But that all flew out the window
thanks to a certain someone.

506
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:51,709
You better watch out.
You could be out of a job in an instant.

507
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,900
If someone makes up his mind...

508
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
I won't hide from it.

509
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,019
Do whatever you like.

510
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,740
You said this when you
ran into my car, didn't you?

511
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:08,349
It was a mistake that
you ruined my company.

512
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,680
It was a mistake that I made
your company bankrupt back then.

513
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,229
But I meant to do this.

514
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:17,559
You meant to run into my car.

515
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,570
You were already falling for
her then, weren't you?

516
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:31,200
You were mad that the woman
you like was hurting so much...

517
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
over what I said, weren't you?

518
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:39,639
Then you should've stopped right there.

519
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:42,669
Why didn't you stop right there?
Why drag it out until now?

520
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:46,090
Now everybody knows the truth.
What are you going to do?

521
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:49,680
There is no other way.

522
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,880
We will all have to go back
to our rightful places.

523
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,160
That has to happen.

524
00:41:56,959 --> 00:42:00,079
If the public finds that
you stole my girlfriend

525
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,599
I wouldn't be able to survive
in this country anymore.

526
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,090
Depending on what you do

527
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,729
I could ruin you or let you slide.

528
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,220
So...

529
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,950
let's all go back to where we were.

530
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:25,510
You had a girlfriend
you liked, didn't you?

531
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:28,800
This whole thing happened
because of her, right?

532
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,039
I will assume that
you will do what I say.

533
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:33,930
Bye for now.

534
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,070
It's taken us longer, but...

535
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,490
somehow we've ended up
back together with the right people.

Wow, this office worked on that film too?

538
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,689
He's worked on many famous films then.

539
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,820
I don't like to work.

540
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,470
- Bye.
- Bye.

- Who is he?
- I don't know.

542
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:21,559
Wow, he has charisma, doesn't he?

543
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:44,169
It didn't work, did it?

544
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,099
No. I tried, but I couldn't.

545
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,410
I guess it's too difficult for you alone.

- If you give me one more day...
- Let's...

547

548

- Get up.
- Pardon?

549

Okay...

550

Gosh, this one is stuck here.

551
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:18,709
I watched hundreds of action movies
to make it work.

552
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:20,400
It didn't work.

553
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,860
Gosh, I can't do this anymore.

554
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,519
I'm so tired that
I want to get some sleep.

555
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:29,849
Sure, I will get going then...

556
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:33,510
No, continue.
You should finish it today.

557
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,939
I will get some sleep briefly and get up.

558
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,200
Okay.

559
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,050
I'm so hot.

560
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,400
I will go change my clothes.

561
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,090
Man, why is she changing now?

562
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,189
Is she hitting on me or what?

563
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,590
Should I leave?
What should I do now?

564
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,380
Leave or not?

565
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,849
Should I leave?

566
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,300
Do you want something to drink?

567

No thank you.

Oh my, are you okay?

576
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:12,800
I'm okay. I'm really okay.

577
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,720
My cell phone fell, so...

578
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,220
where did it go?

579
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,130

I'd make a move on you, didn't you?

580

I'm sorry that I acted like I knew you.

I really want to tell you.

605
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,970
But I might get beaten
to death if I tell you.

606
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,349
But with this news,
you will completely forget everything.

607
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:20,150
I have a hidden card

00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,660
If we had the same interests

609
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,760
I'd take you out for some fun.

614
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:58,079

615
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,550
I'm too tired to go upstairs.

616
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:37,950
- I'm home.
- Did you have dinner?

617
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,999
I did.

618
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:41,470

Why isn't the medicinie working yet?

623
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,760

- Can you do this, please?
- Okay.

628
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,380
What is this?

629
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:54,099
<i>If I walk around in my small

<i>I think about him less.</i>

631
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,400
<i>Because all I think about is my feet. </i>

632
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:07,800
<i>And I take the shoes off when I get home.</i>

633
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,619
<i>I become happy for only a brief time. </i>

<i>I get so sad thinking about you</i>

more and more.</i>

639
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:43,450
<i>I'm trying to walk forward.</i>

640
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,400
<i>But my mind is crying
to try to go backward.</i>

641
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,700
<i>I want it to hurt me more and more. </i>

642
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:57,479
<i>If it hurts so I can't
even lift my fingers</i>

643
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,880
<i>or even be myself...</i>

644
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,519
<i>I get to stop thinking about him. </i>

645
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:08,249

646
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:12,450
