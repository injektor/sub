<i>[Another Oh Hae Young]</i>

3
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,930
You're like a drug, Park Do Kyung.
I feel all better now.

4
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,647
I don't have any fever either.

5
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,683
You've been through a lot.

6
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,472
Thank you for your efforts.

7
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,774
Both of us.

8
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:04,121
We've both tried hard.

9
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:08,379
If you hadn't chased after me,
we would have been over.

10
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:10,928
Thank you.

11
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:16,445
I thought you'd give me a half-hearted
apology and go your own way.

12
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,155
I thought about it.

13
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,100
What if I die?

14
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:32,393
If I'd look back on this moment as I die.

15
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,954
My conclusion was... it's all nothing.

16
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:40,044
No need to be cautious.

17
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:44,811
Let's go as far as my heart takes me.
Let's not hold back and just go.

18
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,367
I like that phrase.

19
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:53,022
"Let's go as far as my heart takes me.
Let's not hold back and just go."

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,572
All the men I knew were pitiful.

21
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:05,930
Men who would test the waters.
Me who would be cautious.

22
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,701
Men who would dump women because
they were ashamed of their failures.

23
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:13,484
I never had a man who would move me by

24
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,749
just fearlessly charging at me.

25
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,965
I was emotionless.

26
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:26,029
I'm insanely happy right now.

27
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:33,470
If I ever see you
being cautious from now on

28
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,700
- I'm going to kill you.
- Go ahead.

29
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,141
If you keep going back and forth,
I won't forgive you.

30
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:42,952
- I won't go back and forth.
- I will go back and forth.

31
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:45,550
Do it. You can.

32
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:58,702
<i>[Episode 14: Silence All the Other
Sounds that are Not of Love]</i>

33
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,099
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

34
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,058
We checked the rooftop and staircase of
the hospital! We thought you were dead!

35
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:35,481
Where have you been?

36
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,993
I came home because
I was feeling all better.

37
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:40,635
You should have told us
you were going home!

38
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,798
I just came home because
I didn't see you guys.

39
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,596
Young people freaking heal quickly.

40
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:05,700
From the vision that you saw

41
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,055
you two broke up, and that was it.

42
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:11,089
But in real life,
it changed to you two dating...

43
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,728
Then it has changed!

44
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:19,142
It has changed! Hey! Do Kyung! Do Kyung!

45
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,755
Congratulations! Congratulations!

46
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,753
This is a victory of the human race!

47
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,853
You've changed your fate!

48
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,817
But what's with your expression?
You look too calm.

49
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:39,760
Shouldn't you be happier?

50
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,599
Rather than not loving her at all

51
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,101
I should love her as much
as possible before I leave, right?

52
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:47,197
That will make her happier, right?

53
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:49,380
Leave? Who is leaving?

54
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,709
Why would you die?
Things have changed! Why would you die?

55
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,574
In your vision, you let that woman go.

56
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:02,647
That's why you were regretful
as you were dying.

57
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:05,993
But you said you are with her now.
Then your fate has changed.

58
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:08,128
Your present has changed.
How could your future not?

59
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:10,437
That's why there are flaws
in predestination

60
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,464
and why some of prophesiers'
prophecies are wrong now and then.

61
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:17,978
They can't predict what
the heart will do. What love will do.

62
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,751
Love!

63
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:24,121
What's wrong? Are you worried?

64
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,113
For leaving behind the woman you love?

65
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,762
From now on, there's only
one thing you need to do.

66
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:36,028
Until your feet sweat

67
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,086
love.

68
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:40,676
I'm so jealous!

69
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:50,300
<i>What are you up to?</i>

70
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,300
<i>I'm on my way to work.</i>

71
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,189
<i>I just left my house. How about you?</i>

72
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:58,890
- I'm on my way to work too.
- Oh my god!

73
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,283
You scared me!

74
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,368
I love starting my morning seeing you.

75
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,974
Get in. I'll take you.

76
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,645
I think I could do anything.

77
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:20,448
I feel like I could even commit murder.

78
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,026
Keep it together.

79
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:25,193
Just pick a person for real.
I'll kill him for you.

80
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:53,189
Fine. I've got it, Mom. Don't worry.

81
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:57,770
Of course I won't.
Okay. I love you.

82
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,717
You're still a three-year-old.

83
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:09,097
No man dances the moment he wakes up.

84
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:13,283
- Ask me why I'm so happy.
- I'm too lazy. Just tell me.

85
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:15,387
I'm going to hit it big.

86
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,588
I just had this amazing dream.

87
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,844
Mom told me not to tell anyone...

88
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:25,662
Just keep this between you two.

89
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:28,584
Mom told me this is an amazing dream.

90
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:29,955
A great one!

91
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,306
I don't normally ever have dreams.

92
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:39,983
But this is the first time in my life
I've had such a vivid dream.

93
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:41,603
What was your dream about?

94
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,890
The stars in the sky
were shining brightly

95
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,300
as if they were covered in gold.

96
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:55,060
But all of a sudden, they started moving
and formed a fish shape.

97
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,796
And it was as if it was alive.
It kept on flopping.

98
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:02,314
As it was suddenly falling from the sky

99
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:06,320
- I hurried over and caught it.
- You caught it? You didn't drop it?

100
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,507
Of course! I caught it! Perfectly
in my hands. Don't ruin it for me.

101
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,974
Anyway.

102
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,619
As I woke up from my dream
and opened my eyes...

103
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,508
I felt...

104
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:25,511
very excited, yet serene.

105
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:28,871
It felt like I had heard God's voice.

106
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:32,551
"Your era has come."

107
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:35,509
- Sell it to me for 5,000 won.
- You crazy bastard.

108
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,523
Don't sell that dream. Don't sell it.
Not even for 100 million won.

109
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,844
Of course I won't!

110
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,326
I heard it means
I'll be the Minister of Justice.

111
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,661
Isn't it too early for this?

112
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,816
We should meet up for dinner.
I'll buy you something good.

113
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,305
There is this great steakhouse I know.

114
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:06,456
What would you do without me?
I always look after you.

115
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:09,273
So you should just hurry
and tell your family.

116
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:11,763
They'll all find out once you
start having a baby bump.

117
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:14,623
By the way, did you let
the baby's dad know? That guy in Brazil?

118
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:17,722
What's wrong?

119
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,583
Do you not even know his number?

120
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,001
Not even his e-mail address
or something?

121
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:30,400
That bastard.

122
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,834
Give me his biographical data.
I'll look him up for you.

123
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:37,315
- He's not the baby's father.
- What?

124
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:40,550
- What do you mean?
- It's not him. The baby's father.

125
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,999
But you don't have
any other man than him.

126
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:51,417
What's this? By any chance...

127
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,094
- It was from an one-night stand?
- Mind your own business.

128
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,009
Oh my god. It was really from
an one-night stand? Seriously?

129
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,972
I said mind your own business.

130
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,331
I'm going to raise the kid
by myself anyway.

131
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,704
Only I should know
who the baby's father is.

132
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:18,175
It's not that guy in Brazil.
So don't cause trouble for his family.

133
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:20,914
And don't go around
blabbing about the baby's dad.

134
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:23,374
Also...

135
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:26,560
- I'm going to move to another country.
- What? Why?

136
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,954
If I live in Korea

137
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:32,186
I'll get tired of being constantly
asked about the baby's father.

138
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,901
The kid will feel burdened too.

139
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,903
I should move to another country
and raise the kid in peace.

140
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:40,949
You can't raise a kid by yourself in
another country. You'd feel sad.

141
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:43,888
Just raise your kid in Korea.
You'll have Do Kyung and me.

142
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:46,070
We can all raise the kid together.

143
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,129
I won't ignore you once I hit it big.

144
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,157
Just raise the kid in Korea!
Where would you even go?

145
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:54,400
- Shut up. Forget it.
- No. You forget it.

146
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,705
I'm late. Let's go.

147
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,227
We have arrived.

148
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:16,185
Soo Kyung. I'll see you tonight!

149
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:19,401
Okay? Stay strong! Cheer up!

150
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:27,099
<i>If I tell you I'm pregnant with
your baby, you'll probably pass out.</i>

151
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,599
<i>And things will get
really awkward between us.</i>

152
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,540
<i>I'll keep this a secret for life.</i>

153
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,204
<i>Raising the kid by myself
would be the right thing to do.</i>

154
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,032
<i>Let's just maintain
our sibling-like relationship.</i>

155
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,147
<i>Thanks for having
the conception dream for the baby.</i>

156
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:53,599
<i>I'll keep it in my memory.</i>

157
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,065
<i>The stars. The fish.</i>

158
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,128
How funny.

159
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,276
You don't have to explain yourself.

160
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:34,561
A man and woman making up
and breaking up are like

161
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:38,262
the sunrise and rainfall.

162
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,684
We are not going to break up.

163
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,441
Don't break up. Ever.

164
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,378
Congratulations.

165
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,400
<i>[1 out of 38 in class.
2 out of 500 in entire school.]</i>

166
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,844
<i>[Name: Oh Hae Young]</i>
Oh my! Oh my! Oh my god!

167
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:50,108
Oh my! She must have gone crazy! Honey!

168
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,026
Hae Young must have gone crazy!

169
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,263
What is it?

170
00:16:56,886 --> 00:17:01,117
She got first place in her class.
Second in her entire school.

171
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:03,681
She placed second out of 500 kids.

172
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:06,885
Of course!
She should go to University of Seoul.

173
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,756
Sure. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

174
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,019
- Who are you calling now?
- My sister-in-law.

175
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,624
- That's enough.
- What do you mean?

176
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:20,500
She's always bragging about
her daughter's academic success.

177
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,318
She has to hear me brag too.

178
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,442
She would've never guessed
this day would come.

179
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:30,342
It's me. Have you had dinner yet?

180
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:34,874
By the way, did you get
Seo Hee's report card yet?

181
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:40,481
Hae Young missed the top place in
the entire school just by a little.

182
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,505
I'll get the door.

183
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,701
I think our report cards were switched.

184
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,545
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

185
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,466
I'll give it to you in school tomorrow.

186
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:08,832
Could I...

187
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:12,583
get it signed before giving it to you?

188
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,501
Then I'll get it signed
and give it back to you too.

189
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,461
Ms. Oh, please come in.

190
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:50,643
Normally, I always place first
or second out of the entire school.

191
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:54,507
But I didn't study this time.
I just guessed on all the questions.

192
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,521
It seems like I'll be
getting a divorce again.

193
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,219
I want to get out of this house.

194
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:27,062
My stomach hurts.

195
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:30,395
That's what I thought. There's no way.

196
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:34,084
Number 27, Oh Hae Young.

197
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:38,236
B, C, C, B, D, D, D, C, D...

198
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,344
I was scared for a moment.

199
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,210
I thought Hae Young had actually
placed second out of all the students.

200
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,825
- Why would that scare you?
- Huh?

201
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:51,354
I... don't know.

202
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:54,172
I don't know why it did...

203
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,748
It's okay! Eat up!

204
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:07,212
Why would they put two girls
with the same name in the same class?

205
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,142
You should have picked up on it.

206
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,679
She usually places in the 200s or 300s.

207
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,132
How could you believe she came
in second in the entire school?

208
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:16,705
Of course their report cards
were switched.

209
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,593
Hae Young. Thanks to you,
I've had a good laugh.

210
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:44,220
<i>[Oh Hae Young]</i>

211
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:52,017
- So you're that Oh Hae Young?
- Yes.

212
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:55,876
Her eyes are too big.

213
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:06,451
It's fine! Grades aren't everything!

214
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,363
<i>That's when I got this feeling.</i>

215
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:17,751
<i>The feeling that I would forever
come in second to you.</i>

216
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:20,170
<i>The feeling that I won't be
able to do anything</i>

217
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,872
<i>about the kids
who were raised with love.</i>

218
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:50,922
This is buy one, get one free.
So you can take another one of these.

<i>[Passionate Bottle Opener]</i>

220
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,200
You thought
I'd make a move on you, didn't you?

221
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,888
Thank you. Bye!

222
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:27,729
Why do you seem so down?

223
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:29,767
I...

224
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:32,948
think I know why I can't be successful.

225
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,961
Why not?

226
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,395
I can't be a success...

227
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:40,122
because I love you.

228
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,011
Who is trying to seduce you?
Must be a powerful woman.

229
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:48,922
You're a bit like that. Must be nice
to be so quick on the uptake.

230
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:52,211
I have these special senses
all throughout my body.

231
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:53,915
My entire body is a tentacle.

232
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,304
I'm so proud of you.

233
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,347
It's hard not to be
seduced by a woman.

234
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:04,844
You didn't fall for her
even when she offered you success?

235
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,276
Good boy.

236
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,699
Here you go. Have a sausage.

237
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,965
Welcome.

238
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,055
If I could love you

239
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:27,879
and be successful...

240
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:42,019
What should we do? They're going to
mow the barley field tomorrow.

241
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,538
We're in a hurry to get
more filming done there too.

242
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:48,036
- When are they mowing it?
<i>- Tomorrow morning.</i>

243
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:51,930
You should've worked out
a better schedule!

244
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,058
I'm sorry.

245
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,010
What would you like to do?

246
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,353
It would be nice for us
if you could come

247
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,276
but I feel bad asking you to.

248
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:03,871
If you can get its sound recorded at
another location, that's fine too.

249
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,768
All right. Okay.

250
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,016
We should just go.

251
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,259
If not there, we have to
go all the way to Go Chang.

252
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,110
They're mowing that field next week too.

253
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,690
They should just leave it.
Why mow it? It looks pretty.

254
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,505
- They need to harvest it.
- Weren't they there for the view?

255
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:30,330
Can we get there and back by today?

256
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,814
When will you be back?

257
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,577
Tomorrow?

258
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:44,519
Tomorrow won't do!
So I can't see you until tomorrow?

259
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:52,196
I guess there is no other way.
Work comes first.

260
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:55,700
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

261
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:58,881
<i>If I'm still alive by tomorrow,
I'll see you then.</i>

262
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:02,986
If I die from missing you too much,
I guess I won't be able to see you.

263
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:05,860
Let's see if I'm alive until tomorrow.

264
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,674
I'm hanging up.

265
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:20,325
- Yes. What do you need?
<i>- I have a favor to ask.</i>

266
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:21,707
What is it?

267
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,455
Let Assistant Manager Oh
work out of the office today.

268
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:28,094
- She can leave work from there.
- Don't be ridiculous.

269
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:29,759
- Can't you make it happen?
- No.

270
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,347
- Just this once.
- Forget it.

271
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:35,538
I'll be good to you from now on.

274
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:51,630
She won't allow it?

275
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:07,976
Hello.

276
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,706
Who's buying these?

277
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,200
I am. I feel bad for
all the things I've done.

00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:26,413
By the way...

279
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:29,063
If you'd like to hang out with me,
today is the only day.

I'm free today only.

281

Maybe we should drop them in the city
where they could lie down and rest.

340
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:09,803
Wouldn't you prefer those places?

341
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,821
- You bastard!
- Your mouth!

342
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:17,254
Your mouth always causes trouble!
My goodness.

343
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:19,452
Let's go! Let's drive!

344
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,323
Let's go.

345
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:32,885
No one is around.
Let me hug you.

346
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:36,200
Here.

347
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,551
It's still daytime.

348
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:52,755
- Let's go.
- So what if it is daytime?

349
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:55,266
What? What have I done?

350
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:10,761
<i>[C.E.O: Lee Chan Soo]</i>

351
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,815
<i>[C.E.O: Han Tae Jin]</i>

352
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:21,790
You've been waiting long, right?

353
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,028
You should have called me first.

354
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:27,170
I had to go into customs
early in the morning...

355
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,100
The office has been expanded. Seems like
it's better off than when I was here.

356
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,892
They say the good comes with the bad.

357
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:37,075
Not long after that happened to you,
the European market starting buying.

358
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:39,167
After seeing that, all these banks

359
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,288
that couldn't have cared less
finally started making investments.

360
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:45,482
When we had begged them for loans

361
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,400
they didn't blink an eye.

362
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,795
What do you need me to do now?

363
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,970
What should I do?

364
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:04,029
Take your time.
You've just gotten out of jail.

365
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,875
Did you work things out with Hae Young?

366
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,899
Is it going smoothly?

367
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:11,209
We don't have anything to work out.

368
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:14,163
Of course I'll give you
your position back.

369
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:15,888
We've been through a lot together.

370
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:19,132
Look after Hae Young first.
Just hurry and get married.

371
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:23,408
Don't hurt her again by investing
all of your time in your work and stuff.

372
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:24,997
I think she should take priority.

373
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,142
Let's go. Let's get something to eat.

374
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:40,134
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.
Appropriate rates may apply...</i>

375
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:46,310
Is this Seo Bu Police Department?

376
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:50,922
Yes. We're looking for Ms. Oh Hae Young?
Oh Hae Young.

377
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:56,145
But they told us they were
from Seo Bu Police Department.

378
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,777
They took her with them.

379
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:16,741
- Those guys aren't our people.
- They're not?

380
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,743
Oh my...

381
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:23,596
Apparently, they weren't the police.

382
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:26,172
No. They weren't the police.

383
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:28,145
- You can zoom in on that car, right?
- Yes.

384
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:34,741
- These bastards are pros.
- Pros?

385
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:37,522
They've purposely hid
the license plates from view.

386
00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:40,067
Then what should we do?

387
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,102
<i>Excuse us. This is the police.</i>

388
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:57,968
<i>This is Ms. Oh Hae Young's house, right?</i>

389
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,969
Ms. Oh Hae Young was kidnapped
by unidentified assailants.

390
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,290
So we're investigating.

391
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,339
There are two Oh Hae Youngs.

392
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:21,000
There is another Oh Hae Young
other than my daughter.

393
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:32,939
- Ma'am, wake up.
- Ma'am, are you okay?

394
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:33,939
Ma'am.

395
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:39,089
The barking of dogs
in the countryside in early evening...

396
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,609
I like that sound the most at this hour.

397
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,460
On a cold winter morning

398
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,379
I like hearing the sound of
shoveling snow under my blanket.

399
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,450
Around four in the afternoon

400
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,689
the sound of a little boy
running down a hill.

401
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,120
And...

402
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:29,589
the sound of a music box.

403
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,100
It sounds pretty.

404
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,350
And there is a sound I'd like to hear.

405
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,480
You saying my name.

406
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:56,489
You've never called me Hae Young.

407
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:05,839
Hae Young is still her, not me, huh?

408
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:17,239
I'm sorry I'm arguing again.
It's so petty of me.

409
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,080
It's quite okay.

410
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,549
It's the name you called
somebody else for a long time.

411
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,279
I thought you might think that way,
so that's why I couldn't call you that.

412
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,870
You might think
I'm calling somebody else.

413
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,350
I was afraid you'd think I call your name
thinking about the other Hae Young.

414
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,060
You may be right.

415
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,049
But my name is Hae Young, after all.

416
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,259
Just call me by my name.

417
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,020
I won't think about the other
Oh Hae Young when I look at you.

418
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,169
I hope you feel comfortable.

419
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,830
And call me by my name.

420
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,910
I want to ask for a favor too.

421
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:06,299
No matter what Han Tae Jin
does to me, don't get involved.

422
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,410
No matter what he does

423
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,390
it's right to take it all.

424
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,790
I've done so much wrong.

425
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,850
I even took you away from him too.

426
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:20,390
So whatever he puts me through...

427
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,000
don't get involved.

428
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:26,520
Don't think about Oh Hae Young
when you look at me.

429
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,460
And I will pay for my wrongdoing.

430
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,680
Let's do it that way, shall we?

431
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,689
Plus...

432
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,299
Stop putting distance between us
with how you address me.

433
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:43,080
What is up with that?

434
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,169
What should I call you then?

435
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,830
You know what it is.

436
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,680
- What is it?
- That.

437
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,640
What is it?

438
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,069
Honey.

439
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:22,149
Hae Young.

440
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,844
Honey.

441
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:27,899
Hae Young.

442
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,980
Honey.

443
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:34,129
Hae Young.

444
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,299
Honey.

445
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:41,680
Hae Young.

446
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,460
No more honey.

447
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:25,370
- Open your eyes.
- What?

448
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,379
I want you to look at the stars.

449
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,060
Shall we just die today?

450
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:56,609
I'd want to die when I'm happiest.

451
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:08,660
Park Do Kyung!

452
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:11,200
Park Do Kyung!

453
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,930
Why don't you answer?

454
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,930
I know you're there!

455
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,520
You're surrounded right now!

456
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:21,830
What kind of outrageous date is this?

457
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,649
You're in someone's barley field!

458
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:25,980
You've been here all day!

459
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,169
Why don't you wrap up
whatever you were doing?

460
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:29,899
Come out now!

461
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,560
I said come out now!

462
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,509
Wow, you do look like detectives.

463
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,439
You sure do.

464
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:05,919
The crime of impersonating a cop
and obstruction of justice.

465
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,430
You're in big trouble now.

466
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,330
Officer Park...

467
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:16,569
Gosh, we are in trouble.

468
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:21,700
<i>Such bastards!</i>

469
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,569
<i>When they are so old,
how could they pull off such a thing?</i>

470
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:27,339
You! I will break your legs!

471
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,160
I will lock you up in the house.

472
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,890
Otherwise, I will die
sooner than expected!

473
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,270
<i>Of all the things,
you pulled off such a crazy stunt!</i>

474
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,969
<i>When you come home</i>

475
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:37,859
<i>you will die by my hands!</i>

476
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:39,480
<i>You bitch!</i>

477
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,310
I'm sorry.

478
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,919
You keep her.

480
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,370
Take her.

481
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,810
Just let him take her.

482
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,930
Well...

483
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,359
- What do you think? Good, right?
- It's okay.

484
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,160
That makes me sad.

485
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,319
Do you know how much this is?

486
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:00,750
Are you crazy?

487
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,390
Don't you know not to eat pineapple
while you're pregnant?

488
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,879
You don't know much, do you?

489
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:06,370
You are a soon-to-be mom.

490
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,680
It's all theory.

491
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,430
Whatever it is, wouldn't it
feel safer not to have it?

492
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,109
I want to come over.

493
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,020
I haven't been able to do so,
because it's not good...

494
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:16,230
when there is
someone pregnant in the house.

495
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,799
Do a search on the Internet.

496
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,919
On what's allowed
and what's not during pregnancy.

497
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:22,689
Now you'll have a lot of time
since you won't be drinking.

498
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,259
Look who is here.

499
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:28,890
Excuse me.

500
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,899
What's going on?

501
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,710
How are they walking in together?

502
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,000
What are they doing here?

503
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,439
What are you guys doing?
What's going on?

504
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,399
Don't mind me
and take care of your business.

505
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,899
I just came here to eat.

506
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:31,629
She knows what kind of
human being you are, huh?

507
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:34,750
I do know. Carry on.

508
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,210
I saw your cell phone.

509
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,120
I wondered what you saved me as.

510
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,520
As your darling or just my name?

511
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,969
I was saved as Mon.

512
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:52,140
I wondered what Mon meant.

513
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,819
But then again, there were Tue, Wed...

514
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:57,290
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat.

515
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,879
Wait, there was no Sun.

516
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:01,700
Is it your day off?

517
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,290
How do you like seeing
us all at the same time?

518
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:09,140
I thought about how to end it.

519
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,580
It can't be fun to just end it, you know.

520
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,569
Six of us are thinking about
beating you up all together.

521
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:36,879
Wait, seriously?

522
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:39,910
We could talk about this.

523
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,060
Why are you doing this?
This is not the way, seriously!

524
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,060
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

525
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,609
Don't touch him and walk away.

526
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,689
Why bother getting your hands dirty?

527
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:57,719
It's partially your fault that you
fell for him for his profession.

528
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:59,719
Why are you butting in?
Who the hell are you, old lady?

529
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:01,960
I'm Mademoiselle. I'm Miss.

530
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,810
I'm the one for Sundays.

531
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,379
He's with me on Sundays.

532
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:11,379
We live together.

533
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,310
- You're married?
- No, no. I'm not married...

534
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,989
I'll give you advice
as someone who's been there.

535
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:26,770
Don't focus on
appearance, job, or money.

536
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:30,219
Go out with a guy
for his personality.

537
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,930
Ooh-la-la.

538
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,960
Never mind.

539
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,509
You should have the right character
to be able to tell the difference.

540
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,000
Fine. Continue to focus on the outside.

541
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,640
Keep focusing on the outside
and meeting losers like him.

542
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,129
Fighting!

543
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,200
You seriously!

544
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,219
Ma'am, you're scaring me.

545
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,250
What was that about?
It was so girly.

546
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,270
Thank you. You handled it at once.

547
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,419
It's always better for a woman
to handle another woman.

548
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:34,049
Don't you think so?

549
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,569
How am I going to find
all different women for each day?

550
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,710
I'm sorry.

551
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,770
Jin Sang.

552
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:00,390
When I think about
how you were in high school

553
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,210
you were so adorable in every way.

554
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:09,719
You were adorable when you came home
crying when your principal passed away.

555
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:13,350
You were adorable when you pushed
the cart in the neighborhood...

556
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,500
for the old man who was picking up trash.

557
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,390
When you were studying with Do Kyung

558
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:24,609
you two waited for me
at the bus stop when I was late.

559
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,879
So when I saw you at the bus stop

560
00:50:28,879 --> 00:50:33,730
you were adorable
and it made me happy.

561
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:38,759
When I think about
how you were in high school

562
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:41,469
you were adorable in every way.

563
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:49,419
Why did you change all of a sudden?

564
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:52,980
I'm sure only you know the reason.

565
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,149
Something must have happened, huh?

566
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:02,589
Jin Sang, by the way...

567
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,480
you're such a cool guy.

568
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,100
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

569
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,500
You make me want to cry.

570
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,600
Stop blaming yourself.

571
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,000
Meet someone nice and marry her.

572
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,540
And...

573
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,109
Make sure you become
the Minister of Justice.

574
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,980
<i>I won't tell the kid
that you're the father.</i>

575
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,390
<i>But I want the baby's father
to be someone worthy</i>

576
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,140
<i>even if he won't be around.</i>

577
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,939
<i>The father who is respectable and cool.</i>

578
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,160
<i>There are two men who
joined the company at the same time. </i>

579
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,910
<i>We will see the reaction
of the one who failed at his job. </i>

580
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,049
<i>- Too much.
- I'm full.</i>

581
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:22,319
<i>It feels good after a workout
during the lunchtime. </i>

582
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,629
<i>Excuse me, Na Sang Gyu.
Na Sang Gyu!</i>

583
00:52:25,629 --> 00:52:28,219
<i>How can you sleep after lunch?</i>

584
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:31,339
<i>Manager, after lunch is
the perfect time to get some sleep. </i>

585
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:33,319
<i>You young fellow.</i>

586
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:36,629
<i>You always sleep after lunch.
That's what happened to your belly.</i>

587
00:52:36,629 --> 00:52:38,450
<i>You should exercise like I do.</i>

588
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,080
Crazy girl.

589
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,180
What are they thinking?

590
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,680
Just let them be.

591
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,049
I don't think it will work

592
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:50,500
to force them to separate.

593
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,330
- Your chicken is ready.
- Thank you.

594
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,040
- You don't deliver, do you?
- No. I'm sorry.

595
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,399
Well, if it's good,
it's never too far.

596
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:06,819
It takes 10 minutes by foot.
Thank you.

597
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:08,759
Thank you. Bye.

598
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,669
After I became an attorney

599
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:22,000
I never thought I'd have
to bail out Park Do Kyung one day.

600
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,859
What is it about her, huh?

601
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:25,259
He's completely in love with her.

602
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:27,259
I was with her today.
She was talkative.

603
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,879
- She was very talkative.
- He wouldn't like someone talkative.

604
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:33,310
She must have something
amazing other than that.

605
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,290
What is it about her that attracts him?

606
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,779
Ask him directly.

607
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:40,040
You think he'll tell us what it is, huh?

608
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,770
I told you not to drink it
out of the bottle, Dog Jin Sang!

609
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,080
My mouth isn't dirty like yours.

610
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,989
Dog Jin Sang, get a cup!
Get a cup!

611
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:52,049
- Get a cup! Get a cup!
- Nah!

612
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,319
Say it again.

613
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,000
Dog Jin Sang?

614
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,710
You're way younger than he is.
How dare you kick him?

615
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,000
How dare you add "dog" to his name?

616
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,680
What's gotten into you?
I've been doing that for years.

617
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,790
Because of his name, he already seems
more like a nasty piece of work.

618
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,120
How dare you add
"dog" in front of his name?

619
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,569
You're making him sound like
a more nasty piece of work.

620
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:29,319
Jin Sang is 36 years old
and will be 40 soon.

621
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:32,399
Will you still call him
Dog Jin Sang after he's 40?

622
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:35,290
After he's married with kids,
will you still call him Dog Jin Sang?

623
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,390
You've said "Dog Jin Sang"
more that I have now.

624
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,069
From now on, treat him with respect.

625
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:45,460
And he's being rude
when he's way younger.

626
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,489
Why are you letting him do that to you?

627
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,029
There is a difference
between being close and rude.

628
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:53,060
If he crosses the line

629
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,060
you should warn him.

630
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:58,489
You get treated well
only if you ask for it.

631
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:00,239
Don't let others treat you badly in life.

632
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:02,290
What's gotten into you?
It feels weird.

633
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,739
You're treating him badly.

634
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:07,089
It makes me uncomfortable.
So stop it.

635
00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:09,049
You've been treating him
worse than we have.

636
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:11,589
- Why?
- I said stop!

637
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:23,129
I think I know why...

638
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:26,998
Oh my, I think I'm sensing things...

639
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,569
What is it?
Now what's wrong with you?

640
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,200
Please say no.

641
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,790
Say no. Please say no.

642
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,029
What are you two doing now?

643
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:53,100
Gosh, we never did it!

644
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,969
You've never done it with me!

645
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,540
No way! Such nonsense!

646
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,160
That dream!

647
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,100
You're right.

648
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,600
It was a precognitive dream
about the baby.

649
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:28,589
- No!
- You crazy bastard!

650
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:30,620
- You crazy bastard!
- No, it's not true!

651
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,529
It's not right. It wasn't me. Wait.

652
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:34,739
It wasn't me.

653
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,080
Hey, who is more miserable here?

654
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,430
Who is more miserable?

655
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,359
For the crime you've committed by
cheating on so many women all these years

656
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:44,069
You're sentenced for life,
which is to live with Park Soo Kyung.

657
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,489
You punk!

658
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,230
Hold him!

659
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,230
Hey!

660
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,239
- Hold him!
- Wait! No way!

661
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,080
You can't evoke the right
to remain silent, Dog Jin Sang!

662
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,299
No way!

663
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,640
Will it be too hard?

664
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,509
Will it work?

665
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:19,710
Hae Young.

666
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,649
Hae Young.

667
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:27,219
Honey.

668
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:29,219
<i>Hae Young.</i>

669
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,790
Yes?

670
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,910
Hae Young.

671
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:39,569
-<i> Honey.</i>
- Hae Young.

672
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:43,680
Honey.

673
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:46,100
Hae Young.

674
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,799
Honey.

675
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:52,859
<i>Hae Young.</i>

676
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,890
Honey.

677
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,899
Hae Young.

678
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,790
I'm sorry.

679
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:21,069
I know that I'm the crazier one
in this situation.

680
01:01:22,629 --> 01:01:25,850
I won't ask you to forgive him.

681
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,540
I also won't ask you to forgive me.

682
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,899
I will take all the blame.

683
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,469
Seriously...

684
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,600
You're making me a complete idiot.

685
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:51,930
I'm sorry.

686
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,149
Do Kyung.

687
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,669
- Are you off somewhere?
- On my way to a blind date.

688
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:00,750
I'm so transparent.

689
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,870
I poured my heart out
for you not too long ago.

690
01:03:03,799 --> 01:03:07,000
But this was arranged even before that.

691
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Sorry.

692
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:12,250
I'm glad to know
you'll be on a blind date.

693
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,609
- I'm late for the date.
- Go ahead.

694
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:19,259
See you next time.

695
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:24,529
Let's get together for a drink
with Hae Young some day.

696
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:26,819
Sure.

697
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,719
<i>The love that makes
someone want to die for the sake of...</i>

698
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:25,419
<i>can be the pain that makes
someone want to die for the sake of.</i>

699
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:31,069
<i>But I can't help
caring more about my love.</i>

700
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:38,069
Okay.

701
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,310
Seriously?

702
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,689
- It's done.
- Is it?

703
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:47,899
This was amazing.

704
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,879
I want to call in to let
everybody know we're going out.

705
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:09,680
That we're going out...

706
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,350
Hello. My father owned this house.

707
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,750
I heard that you wanted to buy it.

708
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,129
Do you still want to buy it?

709
01:06:53,299 --> 01:06:55,930
My father's passed away.

710
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:00,969
My father's passed away.

711
01:07:05,419 --> 01:07:06,419
Let's go beg for his forgiveness.

712
01:07:06,419 --> 01:07:08,469
It's taken us longer, but we've
ended up with the right people.

713
01:07:08,469 --> 01:07:10,239
From the woman who used to live here...

714
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:13,060
- Isn't it courteous to meet twice?
- Oh Hae Young who has left...

715
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,189
Too hot!

716
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,100
<i>I burnt my hands.</i>

717
01:08:13,399 --> 01:08:15,149
Luckily it's my left hand.

718
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:27,130
I was braising beef
and ended up spilling it all.

719
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,019
It always happens
when I try to do something new.

720
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:32,019
You haven't eaten, have you?

721
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,040
Ta-da!

722
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,899
Someone hurts themself
and someone dies.

723
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,090
So those things won't change, huh?

724
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:05,429
What's all this about?

725
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:22,635
