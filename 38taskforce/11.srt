<font color="yellow">What do you mean, Sir?</font>

75
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,030
<font color="yellow">Is it because of your daughter?</font>

76
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,830
<font color="yellow">Are you worried that she could be affiliated with it?</font>

77
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,490

<font color="yellow">don't ever make the same mistake again.</font>

87
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,930
<font color="yellow">It's a mistake to do it to anyone else,</font>

88
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,830
<font color="yellow">but not if you do it to me.</font>

89
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,430

92
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,790

94
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,600
<font color="yellow">It seemed urgent.</font>

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
<font color="yellow">I don't know...</font>

96
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
<font color="yellow">why.</font>

97
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,660

98
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,460

99

102
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,930
<font color="yellow">My father.</font>

103
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,260
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's say that we're partially responsible...</font>

104

<font color="yellow">for what happened to Director Kim.</font>

105
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,030
<font color="yellow">But not Detective Yang.</font>

106
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,190
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have done that.</font>

107
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,460
<font color="yellow">There's no point in talking about the past.</font>

108

<font color="yellow">Let's discuss work.</font>

109

110
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,830
<font color="yellow">We liquidated everything in two days.</font>

111
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,600
<font color="yellow">It happened while we were locked up,</font>

112
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,830
<font color="yellow">so you can't tie it to us.</font>

113
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,790
<font color="yellow">There's no proof, either.</font>

114
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,990
<font color="yellow">Now, do you feel like paying your taxes?</font>

115
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,260
<font color="yellow">What a wake-up call.</font>

116
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,930
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

145
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,730

164
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,630
<font color="yellow">Your close friend can't get you the refund.</font>

165
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,960
<font color="yellow">There's no other way.</font>

166
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,760
<font color="yellow">If you want the money back,</font>

167
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,890

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,860
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for this,</font>

178
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,360
<font color="yellow">why else would I have made someone like you a director?</font>

179
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

180
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
<font color="yellow">Take her.</font>

187
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,490
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't take a bribe.</font>

188

190
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,360
<font color="yellow">You're a scumbag cop who took dirty money, not a friend.</font>

191
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260

<font color="yellow">Jae Sung, how could you?</font>

193
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,690
<font color="yellow">Apologise and it'll all be over.</font>

194
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,990
<font color="yellow">How dare you threaten me.</font>

195
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,290
<font color="yellow">This is no time to be stubborn.</font>

196
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,830
<font color="yellow">Your daughter's antiques...</font>

197
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,630
<font color="yellow">were worth a total of 49.88 million dollars.</font>

198

199
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,290
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to give it back to you if you will apologise.</font>

200

<font color="yellow">Watch it, you jerk.</font>

201
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,290
<font color="yellow">Did you just curse?</font>

202
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,030
<font color="yellow">At me?</font>

203
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,330
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,330
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

207
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,490
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

208
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,090
<font color="yellow">I'm impressed.</font>

209
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,860
<font color="yellow">Where is he right now?</font>

210
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,960
<font color="yellow">No, hang on.</font>

211
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,390
<font color="yellow">Jung Do doesn't have the money.</font>

212
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,860
<font color="yellow">Ms Noh has it.</font>

213
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,490
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

214
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,360
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

215
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,060
<font color="yellow">It's me, Ms Noh.</font>

216
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,030
<font color="yellow">He doesn't need the money. Go ahead as planned.</font>

217
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,460
<font color="yellow">He cursed at me.</font>

218
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,800
<font color="yellow">Okay. I got it.</font>

219
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,860
<font color="yellow">It'll take about five minutes.</font>

220
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,990
<font color="yellow">Five minutes?</font>

221
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,760
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

222
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,890
<font color="yellow">What takes five minutes?</font>

223
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,460
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know, but that's the time you have.</font>

224
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,060
<font color="yellow">If you don't apologise to me, you'll lose 10 million a minute.</font>

225
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,890
<font color="yellow">Are you still not up for it?</font>

226
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,560
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

227
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,800
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

228
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,090
<font color="yellow">Okay. Point taken.</font>

229
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,800
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

230
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,760
<font color="yellow">All it would take is one apology and you just wouldn't do it.</font>

231
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,860
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

232

257
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,560

<font color="yellow">then picked up what they could.</font>

318
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
<font color="yellow">Estimated to be around 50 million,</font>

319
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
<font color="yellow">the cash in the sky...</font>

320
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,260
<font color="yellow">Sir, Mr Bang...</font>

321
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,590
<font color="yellow">Is it a mess?</font>

322
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

323
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,290
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

324
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,090
<font color="yellow">Thanks for helping.</font>

325
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,020
<font color="yellow">What a waste.</font>

326
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

327
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,120
<font color="yellow">It wasn't my money. It was Chairman Wang's.</font>

328
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,220
<font color="yellow">I only did as he instructed me.</font>

329
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,490
<font color="yellow">Don't thank me.</font>

330
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
<font color="yellow">Still. I should.</font>

331
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,760
<font color="yellow">Look after yourself.</font>

332
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,990
<font color="yellow">Thank your assistant for me.</font>

333
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,990
<font color="yellow">Will he...</font>

334
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,460
<font color="yellow">be okay?</font>

335
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
<font color="yellow">Who do you mean?</font>

336
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,020
<font color="yellow">Sung Il.</font>

337
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,520
<font color="yellow">Will he be okay?</font>

338
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,520
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped.</font>

339
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,520
<font color="yellow">What's done was done.</font>

340
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,560
<font color="yellow">If I say so now,</font>

341
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,660
<font color="yellow">I helped you for Chairman Wang.</font>

342
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,620
<font color="yellow">That's what brought me this far.</font>

343
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,590
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

344
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,760
<font color="yellow">don't expect my help any more.</font>

345
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,860
<font color="yellow">Figure your own way on and out.</font>

346
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,820
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

347
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

348
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,290
<font color="yellow">I won't call you until I die.</font>

349
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,920
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

350
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,860
<font color="yellow">Be well.</font>

351
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,360
<font color="yellow">Get even richer.</font>

352
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,020
<font color="yellow">I'm off.</font>

353
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,420
<font color="yellow">I helped him despite being threatened by a detective.</font>

354
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,990
<font color="yellow">He stabbed me in the back.</font>

355
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,690
<font color="yellow">You won't see me again.</font>

356
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,890
<font color="yellow">The cops will be after me.</font>

357
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,920
<font color="yellow">I have to run.</font>

358
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,690
<font color="yellow">Jung Do ruined everything.</font>

359
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,260
<font color="yellow">Min Sik,</font>

360
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,720
<font color="yellow">Chang Ho, Noh Seung.</font>

361
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
<font color="yellow">I can never face them again.</font>

362
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,420
<font color="yellow">It's all his fault.</font>

363
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,420
<font color="yellow">Don't hate him too much.</font>

364
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,190
<font color="yellow">He didn't keep it for himself.</font>

365
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,860
<font color="yellow">It's not about how you take the money.</font>

366
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,160
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about how you spend it?</font>

367
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,020
<font color="yellow">Think that it went straight to the people...</font>

368
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
<font color="yellow">without going through you.</font>

369
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,290
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

370
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,660
<font color="yellow">Everyone has a different theory about where the money came from.</font>

371
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,620
<font color="yellow">The police and government officials who arrived belatedly...</font>

372
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,760
<font color="yellow">on the scene said...</font>

373
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,690
<font color="yellow">Some even got into fights...</font>

374
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,790
<font color="yellow">trying to take as many bills as they could reach.</font>

375
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,520
<font color="yellow">Dozens of calls came in from people...</font>

376
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,960
<font color="yellow">who needed the police to help settle claims over the bills.</font>

377
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,960
<font color="yellow">The money was thrown...</font>

378
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,860
<font color="yellow">in just five minutes from multiple rooftops,</font>

379
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,760
<font color="yellow">but the ripple effect will be greater than imagined.</font>

380
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,620
<font color="yellow">According to witness statements,</font>

381
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,460
<font color="yellow">the money was thrown in an area with heavy foot traffic...</font>

382
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,360
<font color="yellow">from a few of the tall commercial buildings.</font>

383
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,660
<font color="yellow">Some saw some unidentifiable people throwing the money down from...</font>

384
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,590
<font color="yellow">Let's go for a walk.</font>

385
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,520
<font color="yellow">Sir, what brings you all the way here?</font>

386
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,790
<font color="yellow">I'm a citizen.</font>

387
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,720
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

388
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

389
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,390
<font color="yellow">People are watching.</font>

390
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,220
<font color="yellow">We should meet in a secure location.</font>

391
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,020
<font color="yellow">Can't people who don't pay taxes come to City Hall?</font>

392
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,460
<font color="yellow">Is that prohibited?</font>

393
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,920
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

394
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,590
<font color="yellow">Then there's no problem.</font>

395
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,890
<font color="yellow">I am a citizen...</font>

396
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,060
<font color="yellow">and I have a right to be here.</font>

397
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,490
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

398
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,120
<font color="yellow">He's coming in.</font>

399
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:54,144
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

400
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,690
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

401
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,020
<font color="yellow">I have people out there trying to collect what they can.</font>

402
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
<font color="yellow">I did not ask...</font>

403
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,290
<font color="yellow">what you are doing.</font>

404
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,490
<font color="yellow">I asked what you will do.</font>

405
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,820
<font color="yellow">Shall I tell you...</font>

406
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,520
<font color="yellow">what I think we should do?</font>

407
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,460
<font color="yellow">Cut off our tails.</font>

408
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,720
<font color="yellow">There are too many.</font>

409
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,790
<font color="yellow">On both you and me.</font>

410
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,260
<font color="yellow">Even if you collect the money,</font>

411
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,990
<font color="yellow">if you dig into where it came from,</font>

412
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,430
<font color="yellow">it'll lead back to me.</font>

413
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,220
<font color="yellow">People saw it.</font>

414
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,290
<font color="yellow">It wasn't just us.</font>

415
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,760
<font color="yellow">Pil Gyu.</font>

416
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
<font color="yellow">I'll drop him.</font>

417
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,020
<font color="yellow">- Mr Bang. We're from the police.
- His pyramid scheme...</font>

418
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,860
<font color="yellow">was illegal and corrupt.</font>

419
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,160
<font color="yellow">Those charges...</font>

420
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,520
<font color="yellow">should get him a pretty long stay behind bars.</font>

421
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,020
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about that?</font>

422
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,520
<font color="yellow">You are close.</font>

423
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,430
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

424
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,090
<font color="yellow">The older we get,</font>

425
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,190
<font color="yellow">the thicker our skin becomes.</font>

426
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,490
<font color="yellow">His kids...</font>

427
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
<font color="yellow">can join him, too.</font>

428
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,590
<font color="yellow">That...</font>

429
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,930
<font color="yellow">would look even better.</font>

430
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,990
<font color="yellow">- Wait!
- Come with us.</font>

431
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:40,360
<font color="yellow">That's the Woohyang connection gone for good.</font>

432
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,160
<font color="yellow">Next...</font>

433
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,360
<font color="yellow">are yours.</font>

434
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,190
<font color="yellow">You need to let a few people go.</font>

435
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,760
<font color="yellow">- Where are you from?
- Seowon Police Station.</font>

436
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,690
<font color="yellow">Baek Sung Il from Division One?</font>

437
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,760
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Do you know Prosecutor Han?</font>

438
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,590
<font color="yellow">- I don't.
- You need to come with us.</font>

439
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you handcuffing me?</font>

440
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,990
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

441
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,720
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Talk at the station.</font>

442
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,820
<font color="yellow">You can talk later.</font>

443
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,960
<font color="yellow">- What about?
- We'll ask the questions.</font>

444
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,260
<font color="yellow">- Commissioner.
- What's going on?</font>

445
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,960
<font color="yellow">Are you Commissioner Ahn Tae Wook?</font>

446
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,590
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

447
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,490
<font color="yellow">Did you ask Prosecutor Han...</font>

448
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,760
<font color="yellow">to release Detective Sa Jae Sung from prison?</font>

449
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,360
<font color="yellow">Through Mr Baek here.</font>

450
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,660
<font color="yellow">I never said that.</font>

451
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,260
<font color="yellow">- Explain yourself later.
- Let's go.</font>

452
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,090
<font color="yellow">You're making a mistake!</font>

453
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,260
<font color="yellow">- Be quiet and come along.
- Let me go!</font>

454
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,020
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me.
- We'll talk later.</font>

455
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,720
<font color="yellow">It would hurt...</font>

456
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,360
<font color="yellow">to lose two smart men.</font>

457
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,320
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

458
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,690
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped, though.</font>

459
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,990
<font color="yellow">We can't go down, can we?</font>

460
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,120
<font color="yellow">Commissioner Ahn.</font>

461
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,520
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

462
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,660
<font color="yellow">Did you do it?</font>

463
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,360
<font color="yellow">Was it you?</font>

464
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,690
<font color="yellow">Answer me!</font>

465
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,690
<font color="yellow">I will tell the cops everything.</font>

466
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
<font color="yellow">What you did until now, got it?</font>

467
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,190
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

468
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,430
<font color="yellow">Just wait.</font>

469
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,930
<font color="yellow">The next one is important.</font>

470
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,960
<font color="yellow">That punk, Baek Sung Il.</font>

471
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,090
<font color="yellow">What will you do about him?</font>

472
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,930
<font color="yellow">It looks to me that he is being used...</font>

473
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,760
<font color="yellow">by a con artist.</font>

474
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,390
