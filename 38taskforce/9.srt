00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,810
<font color="yellow">Honey, I think that...</font>

157
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,680
<font color="yellow">Ji Eun...</font>

158
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,880
<font color="yellow">She needs a new phone.</font>

159
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
<font color="yellow">Is he not answering?</font>

160
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,480
<font color="yellow">Is this the paint thinner?</font>

161
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,710
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

162
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,550
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Let's get back to work. Keep packing!</font>

163
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,450
<font color="yellow">What's not important to us could be important to kids.</font>

164
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,980
<font color="yellow">Kids get teased if they have an old phone.</font>

165
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,750
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

166
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,450
<font color="yellow">I'm near Majang-dong.</font>

167
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,620
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

168
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,680
<font color="yellow">Wangsimni? You're close by.</font>

169
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,510
<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

170
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,180
<font color="yellow">Throw the stuff away.</font>

171
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,950
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that?</font>

172
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,710
<font color="yellow">It took ages to collect.</font>

173
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,210
<font color="yellow">Jung Do.</font>

174
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,380
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll deal with it.</font>

175
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,810
<font color="yellow">Don't ask how. Leave it to me.</font>

176
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,050
<font color="yellow">He got out.</font>

177
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,110
<font color="yellow">I think it's time you head over here.</font>

178
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,610
<font color="yellow">Hang up. I'll be home late.</font>

179
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,310
<font color="yellow">(Yang Jung Do)</font>

180
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,010
<font color="yellow">I'm almost there.</font>

181
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,810
<font color="yellow">Don't come here.</font>

182
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,310
<font color="yellow">Don't come here.</font>

183
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,810
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

184
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,530
<font color="yellow">You're being tailed.</font>

185
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,780
<font color="yellow">Your commissioner followed you.</font>

186
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,180
<font color="yellow">He's bringing the cops.</font>

187
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,250
<font color="yellow">Are you listening?</font>

188
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,350
<font color="yellow">Sung Il. Shoot.</font>

189
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,010
<font color="yellow">Who's following you?</font>

190
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,880
<font color="yellow">He followed you all the way from City Hall.</font>

191
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,780
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

192
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,410
<font color="yellow">I'm a police officer.</font>

193
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,780
<font color="yellow">You know Detective Sa Jae Sung, don't you?</font>

194
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,730
<font color="yellow">He wants to see you.</font>

195
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,810
<font color="yellow">He locked me up once before.</font>

196
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,060
<font color="yellow">He had nothing on me, so I was let off.</font>

197
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,870
<font color="yellow">It won't take long. Don't worry. Come with me.</font>

198
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,410
<font color="yellow">Could you tell me why I should come with you?</font>

199
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,880
<font color="yellow">Shall I go after Hak Joo instead?</font>

200
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,180
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Let's go.</font>

201
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,710
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

202
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

203
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,050
<font color="yellow">Get in and drive home in peace.</font>

204
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,250
<font color="yellow">Don't follow people around.</font>

205
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,310
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

206
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,250
<font color="yellow">What's going on here?</font>

207
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,910
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

208
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,980
<font color="yellow">This is... Right.</font>

209
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,510
<font color="yellow">Still no answer?</font>

210
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,310
<font color="yellow">Did someone nab him?</font>

211
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,010
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

212
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,150
<font color="yellow">Why are things getting so complicated?</font>

213
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,110
<font color="yellow">I just don't understand.</font>

214
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,410
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring me here?</font>

215
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,050
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, I'm listening.</font>

216
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,250
<font color="yellow">How much do you know about Yang Jung Do?</font>

217
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,480
<font color="yellow">Stop letting him toy with you.</font>

218
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,810
<font color="yellow">You'll end up like me.</font>

219
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,650
<font color="yellow">Did you bring me here to say that?</font>

220
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,800
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the advice.</font>

221
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,910
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

222
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,350
<font color="yellow">Sit down, you moron.</font>

223
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,910
<font color="yellow">Baek Sung Il.</font>

224
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,710
<font color="yellow">Don't make me get to your team.</font>

225
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,210
<font color="yellow">Sit down and hear me out.</font>

226
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,250
<font color="yellow">Go on, then.</font>

227
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,950
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

228
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,780
<font color="yellow">Yang Jung Do...</font>

229
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,690
<font color="yellow">acted like a fool for years just so he could...</font>

230
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,110
<font color="yellow">put me behind bars.</font>

231
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,880
<font color="yellow">Just to put me here.</font>

232
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,150
<font color="yellow">He put money in a fake account in the name of my brother...</font>

233
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,650
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen in 20 years.</font>

234
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,550
<font color="yellow">Then he set me up...</font>

235
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,310
<font color="yellow">for taking a bribe.</font>

236
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,510
<font color="yellow">Did you do it properly?</font>

237
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,050
<font color="yellow">Don't make a mistake.</font>

238
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,850
<font color="yellow">Don't make a mistake on what?</font>

239
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

240
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,880
<font color="yellow">Nothing, really.</font>

241
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,580
<font color="yellow">It's just Ma Jin Seok.</font>

242
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,850
<font color="yellow">How did you two first meet?</font>

243
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,210
<font color="yellow">If you think back now, didn't anything seem strange?</font>

244
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,950
<font color="yellow">Can you make them pay by using the law?</font>

245
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,750
<font color="yellow">Leave it to me and I'll get you the six million.</font>

246
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,350
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have approached him and asked him...</font>

247
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,210
<font color="yellow">to con people into paying their taxes.</font>

248
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,080
<font color="yellow">I have a great idea.</font>

249
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,550
<font color="yellow">Are you interested?</font>

250
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,510
<font color="yellow">Do you think you met Jung Do by chance?</font>

251
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,550
<font color="yellow">Nothing happens by chance.</font>

252
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,210
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

253
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,750
<font color="yellow">Look where he put me.</font>

254
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,210
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

255
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,380
<font color="yellow">you're going after Bang Pil Gyu.</font>

256
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,110
<font color="yellow">Him and his 50 million dollars in back taxes.</font>

257
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,820
<font color="yellow">You want it.</font>

258
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,480
<font color="yellow">What will happen to you once the con's over?</font>

259
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,110
<font color="yellow">Let's be brutally honest.</font>

260
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,510
<font color="yellow">A con artist helping a public official gather taxes?</font>

261
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,210
<font color="yellow">It makes no sense.</font>

262
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,580
<font color="yellow">If Jung Do runs off with...</font>

263
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,280
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang's 50 million dollars, you'll have to take the blame.</font>

264
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,780
<font color="yellow">You are not working on a con...</font>

265
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,610
<font color="yellow">with Jung Do.</font>

266
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,110
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

267
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,880
<font color="yellow">being conned by him.</font>

268
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,320
<font color="yellow">He'll ditch you once he's done with you.</font>

269
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,710
<font color="yellow">It's time to switch sides.</font>

270
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,380
<font color="yellow">Isn't it?</font>

271
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,150
<font color="yellow">How did you two first meet?</font>

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,820
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about you, not us.</font>

313
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,490
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

314
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,820
<font color="yellow">We promised that I wouldn't get caught...</font>

315
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,250
<font color="yellow">and you wouldn't get fired, so let's keep that promise.</font>

316
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,250
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

317
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,190
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

318
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,550
<font color="yellow">I only want proof that Jung Do framed me.</font>

319
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,350
<font color="yellow">Find that...</font>

320
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,750
<font color="yellow">and give it to him.</font>

321
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,090
<font color="yellow">I'll take that...</font>

322
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,790
<font color="yellow">and make an appeal.</font>

323
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,550
<font color="yellow">Then I can get out.</font>

324
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,150
<font color="yellow">Once I'm out,</font>

325
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,990
<font color="yellow">I'll get Jung Do for you.</font>

326
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,550
<font color="yellow">He'll go to prison...</font>

327
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,950
<font color="yellow">and I'll be reinstated.</font>

328
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,620
<font color="yellow">You can...</font>

329
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,590
<font color="yellow">go back to your ordinary life...</font>

330
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,350
<font color="yellow">as if nothing had happened.</font>

331
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,150
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to take you for your word...</font>

332
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,090
<font color="yellow">and betray Jung Do?</font>

333
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,590
<font color="yellow">Why should I do that?</font>

334
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,390
<font color="yellow">Will you...</font>

335
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,020
<font color="yellow">believe Jung Do instead?</font>

336
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,190
<font color="yellow">He's a fraud.</font>

337
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,590
<font color="yellow">Sung Il.</font>

338
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,390
<font color="yellow">Forget about what I said.</font>

339
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,450
<font color="yellow">We're in this together.</font>

340
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,990
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

341
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,290
<font color="yellow">owe you a lot.</font>

342
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,550
<font color="yellow">You helped me out and I'm grateful.</font>

343
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,920
<font color="yellow">We're doing this for us, so don't worry.</font>

344
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,120
<font color="yellow">Jung Do.</font>

345
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,090
<font color="yellow">I'll do better.</font>

346
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,890
<font color="yellow">Let's do this.</font>

347
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,120
<font color="yellow">We're doing fine.</font>

348
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,290
<font color="yellow">You're doing fine.</font>

349
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,950
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

350
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,420
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Good morning.</font>

351
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,020
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Good morning.</font>

352
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,050
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

353
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,720
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

354
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,250
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

355
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,120
<font color="yellow">Can we talk?</font>

356
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,850
<font color="yellow">Talk here.</font>

357
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,290
<font color="yellow">It's not something we can discuss here.</font>

358
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,820
<font color="yellow">I know what you're going to say.</font>

359
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,220
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll deal with it.</font>

360
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,290
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

361
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,890
<font color="yellow">Get to work.</font>

362
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,320
<font color="yellow">I have to be somewhere.</font>

363
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,050
<font color="yellow">- See you later, Sir.
-  Okay.</font>

364
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,190
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

365
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

366
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,350
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

367
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,490
<font color="yellow">Have some coffee if you want.</font>

368
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,750
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Do you want some?</font>

369
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,690
<font color="yellow">Strong and black, no creamer.</font>

370
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,550
<font color="yellow">How much do you know?</font>

371
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,690
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  I'm asking if you know...</font>

372
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,420
<font color="yellow">what your chief is up to.</font>

373
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,690
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you mean.</font>

374
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,590
<font color="yellow">- You knew.
-  Pardon?</font>

375
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,870
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

376
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,420
<font color="yellow">Why are you shaking?</font>

377
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,690
<font color="yellow">- I don't know...
-  Are you part of it?</font>

378
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,290
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

379
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,890
<font color="yellow">Only then can I help you.</font>

380
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,920
<font color="yellow">The police are onto him. It'll be game over soon.</font>

381
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,980
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee.</font>

382
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,990
<font color="yellow">If you helped him con taxpayers into paying their taxes,</font>

383
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,810
<font color="yellow">then get out of it right now.</font>

384
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,950
<font color="yellow">You can't save Sung Il, but you can at least save yourself.</font>

385
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,350
<font color="yellow">- I don't understand...
-  You did understand.</font>

386
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,250
<font color="yellow">You got it very clearly.</font>

387
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
<font color="yellow">Or maybe not.</font>

388
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,750
<font color="yellow">I'm done talking. You can go.</font>

389
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,520
<font color="yellow">She's with him, too.</font>

390
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,020
<font color="yellow">What should I tell the mayor this time?</font>

391
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,650
<font color="yellow">This is what the Taxation Office looks like.</font>

392
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,050
<font color="yellow">I recognise a lot of you.</font>

393
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,890
<font color="yellow">I'm here for the public hearing.</font>

394
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,790

<font color="yellow">You must feel rotten.</font>

445

<font color="yellow">should be obliged to accept your feelings.</font>

446
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,290
<font color="yellow">That will only make you feel even worse.</font>

<font color="yellow">what you and my chief are up to.</font>

458
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,420
<font color="yellow">So, what you want to say is that...</font>

459
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,990
<font color="yellow">your commissioner could have tipped Bang Pil Gyu off?</font>

460
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,390
<font color="yellow">If that's the case,</font>

461
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,320
<font color="yellow">you really have to stop. That's what I'm here to say.</font>

462
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,490
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

463
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,290
<font color="yellow">I'll ask Bang Pil Gyu myself.</font>

464
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,420
<font color="yellow">I'll test him.</font>

465
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
<font color="yellow">See if he knows.</font>

466
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,260
<font color="yellow">You can't be so flippant about this.</font>

467
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,450
<font color="yellow">I'm not being flippant.</font>

468
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,530
<font color="yellow">There could be a problem. We're not yet sure if there is.</font>

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,620
<font color="yellow">Don't overreact.</font>

470
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,420
<font color="yellow">What if there is a problem and my chief gets hurt?</font>

471
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,550
<font color="yellow">Will you pay for it?</font>

472
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,350
<font color="yellow">That won't happen. Don't worry.</font>

473
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,150
<font color="yellow">It's easy for you to say.</font>

474
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,920
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any sense of responsibility?</font>

475
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,020
<font color="yellow">That day...</font>

476
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,790
<font color="yellow">and today, too.</font>

477
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,420
<font color="yellow">You say things so easily.</font>

478
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,450
<font color="yellow">That's why you hurt the people around you.</font>

479
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,150
<font color="yellow">I never said things so easily.</font>

480
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,990
<font color="yellow">To you, at least.</font>

481
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,890
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you something.</font>

482
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,690
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

483
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,890
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell me you're a conman?</font>

484
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,350
<font color="yellow">We could've broken up without you telling me.</font>

485
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,150
<font color="yellow">I know that nothing would have changed...</font>

486
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,420
<font color="yellow">if you left without telling me,</font>

487
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,990
<font color="yellow">but you didn't have to tell me.</font>

488
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,650
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

489
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,890
<font color="yellow">Get a caramel macchiato.</font>

490
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

491
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,450
<font color="yellow">With extra toppings.</font>

492
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,720
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what that is?</font>

493
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,720
<font color="yellow">- Topping!
-  Yes, Sir. Got it, Sir.</font>

494
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,120
<font color="yellow">That moron.</font>

495
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,090
<font color="yellow">If you...</font>

496
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,170
<font color="yellow">If you didn't tell me...</font>

497
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,190
<font color="yellow">- Still.
-  That was...</font>

498
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

499
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,490
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Bang.</font>

500
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,350
<font color="yellow">I thought it was you, Mr Cho.</font>

501
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,390
<font color="yellow">I came in to get coffee.</font>

502
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,890
<font color="yellow">Seoul is so small, isn't it?</font>

503
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Madam?</font>

504
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,390
<font color="yellow">I'm not a madam.</font>

505
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,620
<font color="yellow">Isn't she your wife?</font>

506
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,000
<font color="yellow">You said...</font>

507
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,720
<font color="yellow">you had a meeting with someone named Xun Ji Ha...</font>

508
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,520
<font color="yellow">and dinner with your wife.</font>

509
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,020
<font color="yellow">Pretend to be mad and leave.</font>

510
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,450
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

511
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,020
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

512
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,020
<font color="yellow">You're going to leave angry like this?</font>

513
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,020
<font color="yellow">Let it go.</font>

514
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,420
<font color="yellow">If you leave like this, you'll lock the bedroom door...</font>

515
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,020
<font color="yellow">and stay angry at me all day again.</font>

516
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,720
<font color="yellow">Like last time.</font>

517
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,920
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't eat and packed your bags...</font>

518
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,490
<font color="yellow">saying you were going to your parents' place...</font>

519
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,290
<font color="yellow">and made a big mess.</font>

520
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

521
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,690
<font color="yellow">cancel your appointment with Xun Ji Ha?</font>

522
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

523
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,620
<font color="yellow">I told you already.</font>

524
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
<font color="yellow">He...</font>

525
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,850
<font color="yellow">wanted to reschedule to tomorrow.</font>

526
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,020
<font color="yellow">How could he reschedule on the day of?</font>

527
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,920
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal?</font>

528
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,690
<font color="yellow">Xun Ji Ha wanted to invest.</font>

529
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,020
<font color="yellow">So? Who cares about a measly 100 million?</font>

530
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,590
<font color="yellow">To me, your word is more important.</font>

531
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,690
<font color="yellow">There are truckloads of people willing to invest as much.</font>

532
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,620
<font color="yellow">Was it...</font>

533
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,180
<font color="yellow">because of our appointment...</font>

534
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,590
<font color="yellow">Are you Mr Bang from UN Communications?</font>

535
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

536
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,850
<font color="yellow">Because of you,</font>

537
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,850
<font color="yellow">my husband lost 100 million dollars.</font>

538
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,790
<font color="yellow">What will you do about it?</font>

539
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,790
<font color="yellow">How... would... I...</font>

540
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,020
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

541
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,090
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

542
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,350
<font color="yellow">I don't know how great you are,</font>

543
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,990
<font color="yellow">but just know this.</font>

544
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,550
<font color="yellow">My husband...</font>

545
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,590
<font color="yellow">made plans with you tomorrow and lost a 100-million-dollar contract.</font>

546
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,620
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

547
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,590
<font color="yellow">So tomorrow night, make sure...</font>

548
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
<font color="yellow">to buy him a nice meal.</font>

549
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,420
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  Yes?</font>

550
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,520
<font color="yellow">Buy him something expensive and good.</font>

551
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,890
<font color="yellow">So that he'll forget all about the 100-million-dollar contract.</font>

552
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,120
<font color="yellow">Take him to one of those hot spots where you have to wait in line.</font>

553
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,320
<font color="yellow">I think that's what you should do.</font>

554
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,690
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at home.</font>

555
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,890
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell him to buy him a nice meal?</font>

556
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,090
<font color="yellow">Are you saying Jin Seok...</font>

557
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,290
<font color="yellow">was telling the truth?</font>

558
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,150
<font color="yellow">One of your men...</font>

559
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,950
<font color="yellow">is conning people...</font>

560
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,190
<font color="yellow">to get them to pay their taxes?</font>

561
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,050
<font color="yellow">I'm tailing him, so I'll be able to put an end to it soon.</font>

562
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:37,520
<font color="yellow">But I don't know who their target is after Ma Jin Seok.</font>

563
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,450
<font color="yellow">You never know,</font>

564
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,590
<font color="yellow">so you should be careful.</font>

565
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,990
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's Dad.</font>

566
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,020
<font color="yellow">Have you recently had...</font>

567
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,350
<font color="yellow">There's no one like that.</font>

568
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,190
<font color="yellow">Who gets conned in this day and age?</font>

569
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,590
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Your son is smart.</font>

570
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,070
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I have to go.</font>

571
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,290
<font color="yellow">I'm busy.</font>

572
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,220
<font color="yellow">I'll see you this weekend.</font>

573
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
<font color="yellow">I love you, Dad.</font>

574
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,890
<font color="yellow">What did your father say?</font>

575
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, well.</font>

576
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,820
<font color="yellow">He said to be careful of cons.</font>

577
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,290
<font color="yellow">Nothing much.</font>

578
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

579
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,950
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you lost 100 million dollars because of me.</font>

580
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,570
<font color="yellow">I feel terrible just thinking about it.</font>

581
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,920
<font color="yellow">I told you not to think about it.</font>

582
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,090
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

583
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,290
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang,</font>

584
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,120
<font color="yellow">money...</font>

585
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,920
<font color="yellow">all look the same.</font>

586
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,420
<font color="yellow">I may lose 100 million here,</font>

587
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,020
<font color="yellow">but I can make 100 million there.</font>

588
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,420
<font color="yellow">But no two people...</font>

589
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,820
<font color="yellow">look the same.</font>

590
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,790
<font color="yellow">There's only one in the world.</font>

591
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,050
<font color="yellow">That's what people are.</font>

592
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,920
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for saying that,</font>

593
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,290
<font color="yellow">but I feel so bad. I'd like to compensate you somehow.</font>

594
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,050
<font color="yellow">It's okay. There's no need.</font>

595
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,550
<font color="yellow">You know what,</font>

596
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,800
<font color="yellow">what if I invested a little in your company?</font>

597
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,820
<font color="yellow">Invest?</font>

598
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,850
<font color="yellow">No, there's no need.</font>

599
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,290
<font color="yellow">There are plenty of people who want to invest...</font>

600
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,550
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

601
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,120
<font color="yellow">I'm doing it for myself, not to help you.</font>

602
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,820
<font color="yellow">You said investors make 500 percent of their investments.</font>

603
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,290
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

604
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,000
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

605
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,720
<font color="yellow">I'd like to keep our relationship...</font>

606
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,820
<font color="yellow">nice and friendly like it is now.</font>

607
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,820
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

608
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,200
<font color="yellow">I won't put in that much money, so don't feel bad.</font>

609
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,220
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about it tomorrow.</font>

610
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,250
<font color="yellow">My wife is waiting.</font>

611
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
<font color="yellow">I'll call you.</font>

612
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll see you.</font>

613
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,950
<font color="yellow">That's not good.</font>

614
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,690
<font color="yellow">We should remain friends.</font>

615
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,650
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho.</font>

616
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,450
<font color="yellow">Why don't we make it...</font>

617
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,120
<font color="yellow">a double date tomorrow?</font>

618
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,190
<font color="yellow">Stop letting him toy with you.</font>

619
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,220
<font color="yellow">You'll end up like me.</font>

620
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,230
<font color="yellow">Stop letting him toy with you.</font>

621
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,300
<font color="yellow">You'll end up like me.</font>

622
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,730
<font color="yellow">The neighbourhood hasn't changed.</font>

623
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,260
<font color="yellow">I needed to talk to you,</font>

624
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,560
<font color="yellow">but I didn't have your number.</font>

625
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,680
<font color="yellow">I couldn't reach Mi Joo...</font>

626
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,160
<font color="yellow">and I felt weird asking Mr Baek.</font>

627
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,330
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Mr Baek what happened earlier.</font>

628
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,800
<font color="yellow">I won't. That's why I came here instead of calling.</font>

629
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,530
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

630
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,000
<font color="yellow">It's funny.</font>

631
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,700
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell him to buy me a nice meal?</font>

632
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,200
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's funny?</font>

633
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,300
<font color="yellow">You would've been in trouble if it weren't for me.</font>

634
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,800
<font color="yellow">I told you to get angry and leave. Why did you keep talking?</font>

635
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,500
<font color="yellow">How could I just get angry?</font>

636
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,060
<font color="yellow">What? Curse at you and leave? That's ridiculous.</font>

637
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,430
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

638
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,130
<font color="yellow">I'm too tired to talk.</font>

639
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,360
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, say it and go.</font>

640
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,860
<font color="yellow">You need to eat with me.</font>

641
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,830
<font color="yellow">You should've refused.</font>

642
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,960
<font color="yellow">I did. I kept refusing,</font>

643
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,430
<font color="yellow">but he kept begging, saying he wanted to apologise to you.</font>

644
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,630
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to say all that and create this mess?</font>

645
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,030
<font color="yellow">Why should I go there? I won't go.</font>

646
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,880
<font color="yellow">You take care of it.</font>

647
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,900
<font color="yellow">I'd like to take care of it.</font>

648
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,530
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

649
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,900
<font color="yellow">Tell him I died.</font>

650
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,260
<font color="yellow">Don't get me involved.</font>

651
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,930
<font color="yellow">I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable either.</font>

652
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,280
<font color="yellow">You should've flat out refused. That's what you should've done.</font>

653
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,860
<font color="yellow">I did. I flat out refused. I did.</font>

654
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,790
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I told you, so bye.</font>

655
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,900
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

656
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,400
<font color="yellow">I'm not going. I gave you my answer.</font>

657
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,200
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

658
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,630
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

659
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,060
<font color="yellow">I heard the daughter is on the move. We should get moving too.</font>

660
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

661
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,300
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

662
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,030
<font color="yellow">We laid the foundation well.</font>

663
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,860
<font color="yellow">I think we can finish the job relatively simply,</font>

664
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,430
<font color="yellow">so please keep it up.</font>

665
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,830
<font color="yellow">Ms Noh, please go back to the antique shop...</font>

666
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,230
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

667
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,460
<font color="yellow">Give me the most expensive celadon you have.</font>

668
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

669
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,900
<font color="yellow">Get us a really nice celadon.</font>

670
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,560
<font color="yellow">As for the two of you, please get a bunch of items...</font>

671
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,930
<font color="yellow">that look like antiques. They can be cheap.</font>

672
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:13,990
<font color="yellow">We'll take them all.</font>

673
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,100
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

674
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,660
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

675
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,630
<font color="yellow">And then what? What will you do?</font>

676
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,800
<font color="yellow">She's only heard of what kind of people we are.</font>

677
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,900
<font color="yellow">Now, we'll show her.</font>

678
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,530
<font color="yellow">(Cultural Heritage Administration)</font>

679
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,760
<font color="yellow">She collects antiques to avoid paying taxes,</font>

680
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,430
<font color="yellow">so we should show her that we are just as dirty,</font>

681
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,530
<font color="yellow">and that we will do anything...</font>

682
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,800
<font color="yellow">and everything...</font>

683
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,700
<font color="yellow">to make money.</font>

684
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,830
<font color="yellow">People need to see it to believe it.</font>

685
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,160
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

686
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,960
<font color="yellow">Don't mind me.</font>

687
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,860
<font color="yellow">Go about your business.</font>

688
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,630
<font color="yellow">You'll show her...</font>

689
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,730
<font color="yellow">and then what?</font>

690
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,930
<font color="yellow">We'll become friends.</font>

691
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,000
<font color="yellow">If Jung Do runs off with...</font>

692
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,630
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang's 50 million dollars, you'll have to take the blame.</font>

693
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,330
<font color="yellow">He'll ditch you once he's done with you.</font>

694
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,460
<font color="yellow">It's time to switch sides.</font>

695
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,860
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

696
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,470
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

697
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,200
<font color="yellow">You should be smarter about whom to take on.</font>

698
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:32,660
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

699
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,430
<font color="yellow">Don't confuse pity with authority.</font>

700
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,360
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by.</font>

701
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

702
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,630
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

703
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,830
<font color="yellow">You should apologise for bumping into an elder.</font>

704
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,360
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

705
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,800
<font color="yellow">Did you want to say something?</font>

706
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,260
<font color="yellow">Next time.</font>

707
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,860
<font color="yellow">No, not really.</font>

708
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,860
<font color="yellow">Has there been any suspicious people around you lately?</font>

709
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,460
<font color="yellow">Like who?</font>

710
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,630
<font color="yellow">Never mind. As long as there aren't any.</font>

711
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,730
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

712
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,730
<font color="yellow">So, you didn't do it?</font>

713
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,330
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

714
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,900
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim called earlier.</font>

715
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,330
<font color="yellow">We should start preparing a contingency plan.</font>

716
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,260
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

717
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,100
<font color="yellow">We should be true to who we are.</font>

718
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,730
<font color="yellow">We're con artists.</font>

719
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,330
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came.</font>

720
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,130
<font color="yellow">I'm more trustworthy...</font>

721
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,400
<font color="yellow">than Jung Do, aren't I?</font>

722
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,260
<font color="yellow">I work for the government,</font>

723
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,200
<font color="yellow">after all.</font>

724
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,430
<font color="yellow">How much do you know...</font>

725
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,330
<font color="yellow">about Yang Jung Do?</font>

726
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,560
<font color="yellow">What will happen to you once the con's over?</font>

727
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,160
<font color="yellow">Let's be brutally honest.</font>

728
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,430
<font color="yellow">A con artist helping a public official gather taxes?</font>

729
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,160
<font color="yellow">It makes no sense.</font>

730
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

731
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,230
<font color="yellow">We promised that I wouldn't get caught...</font>

732
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,760
<font color="yellow">and you wouldn't get fired, so let's keep that promise.</font>

733
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

734
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

735
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,760
<font color="yellow">You're dropping in late often now.</font>

736
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,930
<font color="yellow">Well, I was just passing by.</font>

737
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,330
<font color="yellow">May I come in?</font>

738
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,300
<font color="yellow">If I say no, will you just leave? Come in.</font>

739
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,200
<font color="yellow">I heard you had to bail because you ran into Bang Pil Gyu.</font>

740
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,630
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he didn't recognise you?</font>

741
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,230
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think he remembered me.</font>

742
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,560
<font color="yellow">Thankfully.</font>

743
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

744
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,100
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

745
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,700
<font color="yellow">Well, Jung Do...</font>

746
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,760
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the detective that we got locked up...</font>

747
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,600
<font color="yellow">when we ran the con on Ma Jin Seok?</font>

748
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,530
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

749
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:03,730
<font color="yellow">Did you know he's in prison...</font>

750
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,330
<font color="yellow">for taking bribes?</font>

751
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,960
<font color="yellow">He...</font>

752
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,700
<font color="yellow">gave me this.</font>

753
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,630
<font color="yellow">He says...</font>

754
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,660
<font color="yellow">that...</font>

755
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,000
<font color="yellow">you're using me,</font>

756
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,800
<font color="yellow">and that you'll ditch me once you're done with me,</font>

757
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,530
<font color="yellow">so if I'd bring a recording of you saying you framed him,</font>

758
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,560
<font color="yellow">he'd take care of it.</font>

759
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,160
<font color="yellow">So he gave me that.</font>

760
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me that?</font>

761
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,830
<font color="yellow">It's not like I believe him,</font>

762
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,740
<font color="yellow">but I thought I should tell you...</font>

763
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,230
<font color="yellow">and confirm for myself.</font>

764
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,260
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

765
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,660
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

766
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,000
<font color="yellow">That detective is right.</font>

767
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,130
<font color="yellow">I'm using you.</font>

768
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,530
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

769
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,830
<font color="yellow">(Squad 38)</font>

770
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,350
<font color="yellow">This is it.</font>

771
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:02,460
<font color="yellow">The antique appraiser, the only person Bang Min A trusts.</font>

772
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,060

775
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:11,560

-  Three times?</font>

778
