00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,430
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

158
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,270
<font color="yellow">People like them come to us...</font>

159
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,870
<font color="yellow">because they have no one else to talk to.</font>

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,100
<font color="yellow">They have a lot to say but no one to talk to.</font>

161
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,800
<font color="yellow">That's why they come to us.</font>

162
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,130
<font color="yellow">Can't you hear him out?</font>

163
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,300
<font color="yellow">It's not that hard to just listen.</font>

164
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,470
<font color="yellow">To be frank,</font>

165
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,170
<font color="yellow">if that old man were to end up like Sang Ho,</font>

166
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,400
<font color="yellow">how would you feel then?</font>

167
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,570
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,600
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

169
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

170
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,570
<font color="yellow">What happens to him is none of my business.</font>

171
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,230
<font color="yellow">Why should I care...</font>

172
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
<font color="yellow">what happens to him?</font>

173
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,730
<font color="yellow">We aren't related.</font>

174
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,570
<font color="yellow">Are we?</font>

175
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,000
<font color="yellow">What happened to you, Sir?</font>

176
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,800
<font color="yellow">Nothing's happened.</font>

177
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,270
<font color="yellow">This is who I am.</font>

178
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,050
<font color="yellow">Don't call me sir.</font>

179
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,700
<font color="yellow">I'm on the management support team. I'm no longer your chief.</font>

180
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,270
<font color="yellow">Am I?</font>

181
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,400
<font color="yellow">You're the chief now.</font>

182
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,600
<font color="yellow">Shall we talk outside?</font>

183
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,230
<font color="yellow">It's a hot day.</font>

184
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,670
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

185
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,230
<font color="yellow">that Baek Sung Il guy.</font>

186
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,530
<font color="yellow">What is he up to these days?</font>

187
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,870
<font color="yellow">I'm getting regular updates.</font>

188
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,270
<font color="yellow">You won't have to worry about him.</font>

189
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,100
<font color="yellow">He's quiet and gets into no trouble.</font>

190
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,230
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

191
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,470
<font color="yellow">Mr Mayor.</font>

192
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,830
<font color="yellow">Redeveloping the Maseok-dong plot.</font>

193
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,530
<font color="yellow">Do you hate the idea that much?</font>

194
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,370
<font color="yellow">It's the area...</font>

195
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,970
<font color="yellow">that pays the least amount of taxes.</font>

196
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,800
<font color="yellow">Maseok-dong.</font>

197
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,070
<font color="yellow">The poorest area in Seowon City.</font>

198
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,300
<font color="yellow">That explains why all the landowners dress so poorly.</font>

199
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,400
<font color="yellow">You can tell right away that it's a run-down neighbourhood.</font>

200
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,800
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why...</font>

201
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,300
<font color="yellow">you sold it to me for almost nothing?</font>

202
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,200
<font color="yellow">All the buildings there.</font>

203
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,900
<font color="yellow">The landlords and landladies aren't the problem.</font>

204
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,030
<font color="yellow">It's the tenants.</font>

205
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,430
<font color="yellow">If we remove them by force, they will become homeless.</font>

206
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,400
<font color="yellow">I can't give up on my right just for your pity.</font>

207
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,170
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

208
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,800
<font color="yellow">exercise my right.</font>

209
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,670
<font color="yellow">Did I not compensate them?</font>

210
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,630
<font color="yellow">Did I not give them time?</font>

211
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,070
<font color="yellow">I gave them both.</font>

212
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,570
<font color="yellow">I did what the law requires of me.</font>

213
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,200
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

214
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about the law.</font>

215
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,200
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about human rights.</font>

216
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,410
<font color="yellow">Following the law doesn't justify violence.</font>

217
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,470
<font color="yellow">Can you be responsible...</font>

218
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,270
<font color="yellow">for what you said?</font>

219
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,670
<font color="yellow">I can't believe a mayor gunning for a second term just said that.</font>

220
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,900
<font color="yellow">Did you just reject the law?</font>

221
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,570
<font color="yellow">- Did you?
-  No.</font>

222
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,570
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

223
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,670
<font color="yellow">I followed the law until now,</font>

224
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,070
<font color="yellow">and I plan to continue to do so.</font>

225
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,600
<font color="yellow">If you don't like what I'm doing,</font>

226
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,130
<font color="yellow">take action according to the law.</font>

227
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
<font color="yellow">The few who are still squatting there...</font>

228
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,070
<font color="yellow">will be dragged out.</font>

229
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,600
<font color="yellow">The buildings will be demolished.</font>

230
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,430
<font color="yellow">That's why I wanted to see you.</font>

231
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,370
<font color="yellow">You can go. I'm done talking.</font>

232
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,170
<font color="yellow">Mr Cha.</font>

233
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,830
<font color="yellow">- It's me.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

234
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,760
<font color="yellow">Of course, Sir. We'll do that.</font>

235
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,030
<font color="yellow">Sure. Bye.</font>

236
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,670
<font color="yellow">I hate this part.</font>

237
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

238
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,970
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

239
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,130
<font color="yellow">Old man.</font>

240
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,100
<font color="yellow">It's like I said. What you're doing is illegal.</font>

241
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,670
<font color="yellow">You had a deadline.</font>

242
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,210
<font color="yellow">Didn't you?</font>

243
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,670
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much we're losing because of you?</font>

244
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,470
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

245
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,070
<font color="yellow">now we have to do what the law tells us to.</font>

246
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,170
<font color="yellow">We're doing this for a living, too.</font>

247
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,970
<font color="yellow">That was good.</font>

248
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,170
<font color="yellow">Five dollars, right?</font>

249
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,700
<font color="yellow">You do pretty well.</font>

250
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,300
<font color="yellow">You do well enough...</font>

251
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,700
<font color="yellow">without having to redevelop this area.</font>

252
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,570
<font color="yellow">We'll die.</font>

253
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,830
<font color="yellow">We'll starve if we lose what we have here!</font>

254
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,930
<font color="yellow">Stop whining.</font>

255
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,030
<font color="yellow">Just die, then.</font>

256
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,130
<font color="yellow">I hate old people.</font>

257
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,770
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

258
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,770
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

259
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,300
<font color="yellow">Bye, old man.</font>

260
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,030
<font color="yellow">Don't!</font>

261
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out of here!</font>

262
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,500
<font color="yellow">- Stop it!
-  Get out!</font>

263
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
<font color="yellow">Get lost!</font>

264
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,400
<font color="yellow">Jung Do's getting released?</font>

265
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,800
<font color="yellow">So soon?</font>

266
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,300
<font color="yellow">He got 10 years.</font>

267
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,070
<font color="yellow">He'll be paroled.</font>

268
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

269
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,170
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details.</font>

270
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,770
<font color="yellow">He's getting released.</font>

271
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,000
<font color="yellow">I think he'll be out next week.</font>

272
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,370
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

273
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,000
<font color="yellow">How can a 10-year sentence become 2?</font>

274
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,240
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

275
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,430
<font color="yellow">It can't be so you could tell me that.</font>

276
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,270
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

277
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,740
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask you a favour.</font>

278
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,300
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

279
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,530
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

280
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,530
<font color="yellow">The people you worked with.</font>

281
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,300
<font color="yellow">Are you still in touch with them?</font>

282
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,870
<font color="yellow">You need to do something as soon as Jung Do gets out.</font>

283
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,070
<font color="yellow">You'll need their help to do it.</font>

284
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,270
<font color="yellow">Will they do it?</font>

285
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,150
<font color="yellow">They fell for his sweet talk and played along,</font>

286
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,240
<font color="yellow">but that was two years ago.</font>

287
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,370
<font color="yellow">It's different now.</font>

288
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,130
<font color="yellow">They're frauds.</font>

289
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,130
<font color="yellow">They won't do anything that's not for profit.</font>

290
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

291
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,100
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to them. I'll try,</font>

292
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,470
<font color="yellow">but don't expect too much.</font>

293
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,240
<font color="yellow">Even I'm not that interested myself.</font>

294
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,630
<font color="yellow">I'll try talking to them.</font>

295
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,430
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

296
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,130
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

297
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,170
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

298
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,500
<font color="yellow">What's Sung Il up to?</font>

299
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,130
<font color="yellow">Things happened along the way.</font>

300
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,530
<font color="yellow">- Here, take a bottle each.
-  Thanks.</font>

301
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,660
<font color="yellow">- Drink this.
-  Thanks.</font>

302
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,050
<font color="yellow">What's this for?</font>

303
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,800
<font color="yellow">It's a pick-me-up.</font>

304
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,270
<font color="yellow">- Here.
-  Thanks so much.</font>

305
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,550
<font color="yellow">Have one yourself, Mr Shim.</font>

306
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,700
<font color="yellow">You must be tired...</font>

307
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,930
<font color="yellow">from working away from the office these days.</font>

308
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,430
<font color="yellow">I'll massage your shoulders. I'm good at that.</font>

309
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,570
<font color="yellow">- Just a bit.
-  Forget it.</font>

310
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,270
<font color="yellow">I said forget it. Go and work instead.</font>

311
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,070
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

312
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,240
<font color="yellow">Are these empty?

<font color="yellow">The mayor of Seowon City...</font>

472
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,750
<font color="yellow">was assaulted by the public this afternoon.</font>

473
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,620
<font color="yellow">He was in Maseok-dong to attend a discussion...</font>

<font color="yellow">and threw an egg at the mayor.</font>

482
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,670
<font color="yellow">The mayor didn't seem to mind it much,</font>

483
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,250
<font color="yellow">but he left the scene in a hurry.</font>

484
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,250

496
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,120

497
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,650

613
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,710
<font color="yellow">That's right. He doesn't use the money from Pyeong-dong...</font>

614
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,450
<font color="yellow">to invest in other businesses.</font>

615
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,340
<font color="yellow">So he won't let dirty money...</font>

<font color="yellow">mix with clean money.</font>

617
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,390

622
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,880
<font color="yellow">This was originally Woohyang Construction.</font>

623

<font color="yellow">Hello. We're here from Seowon City Hall.</font>

627
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,250
<font color="yellow">May we see Mr Cha Myung Soo?</font>

628
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,620
<font color="yellow">They've already cut all ties to Choi Chul Woo.</font>

629
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,750
<font color="yellow">Seeing how he was willing to burn Woohyang Construction and...</font>

630
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,450
<font color="yellow">Woohyang Tech but he wanted to save Kukjin Construction...</font>

631
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,170
<font color="yellow">It is clearly important to him.</font>

632
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,750
<font color="yellow">It was quiet for several years,</font>

633
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,980
<font color="yellow">but it became active recently.</font>

634
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,820
<font color="yellow">So Kukjin has the development rights to Maseok-dong, is that it?</font>

635
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,750
<font color="yellow">Who's the puppet president?</font>

636
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
<font color="yellow">- Cha Myung Soo.
-  Cha Myung Soo...</font>

637
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,770
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hi.</font>

638
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,980
<font color="yellow">If Bang Pil Gyu is Choi Chul Woo's right-hand man,</font>

639
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,930
<font color="yellow">he's his left-hand man.</font>

640
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,780
<font color="yellow">He seems to have fudged some numbers...</font>

641
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,950
<font color="yellow">and embezzled some company funds, but it wasn't that much.</font>

642
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,790
<font color="yellow">I think that's why Choi Chul Woo is letting it slide.</font>

643
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,450
<font color="yellow">Only 100,000 a year?</font>

644
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,450
<font color="yellow">He must be very afraid of Choi Chul Woo.</font>

645
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

646
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,950
<font color="yellow">He's terrified.</font>

647
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,450
<font color="yellow">I think that's why he gave this man Kukjin Construction.</font>

648
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,420
<font color="yellow">Scared men don't betray their masters.</font>

649
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,480
<font color="yellow">He probably has a lot pent up, though.</font>

650
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,620
<font color="yellow">Everyone has a temper.</font>

651
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,350
<font color="yellow">Why must I put up with this?</font>

652
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,580
<font color="yellow">Jung Do, isn't this the man you conned before?</font>

653
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,850
<font color="yellow">That's right. Cho Sang Jin.</font>

654
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,080
<font color="yellow">He handles Kukjin's finances.</font>

655
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,320
<font color="yellow">He went to schools with Cha Myung Soo.</font>

656
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,110
<font color="yellow">You have such a sense of style.</font>

657
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,450
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>

658
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,350
<font color="yellow">His accounting office must not have done well.</font>

659
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,620
<font color="yellow">Is this it?</font>

660
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,980
<font color="yellow">That is pretty much Choi Chul Woo's source of funds.</font>

661
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,820
<font color="yellow">But there's something you need to know.</font>

662
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,220
<font color="yellow">Do you remember...</font>

663
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,850
<font color="yellow">Commissioner Ahn Tae Wook, my boss from two years ago?</font>

664
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,420
<font color="yellow">He is now a director at Kukjin Construction.</font>

665
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,100
<font color="yellow">He's very quick,</font>

666
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,280
<font color="yellow">so you should be very careful when you do your job.</font>

667
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,680
<font color="yellow">It doesn't hurt to be careful.</font>

668
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,620
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll keep that in mind.</font>

669
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,150
<font color="yellow">I think this...</font>

670
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,280
<font color="yellow">is all I can do for you.</font>

671
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,280
<font color="yellow">You can do the rest when you get out.</font>

672
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,970
<font color="yellow">But... But doesn't it feel...</font>

673
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,250
<font color="yellow">like something's missing?</font>

674
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,350
<font color="yellow">Right? It feels like something's missing.</font>

675
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,630
<font color="yellow">You feel that way too, right?</font>

676
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,150
<font color="yellow">What? What's missing?</font>

677
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,220
<font color="yellow">Well, since a person who was always around isn't here...</font>

678
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,780
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that man, Baek Sung Il?</font>

679
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,110
<font color="yellow">I think this...</font>

680
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,170
<font color="yellow">is all I can do for you.</font>

681
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,970
<font color="yellow">You can do the rest when you get out.</font>

682
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,830

683
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,140
<font color="yellow">like something's missing?</font>

684
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,370
<font color="yellow">Right? It feels like something's missing.</font>

685
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,420
<font color="yellow">You feel that way too, right?</font>

686
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,010
<font color="yellow">What? What's missing?</font>

687
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,170
<font color="yellow">Well, since a person who was always around isn't here...</font>

688
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,640
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that man, Baek Sung Il?</font>

689
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,880
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

690
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,740
<font color="yellow">- Have a nice day.
-  Don't stay too late.</font>

691
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,740
<font color="yellow">Okay. Have a nice day.</font>

692
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,570
<font color="yellow">He's back to being a loser.</font>

693
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,570
<font color="yellow">He's all watered down.</font>

694
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,440
<font color="yellow">I hear that's how he's living now...</font>

695
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,020
<font color="yellow">to fool the City Hall people.</font>

696
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,370
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek has changed.</font>

697
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,210
<font color="yellow">He's back to his old self.</font>

698
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,540
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

699
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,610
<font color="yellow">The right way to phrase it is...</font>

700
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,340
<font color="yellow">he'll change. He has to.</font>

701
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,240
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

702
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,570
<font color="yellow">There are many eyes in City Hall.</font>

703
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,210
<font color="yellow">He needs to fool them.</font>

704
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,090
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I'll do it myself.</font>

705
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,410
<font color="yellow">There isn't a single thing you can do properly.</font>

706
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,940
<font color="yellow">I'm swamped right now. I'm sorry.</font>

707
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,570
<font color="yellow">That way, when you get out,</font>

708
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,910
<font color="yellow">he can work with you.</font>

709
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,810
<font color="yellow">- No, Sir.
-  Okay.</font>

710

<font color="yellow">Your granddaughter should be home soon.</font>

713
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,540

<font color="yellow">This is who I really am.</font>

716
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,910

<font color="yellow">Think of it as a little break...</font>

744
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,010
<font color="yellow">and stay in there for a short while.</font>

745

<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

746
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,870

00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,210
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

771
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,510
<font color="yellow">We should look at the person, rather than the tax.</font>

<font color="yellow">You'll pull down the jerks...</font>

00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:28,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim!</font>

780
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,670
<font color="yellow">Where's Mr Kim?</font>

781
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,710
<font color="yellow">I think he went to the restroom.</font>

782
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:33,940
<font color="yellow">Does he still smoke?</font>

783
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,410
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

784
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,930
<font color="yellow">Welcome back.</font>

785
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:48,940
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

786
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,370
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

787
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,040
<font color="yellow">You look down.</font>

788
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,910
<font color="yellow">- Did something happen?
-  No.</font>

789
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,670
<font color="yellow">I went to see Da Mi's Diner earlier. That's why.</font>

790
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,610
<font color="yellow">It's so good to see you again.</font>

791
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,610
<font color="yellow">I should buy you something good to eat, instead of coming here.</font>

792
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,940
<font color="yellow">I was craving soju so badly.</font>

793
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,340
<font color="yellow">This is better.</font>

794
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,910
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

795
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,540
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much about Da Mi's Diner.</font>

796
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,370
<font color="yellow">I'll pull the plug on the Maseok-dong development...</font>

797
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,010
<font color="yellow">and save the restaurant...</font>

798
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,270
<font color="yellow">by destroying Kukjin Construction.</font>

799
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,040
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's do that.</font>

800
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,570
<font color="yellow">What will you do about Mayor Chun?</font>

801
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,940
<font color="yellow">We won't mark him.</font>

802
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,040
<font color="yellow">He knows us too well.</font>

803
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,870
<font color="yellow">Then who will?</font>

804
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,370
<font color="yellow">Chairman Wang.</font>

805
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:16,970
<font color="yellow">Chairman Wang?</font>

806
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,640
<font color="yellow">Welcome back.</font>

807
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,440
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

808
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:43,570
<font color="yellow">It's only natural that you go to prison if you commit a crime.</font>

809
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,810
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Mr Fourth Offence?</font>

810
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,670
<font color="yellow">Why aren't there any reporters?</font>

811
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,740
<font color="yellow">We thought the chairman would be uncomfortable.</font>

812
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,710
<font color="yellow">We told them we'd hold a separate press conference.</font>

813
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,770
<font color="yellow">Good thinking.</font>

814
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,210
<font color="yellow">A rich bad man getting released from prison doesn't deserve fanfare.</font>

815
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,410
<font color="yellow">Even this is too much.</font>

816
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,040
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring so many of the kids?</font>

817
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,810
<font color="yellow">You could've just sent a bus ticket.</font>

818
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,620
<font color="yellow">Stop saying things you don't mean. Where should we take you first?</font>

819
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,840
<font color="yellow">- Would you like to go home...
-  No.</font>

820
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,070
<font color="yellow">Not home.</font>

821
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,440
<font color="yellow">Then where?</font>

822
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,640
<font color="yellow">Yang Jung Do.</font>

823
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,110
<font color="yellow">Where is he right now?</font>

824
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,410
<font color="yellow">(Squad 38)</font>

825
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,970
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun wants to meet the chairman.</font>

826
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,060
<font color="yellow">He gave a lot of money to our city.</font>

827
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,640
<font color="yellow">Get me an appointment.</font>

828
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,670
<font color="yellow">I'm Yang Jung Do.</font>

829
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,440
<font color="yellow">Your 100 million in back taxes...</font>

830
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,630
<font color="yellow">Is there anything I can do to help?</font>

831
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,440
<font color="yellow">20 million? Loan scams?</font>

832
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,040
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to betray the chairman?</font>

833
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,710
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

834
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,710
<font color="yellow">No one loves the country more than me.</font>

835
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:10,970
<font color="yellow">Are you threatening me?</font>

836
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,310
<font color="yellow">Look at the world with naive eyes, but don't be naive in life.</font>

837
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,410
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to survive.</font>
