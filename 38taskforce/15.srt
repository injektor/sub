<font color="yellow">Remember one thing, though.</font>

159
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,570
<font color="yellow">I don't bet on a losing game.</font>

160
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,740
<font color="yellow">Now that you involved me,</font>

161
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,940
<font color="yellow">do your very best to make it work.</font>

162
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,540
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

163
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,410
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll remember that.</font>

164
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,970
<font color="yellow">What will you do about the spy?</font>

165
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,440
<font color="yellow">Will you keep it?</font>

166
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,040
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

167
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,570
<font color="yellow">Will you follow my suggestion?</font>

168
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,970
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

169
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,340
<font color="yellow">If we're going to do it,</font>

170
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,710
<font color="yellow">we might as well be open.</font>

171
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,410
<font color="yellow">That's so typically you.</font>

172
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,610
<font color="yellow">Call everyone to the warehouse.</font>

173
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,710
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

174
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,070
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- Shall we play?</font>

175
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,470
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Hak Joo.</font>

176
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,040
<font color="yellow">- How about a game of cards?
- No way.</font>

177
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,970
<font color="yellow">He always wants to play.</font>

178
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,370
<font color="yellow">I'm bored.</font>

179
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,270
<font color="yellow">I called you all here...</font>

180
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,710
<font color="yellow">- to say something.
- I'm serious.</font>

181
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,940
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- See this?</font>

182
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,770
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, all of you.</font>

183
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,040
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms Noh.</font>

184
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,170
<font color="yellow">I called you because...</font>

185
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,540
<font color="yellow">one of you...</font>

186
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,140
<font color="yellow">betrayed us.</font>

187
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,740
<font color="yellow">This person gave the prosecutors information about me two years ago.</font>

188
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,970
<font color="yellow">This is just a guess,</font>

189
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,840
<font color="yellow">but that person could have told...</font>

190
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,140
<font color="yellow">Choi Chul Woo all our plans.</font>

191
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,210
<font color="yellow">If that's true,</font>

192
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,310
<font color="yellow">we're done for.</font>

193
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,470
<font color="yellow">Who is the vermin? Who did it?</font>

194
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,070
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

195
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,470
<font color="yellow">That's why you're all here.</font>

196
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,310
<font color="yellow">I don't know who it is,</font>

197
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,310
<font color="yellow">but remember one thing.</font>

198
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,240
<font color="yellow">Two years ago, I took the fall.</font>

199
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,040
<font color="yellow">Not this time.</font>

200
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,540
<font color="yellow">If this con sinks,</font>

201
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,210
<font color="yellow">too many will suffer.</font>

202
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,040
<font color="yellow">That includes us all.</font>

203
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,840
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee who went out on a limb to help us.</font>

204
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,670
<font color="yellow">Da Mi and her grandfather who put their hope in us.</font>

205
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,740
<font color="yellow">In a way,</font>

206
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,040
<font color="yellow">that includes the people who are fighting for Maseok-dong.</font>

207
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,510
<font color="yellow">They'll all get hurt...</font>

208
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,240
<font color="yellow">if this con doesn't work out.</font>

209
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,070
<font color="yellow">If you did this...</font>

210
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,840
<font color="yellow">because you hated me and wanted revenge for something,</font>

211
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,370
<font color="yellow">please hold back this once.</font>

212
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,140
<font color="yellow">Someone told me I shouldn't play with one's heart.</font>

213
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,040
<font color="yellow">If you do that...</font>

214
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,610
<font color="yellow">The other person gets hurt...</font>

215
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,440
<font color="yellow">and you become lonely.</font>

216
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,670
<font color="yellow">I can deal with loneliness.</font>

217
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,410
<font color="yellow">What I can't stand is the thought that...</font>

218
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,340
<font color="yellow">others might get hurt.</font>

219
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,040
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

220
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,470
<font color="yellow">please...</font>

221
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,210
<font color="yellow">hold back.</font>

222
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,940
<font color="yellow">Just this once.</font>

223
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,210
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

224
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,570
<font color="yellow">I'm done.</font>

225
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,570
<font color="yellow">We'll get to work.</font>

226
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,310
<font color="yellow">We won't stop because there's a leak.</font>

227
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,670
<font color="yellow">We'll stick to the loan con.</font>

228
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,510
<font color="yellow">There's no Plan B.</font>

229
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,210
<font color="yellow">We'll go to the end.</font>

230
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,070
<font color="yellow">Does anyone have anything to say?</font>

231
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,510
<font color="yellow">If not,</font>

232
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,070
<font color="yellow">let's begin.</font>

233
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,510
<font color="yellow">Why are we here?</font>

234
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,470
<font color="yellow">There are much nicer cafes.</font>

235
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,370
<font color="yellow">They know.</font>

236
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,110
<font color="yellow">- Know what?
- That there's a spy.</font>

237
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,740
<font color="yellow">They know.</font>

238
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,870
<font color="yellow">Do they know it's you?</font>

239
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,570
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

240
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,570
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

241
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,110
<font color="yellow">What will they do?</font>

242
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,070
<font color="yellow">Change the plans?</font>

243
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,910
<font color="yellow">They don't want to suspect anyone, so it's still on.</font>

244
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,410
<font color="yellow">Is that a con, too?</font>

245
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,070
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

246
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,470
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

247
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,010
<font color="yellow">My gut says so.</font>

248
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,970
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

249
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

250
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,540
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

251
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,840
<font color="yellow">Are you suspecting me now?</font>

252
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,410
<font color="yellow">I'm here. Why else would I be here?</font>

253
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,740
<font color="yellow">It's fine if you're clean.</font>

254
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,810
<font color="yellow">When will they begin?</font>

255
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,970
<font color="yellow">Here's what you asked for.</font>

256
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,640
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

257
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,970
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

258
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,710
<font color="yellow">Can I ask what you need that for?</font>

259
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,440
<font color="yellow">Find a nice man and get married.</font>

260
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,470
<font color="yellow">I have it.</font>

261
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,410
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

262
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,410
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

263
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,010
<font color="yellow">He just left.</font>

264
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,640
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

265
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,210
<font color="yellow">Very well.</font>

266
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,680
<font color="yellow">The rest is now...</font>

267
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,440
<font color="yellow">in your hands.</font>

268
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry, Sir.</font>

269
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,570
<font color="yellow">Mr Ma.</font>

270
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,240
<font color="yellow">I have the papers and I'm headed to the bank.</font>

271
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,940
<font color="yellow">When will you be there?</font>

272
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,270
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be there?</font>

273
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,210
<font color="yellow">Of course I should be.</font>

274
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,540
<font color="yellow">Which bank is first?</font>

275
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,040
<font color="yellow">That one?</font>

276
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,610
<font color="yellow">I know where it is.</font>

277
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,340
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

278
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

279
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,440
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

280
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,540
<font color="yellow">I'm off.</font>

281
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,970
<font color="yellow">Call when you're done.</font>

282
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

283
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,410
<font color="yellow">Will it work?</font>

284
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,840
<font color="yellow">Let's make it work.</font>

285

<font color="yellow">Call when you're done.</font>

287
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,810

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,280
<font color="yellow">I'm off to get a loan.</font>

293
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,980
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from Choi Chul Woo?</font>

294
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,410
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

295
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,350
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't call,</font>

<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

300
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,680
<font color="yellow">Weren't we going to get five million each...</font>

301
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,650
<font color="yellow">and split that?</font>

302
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,280
<font color="yellow">I'm doing my part.</font>

<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

311
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,880
<font color="yellow">Did you ask for me?</font>

312
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,110
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

313
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,150
<font color="yellow">To ask for a favour.</font>

314
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,150
<font color="yellow">I'm listening, Sir.</font>

315

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,950
<font color="yellow">I need all the help I can get.</font>

318
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,910
<font color="yellow">Help me...</font>

319
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,650
<font color="yellow">Ms Chun.</font>

320
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,610
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

321
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,250
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to?</font>

322
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

323
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,810
<font color="yellow">to ask something like this.</font>

324
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,210
<font color="yellow">Do you have to...</font>

325
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,880
<font color="yellow">run again?</font>

326
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,210
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

327
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,480
<font color="yellow">You were mayor for eight years.</font>

328
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,780
<font color="yellow">You saw a lot of possibilities,</font>

329
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,880
<font color="yellow">but also a lot of boundaries and limits.</font>

330
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,010
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

331
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,610
<font color="yellow">you should give it all up...</font>

332
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,910
<font color="yellow">and make way for the next person.</font>

333
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,380
<font color="yellow">Those limits.</font>

334
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,650
<font color="yellow">Are you referring to Chairman Choi?</font>

335
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,210
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee.</font>

336
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,950
<font color="yellow">The Seowon I dream of.</font>

337
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,650
<font color="yellow">A city where the people are happy.</font>

338
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,110
<font color="yellow">This is the beginning.</font>

339
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,380
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun without the backing of Chairman Choi.</font>

340
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,480
<font color="yellow">No one has seen that before.</font>

341
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,550
<font color="yellow">I will show you...</font>

342
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,780
<font color="yellow">what your father can do.</font>

343
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,010
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

344
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,710
<font color="yellow">Here's your coffee.</font>

345
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,650
<font color="yellow">Take that ledger and pass it to Chairman Choi.</font>

346
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,150
<font color="yellow">I have to go through Cho Sang Jin's office.</font>

347
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,510
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

348
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,480
<font color="yellow">The money's in your account.</font>

349
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,280
<font color="yellow">Sort things out.</font>

350
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,010
<font color="yellow">Lie low if you can.</font>

351
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,210
<font color="yellow">I'd rather never see you again. Okay?</font>

352
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,510
<font color="yellow">Yes. I get the message.</font>

353
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,410
<font color="yellow">Here he comes.</font>

354
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,180
<font color="yellow">There are three.</font>

355
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,710
<font color="yellow">Seven million each.</font>

356
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,310
<font color="yellow">Prosecutor Cho, you can move in now.</font>

357
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,780
<font color="yellow">- Seven?
- Hello.</font>

358
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,210
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

359
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,810
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

360
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,250
<font color="yellow">It looks really nice.</font>

361
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,280
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho, you're a real expert.</font>

362
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,910
<font color="yellow">It's what I've done my whole life.</font>

363
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,050
<font color="yellow">If you take these to 10 banks,</font>

364
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,910
<font color="yellow">in just one day, you'll end up with an amount that...</font>

365
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,380
<font color="yellow">you never dreamed of having.</font>

366
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,680
<font color="yellow">You'll be richer than most people.</font>

367
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,010
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

368
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,280
<font color="yellow">Don't forget my commission, okay?</font>

369
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,580
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

370
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,050
<font color="yellow">Be nice to others when you're doing well.</font>

371
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,480
<font color="yellow">Let's go. We have to go to as many banks before closing time.</font>

372
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,350
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

373
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,710
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

374
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,450
<font color="yellow">Will you emigrate?</font>

375
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,480
<font color="yellow">I'm not really sure.</font>

376
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,750
<font color="yellow">They say Canada's nice.</font>

377
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,150
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sirs.</font>

378
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,710
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a nice day?</font>

379
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,780
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

380
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,310
<font color="yellow">Take them.</font>

381
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,880
<font color="yellow">What? Let me go.</font>

382
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,780
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me!
- Let go.</font>

383
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,680
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- Hey.</font>

384
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,750
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?
- Let go.</font>

385
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,210
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

386
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,150
<font color="yellow">How dare you touch me.</font>

387
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,680
<font color="yellow">- Not so tight.
- Come along.</font>

388
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,450
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

389
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,580
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

390
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,680
<font color="yellow">How could you, Director Ahn?</font>

391
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,410
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

392
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,710
<font color="yellow">Get in there.</font>

393
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,710
<font color="yellow">Take good care of them for me.</font>

394
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,050
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

395
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,580
<font color="yellow">Check Mr Cho's office.</font>

396
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,380
<font color="yellow">Who is Manager Kim?</font>

397
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,550
<font color="yellow">- That's me.
- Ms Kim?</font>

398
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,150
<font color="yellow">We're from Kukjin Construction. Do you have something for us?</font>

399
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,010
<font color="yellow">Does anyone have anything to say?</font>

400
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,510
<font color="yellow">If not,</font>

401
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,910
<font color="yellow">let's begin.</font>

402
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,450
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

403
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,580
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

404
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,980
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

405
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,850
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

406
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,280
<font color="yellow">Why did you betray us two years ago?</font>

407
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,580
<font color="yellow">Da Mi's Diner?</font>

408
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,750
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm doing this because of the horrible food?</font>

409
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,910
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

410
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,850
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this...</font>

411
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,150
<font color="yellow">to get back at you.</font>

412
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,550
<font color="yellow">I re-joined the team to give you a taste of your own medicine.</font>

413
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,510
<font color="yellow">I gave the money to Commissioner Ahn two years ago.</font>

414
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,950
<font color="yellow">It was all me.</font>

415
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,050
<font color="yellow">I conned you.</font>

416
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,110
<font color="yellow">Do you get it now?</font>

417
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,550
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

418
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,780
<font color="yellow">how do you feel?</font>

419
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,580
<font color="yellow">This is what you get for betraying me.</font>

420
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,210
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

421
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,650
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

422
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,950
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have done that to me, okay?</font>

424
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,010
<font color="yellow">Did you tell them?</font>

425
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,210
<font color="yellow">Did you tell them our plan?</font>

426
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,050
<font color="yellow">How could you do that?</font>

427

<font color="yellow">Hak Joo.</font>

428
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,210
<font color="yellow">You're not a human being.</font>

429
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,880
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

430
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,610
<font color="yellow">Why are you all taking it out on me?</font>

431
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,850
<font color="yellow">Is it my fault? Is it?</font>

432
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,080
<font color="yellow">If he didn't...</font>

433
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,250
<font color="yellow">I'll quit!</font>

434
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,780
<font color="yellow">Forget about it!</font>

435
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,580
<font color="yellow">Give up and go home.</font>

436
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,250
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,780
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Hak Joo.</font>

438
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,250
<font color="yellow">Thanks for telling the truth.</font>

439
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,580
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

440
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,050
<font color="yellow">I'll do as you say.</font>

441
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,010
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

442
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,980
<font color="yellow">Are you an idiot?</font>

443
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,850
<font color="yellow">Let's finish this up and have some food.</font>

444
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,110
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

445
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,380
<font color="yellow">Let's get something to eat.</font>

446
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,380
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

447
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,550
<font color="yellow">Don't just sit there.</font>

448
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,410
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll help.</font>

449
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,880
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up.
- Help out.</font>

450
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,150
<font color="yellow">I haven't...</font>

452
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,510
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you when we're done.</font>

453
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,250
<font color="yellow">They know our plan.</font>

454
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,880
<font color="yellow">I told them everything.</font>

455
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,610
<font color="yellow">We have to change the con.</font>

456
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,250
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

457
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,210
<font color="yellow">Forget about the loans. Let's go with accounting fraud.</font>

458
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,380
<font color="yellow">Do you want to give the faked accounting books to the police?</font>

459
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,150
<font color="yellow">No, that won't work.</font>

460
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
<font color="yellow">They have a prosecutor working for them.</font>

461
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,950
<font color="yellow">They'll have spies in every police station.</font>

462
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,650
<font color="yellow">- Ja Wang.
- What?</font>

463
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,350
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

464
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,550
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to post it all over the internet?</font>

465
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.</font>

466
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,550
<font color="yellow">Korea is famous for its broadband internet.</font>

467
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,820
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang. Ja Wang.</font>

468
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,150
<font color="yellow">Scan these...</font>

469
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,950
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang...</font>

470
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,350
<font color="yellow">I had...</font>

471
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,380
<font color="yellow">a tail put on you.</font>

472
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,280
<font color="yellow">Idiocy can't be helped.</font>

473
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,510
<font color="yellow">You let your emotions take control.</font>

474
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,410
<font color="yellow">You did it with Mr Bang.</font>

475
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,350
<font color="yellow">You had the girl follow him around.</font>

476
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,780
<font color="yellow">Why do you stick to the same methods?</font>

477
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,550
<font color="yellow">It's been two years. Shouldn't you be more creative?</font>

478
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,910
<font color="yellow">Hand that over. I have to take it to Chairman Choi.</font>

479
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,110
<font color="yellow">They're on to us!</font>

480
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,050
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go.</font>

481
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,480
<font color="yellow">What? Let go!</font>

482
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,650
<font color="yellow">What? What?</font>

483
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,950
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo. Hak Joo!</font>

484
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,710
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo!</font>

485
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,910
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What is it?</font>

486
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,950
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

487
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,820
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

488
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,050
<font color="yellow">Clean this up and go home.</font>

489
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,250
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way, Sir.</font>

490
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

491
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,550
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

492
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

493
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,950
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun is here.</font>

494
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,820
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun?</font>

495
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,480
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

496
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,280
<font color="yellow">Show him in.</font>

497
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,480
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

498
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,650
<font color="yellow">You didn't even call.</font>

499
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,150
<font color="yellow">I came to cut my ties with you.</font>

500
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,480
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang, are you okay?</font>

501
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,350
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo. Hak Joo.</font>

502
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,650
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo. Darn it.</font>

503
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,980
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo, wake up.</font>

504
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,280
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo!</font>

505
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,010
<font color="yellow">- What... What happened?
- What happened?</font>

506
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,850
<font color="yellow">Call 911. Hurry.</font>

507
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,580
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey.</font>

508
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,980
<font color="yellow">911?</font>

509
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,150
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

510
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,980
<font color="yellow">Cut ties with me?</font>

511
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,080
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling sick?</font>

512
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,010
<font color="yellow">Did you get heat exhaustion or something?</font>

513
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,280
<font color="yellow">You always thought I was beneath you, right?</font>

514
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,410
<font color="yellow">To you, Sir,</font>

515
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,410
<font color="yellow">I'm just another fool.</font>

516
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,480
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

517
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,110
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

518
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:50,150
<font color="yellow">You acted like you listened to me, feared me and respected me.</font>

519
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,010
<font color="yellow">That's how you've handled me all this time.</font>

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,820
<font color="yellow">when he found out you cut him loose, Mr Ahn was very bitter, too.</font>

523
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,510

524
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,550
<font color="yellow">Be quiet and move!</font>

525
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,910

526
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
<font color="yellow">But I was wrong.</font>

527
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,450
<font color="yellow">Choi Chul Woo did it...</font>

<font color="yellow">you'll lose your source of income.</font>

00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,450
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

541
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,850
<font color="yellow">Disappear from my life.</font>

542
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,140
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

543
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,400
<font color="yellow">Disappear from my life.</font>

544
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

545
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,000
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

546
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,640
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

547
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,600
<font color="yellow">I'll bring her right over.</font>

548
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,940
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

549
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,370
<font color="yellow">Why? What is it?</font>

550
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,870
<font color="yellow">There was an accident.</font>

551
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,300
<font color="yellow">I'll be a mayor who is not obsessed with money.</font>

552
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be a mayor who does not work with dirty money.</font>

553
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,740
<font color="yellow">I'll be a mayor who looks at and stands with the people.</font>

554
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,240
<font color="yellow">That's the type of mayor I'll be,</font>

555
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,470
<font color="yellow">so...</font>

556
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,670
<font color="yellow">disappear from my life...</font>

557
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,700
<font color="yellow">and from Seowon City.</font>

558
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,740
<font color="yellow">I understand what you mean.</font>

559
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,500
<font color="yellow">I do,</font>

560
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,070
<font color="yellow">but if you were such a person,</font>

561
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,240
<font color="yellow">you never should've come to me.</font>

562
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,400
<font color="yellow">Money...</font>

563
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,800
<font color="yellow">doesn't entice...</font>

564
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,800
<font color="yellow">clean people.</font>

565
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,070
<font color="yellow">Why don't you know yourself?</font>

566
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,340
<font color="yellow">What could I say when you have your hand around my throat?</font>

567
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

568
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,800
<font color="yellow">I will disappear...</font>

569
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,940
<font color="yellow">from your life...</font>

570
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,170
<font color="yellow">and Seowon City.</font>

571
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,540
<font color="yellow">But remember this one thing.</font>

572
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,470
<font color="yellow">You and I are the same.</font>

573
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,000
<font color="yellow">Even with the Maseok-dong development matter.</font>

574
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,470
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do it alone,</font>

575
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,100
<font color="yellow">but once you and I joined forces...</font>

576
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,540
<font color="yellow">Soon enough,</font>

577
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,940
<font color="yellow">you'll realise what kind of a person you are.</font>

578
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,300
<font color="yellow">The Maseok-dong development is my final consideration toward you.</font>

579
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,200
<font color="yellow">We will never have to meet again.</font>

580
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,000
<font color="yellow">Did you get a new sponsor?</font>

581
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,670
<font color="yellow">The election is just around the corner,</font>

582
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,670
<font color="yellow">but you are too confident.</font>

583
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,470
<font color="yellow">It suddenly made me wonder...</font>

584
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,940
<font color="yellow">if you had a new deep pocket.</font>

585
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,600
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

586
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,740
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

587
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,740
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

588
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,600
<font color="yellow">Will they live or die? What will happen to them?</font>

589
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,600
<font color="yellow">You're confused.</font>

590
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,070
<font color="yellow">They're sleeping after eating all of this.</font>

591
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,040
<font color="yellow">Their lives aren't in jeopardy.</font>

592
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,040
<font color="yellow">Where are Mr Baek and Jung Do?</font>

593
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,070
<font color="yellow">What will you do now?</font>

594
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,200
<font color="yellow">We'll start over.</font>

595
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,240
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

596
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,670
<font color="yellow">Do you know why the chairman has been supporting you?</font>

597
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,740
<font color="yellow">Because you were as skilled as you were arrogant.</font>

598
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,040
<font color="yellow">But Jung Do,</font>

599
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,000
<font color="yellow">all I see right now is arrogance.</font>

600
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,640
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

601
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,870
<font color="yellow">You're being arrogant again.</font>

602
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,670
<font color="yellow">Don't make excuses.</font>

603
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,570
<font color="yellow">Just tell me the conclusion. What will you do?</font>

604
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,770
<font color="yellow">How will you take Chairman Choi down?</font>

605
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's okay for me to chime in,</font>

606
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,470
<font color="yellow">but there's something I told myself for two years...</font>

607
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,340
<font color="yellow">as I waited for Jung Do to get out.</font>

608
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,540
<font color="yellow">Don't get tired.</font>

609
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,870
<font color="yellow">Hang in there,</font>

610
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,970
<font color="yellow">and once Jung Do gets out, let's fight.</font>

611
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,140
<font color="yellow">Don't fight to win, but fight until we win.</font>

612
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,670
<font color="yellow">We barely threw one jab.</font>

613
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,100
<font color="yellow">We need to hit them more until they collapse.</font>

614
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,470
<font color="yellow">It may have always been...</font>

615
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,740
<font color="yellow">an impossible foe to go up against.</font>

616
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,100
<font color="yellow">Choi Chul Woo is no easy foe.</font>

617
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,940
<font color="yellow">What will you do now, Sir?</font>

618
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,940
<font color="yellow">Tell Detective Sa Jae Sung...</font>

619
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,840
<font color="yellow">that I want to see him.</font>

620
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,540
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

621
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,440
<font color="yellow">According to the public survey,</font>

622
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,940
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun Gab Soo...</font>

623
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,740
<font color="yellow">and Woo Soo Myeong are...</font>

624
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,070
<font color="yellow">leading the polls.</font>

625
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,970
<font color="yellow">The two of them are throwing everything in...</font>

626
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,970
<font color="yellow">and battling.</font>

627
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,670
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun Gab Soo has 21.5 percent,</font>

628
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,140
<font color="yellow">and Woo Soo Myeong has 21.1 percent.</font>

629
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,970
<font color="yellow">There is a difference of only 0.4 percent...</font>

630
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,870
<font color="yellow">I hope I'm not disturbing you when you're busy.</font>

631
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,170

646

670
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,600

00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,800
<font color="yellow">A beautiful parting.</font>

673

<font color="yellow">Do you think there is such thing in this country?</font>

674
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,700
<font color="yellow">You seem to have bet on Chairman Kim Chang Soo...</font>

675
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,600
<font color="yellow">of Sangjin Group, which is why you decided...</font>

676
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,240
<font color="yellow">to cut free from Chairman Choi.</font>

677
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,970
<font color="yellow">But that is friendship, not politics.</font>

678
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,640
<font color="yellow">You should hold onto the Maseok-dong development right...</font>

679
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,170
<font color="yellow">and do another type of politics.</font>

680

681
