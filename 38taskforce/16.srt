327
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:23,004
<font color="yellow">Money?</font>

331
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,564
<font color="yellow">This isn't right,</font>

332
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:41,064

<font color="yellow">Should I do that?</font>

339
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:05,264
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me, Detective Sa?</font>

340
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:09,704
<font color="yellow">I quit being a detective long ago,</font>

<font color="yellow">You're in no position to lecture others,</font>

353
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:16,004
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know that,</font>

354
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:19,934
<font color="yellow">but will you hear me out?</font>

355
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:27,064
<font color="yellow">How will you give me the right to Maseok-dong?</font>

356
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,804
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it,</font>

357
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:32,204
<font color="yellow">Chairman Choi Chul Woo has no choice but to listen to us,</font>

358
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,164
<font color="yellow">given the current situation,</font>

359
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:36,664
<font color="yellow">Come in,</font>

360
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:42,865
<font color="yellow">The money has been prepared, Sir,</font>

361
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:44,204
<font color="yellow">Has it?</font>

362
00:30:45,764 --> 00:30:50,304
<font color="yellow">Would you lend him your car keys?</font>

363
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:51,564
<font color="yellow">Sure,</font>

364
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:59,164
<font color="yellow">The trunk is very small,</font>

365
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:00,664
<font color="yellow">Is it?</font>

366
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,664
<font color="yellow">Then we should expand your trunk first,</font>

367
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:07,234
<font color="yellow">You're doing such good work,</font>

368
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:37,164
<font color="yellow">I'll be in touch,</font>

369
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,404
<font color="yellow">Sure, Good day,</font>

370
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,704
<font color="yellow">I'll be back,</font>

371
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:21,304
<font color="yellow">Okay, bye,</font>

372
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:22,764
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, - Okay,</font>

373
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:49,204
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

374
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:51,365
<font color="yellow">What kind of a mayor am I?</font>

375
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,234
<font color="yellow">I thought I had to do it just once,</font>

376
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,334
<font color="yellow">I thought if I'd accept their help just once,,,</font>

377
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,234
<font color="yellow">and become mayor,</font>

378
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,464
<font color="yellow">I could do the things I had dreamed of,</font>

379
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,074
<font color="yellow">But you know,</font>

380
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,304
<font color="yellow">in this world,</font>

381
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:19,704
<font color="yellow">convenience becomes a privilege, consideration becomes a bribe,,,</font>

382
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,834
<font color="yellow">and friendships become a crime,</font>

383
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:26,334
<font color="yellow">Eventually, those things will hold me back,</font>

384
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,105
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one more time,</font>

385
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,004
<font color="yellow">What kind of a mayor,,,</font>

386
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,204
<font color="yellow">do you think your dad,</font>

387
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:42,304
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun Gab Soo is?</font>

388
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:48,605
<font color="yellow">Okay,</font>

389
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:51,605
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have asked,</font>

390
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:56,605
<font color="yellow">If I were a decent mayor,</font>

391
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:02,534
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't have helped that con artist,</font>

392
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,904
<font color="yellow">Okay,</font>

393
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:07,735
<font color="yellow">I'm sure,</font>

394
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:10,134
<font color="yellow">Mayor, I,,,</font>

395
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:11,404
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

396
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:13,404
<font color="yellow">Get back to work,</font>

397
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:15,105
<font color="yellow">Bye,</font>

398
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,835
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

399
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:44,434
<font color="yellow">Yes,</font>

400
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,704
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do about it?</font>

401
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:49,534
<font color="yellow">Your job,</font>

402
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,074
<font color="yellow">Your duty,</font>

403
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:54,134
<font color="yellow">That's what you should do,</font>

404
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:56,364
<font color="yellow">You're a prosecutor,</font>

405
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,105
<font color="yellow">I am giving you,,,</font>

406
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,034
<font color="yellow">a chance,</font>

407
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:36,034
<font color="yellow">I've convinced Chairman Kim Chang Soo,</font>

408
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,534
<font color="yellow">Chairman Choi found out,</font>

409
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,835
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - About eight years ago,</font>

410
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,134
<font color="yellow">Choi Chul Woo found out,</font>

411
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:55,605
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much,</font>

412
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,464
<font color="yellow">There's no evidence,</font>

413
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:01,934
<font color="yellow">And I'm sure Bang Pil Gyu is upset with Chairman Choi,</font>

414
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:04,964
<font color="yellow">so if I go talk to him,,,</font>

415
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,434
<font color="yellow">How far must we go?</font>

416
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,574
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

417
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:14,335
<font color="yellow">How far must we go for all of this to end?</font>

418
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:22,235
<font color="yellow">It isn't easy for me to hear you say that,</font>

419
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,235
<font color="yellow">We must go all the way,</font>

420
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,204
<font color="yellow">Sure,</font>

421
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:35,664
<font color="yellow">We must,</font>

422
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:39,335
<font color="yellow">That way,</font>

423
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:41,074
<font color="yellow">you'll become the vice-mayor,</font>

424
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:42,735
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

425
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:47,964
<font color="yellow">I've received campaign funds from Chairman Kim,</font>

426
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:51,904
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Chairman Choi,</font>

427
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:54,934
<font color="yellow">so you should focus on Chairman Kim from now on,</font>

428
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,605
<font color="yellow">Okay,</font>

429
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,404
<font color="yellow">Please take care of it,</font>

430
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,204

436
00:37:57,904 --> 00:38:00,034
<font color="yellow">All I did was eat at a restaurant,</font>

437

479
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:34,144
<font color="yellow">Okay,</font>

480
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,545
<font color="yellow">Bye,</font>

481
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,605
<font color="yellow">Don't bother people any more,</font>

482
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:41,775
<font color="yellow">I'm a changed man,</font>

483
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:50,674
<font color="yellow">Move the money around?</font>

484
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:51,944
<font color="yellow">Yes,</font>

485
00:41:52,474 --> 00:41:53,474
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

486
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:55,844
<font color="yellow">I asked Jin Seok,,,</font>

487
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:57,775
<font color="yellow">to mark Sa Jae Sung,</font>

488
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:00,204
<font color="yellow">According to him, Sa Jae Sung,,,</font>

489
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:01,775
<font color="yellow">was called in by Choi Chul Woo,</font>

490
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,605
<font color="yellow">Let me hear it,</font>

491
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,775
<font color="yellow">What is worth five million dollars?</font>

492
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:14,204
<font color="yellow">He'll get several million in exchange for some Intel,</font>

493
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,775
<font color="yellow">I'll get the whole team of them,,,</font>

494
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:18,944
<font color="yellow">off your back,</font>

495
00:42:19,674 --> 00:42:20,944
<font color="yellow">Give me,,,</font>

496
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:22,474
<font color="yellow">five million more,</font>

497
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:26,244
<font color="yellow">Then Choi Chul Woo will naturally gather that money,,,</font>

498
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,105
<font color="yellow">from his loan sharks in Pyeong-dong Market,</font>

499
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:29,444
<font color="yellow">Call our loan offices in Pyeong-dong,</font>

500
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:31,775
<font color="yellow">and have them send over five million in cash,</font>

501
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:35,775
<font color="yellow">While Sa Jae Sung moves with the money,</font>

502
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,944
<font color="yellow">we'll dig a trap,</font>

503
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:38,974
<font color="yellow">Where shall we meet?</font>

504
00:42:39,444 --> 00:42:40,574
<font color="yellow">To split the cash,</font>

505
00:42:40,844 --> 00:42:42,674
<font color="yellow">I'm saying let's swipe the money,</font>

506
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:45,105
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang, where is it?</font>

507
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:46,974
<font color="yellow">In the lower part of the locker,</font>

508
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:12,505
<font color="yellow">Hello,</font>

509
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,904
<font color="yellow">But why didn't you bring the money?</font>

510
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:21,875
<font color="yellow">Money? What money?</font>

511
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:26,545
<font color="yellow">Why would I give you any money, you punk?</font>

512
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:29,045
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything right,</font>

513
00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:49,775
<font color="yellow">Then we'll take that money and give it to Chairman Wang,</font>

514
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,474
<font color="yellow">The money has been prepared, Sir,</font>

515
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:52,875
<font color="yellow">Has it?</font>

516
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:56,974
<font color="yellow">Chairman Wang will pretend it's his and give it to Ahn Tae Wook,</font>

517
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,074
<font color="yellow">The trunk,,,</font>

518
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:02,944
<font color="yellow">is very small,</font>

519
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,704
<font color="yellow">Is it?</font>

520
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:08,545
<font color="yellow">Then we should expand your trunk first,</font>

521
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:11,304
<font color="yellow">Is Chairman Wang with him now?</font>

522
00:44:11,304 --> 00:44:14,304
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ahn Tae Wook just figured out that Chairman Wang,,,</font>

523
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:16,005
<font color="yellow">is working with us,</font>

524
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,674
<font color="yellow">So we asked Chairman Wang to act like he's switching sides,</font>

525
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:20,875
<font color="yellow">I've,,,</font>

526
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:23,744
<font color="yellow">cut ties with Jung Do,</font>

527
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:26,304
<font color="yellow">If we move the money like that,</font>

528
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:28,344
<font color="yellow">Pyeong-dong loan sharks' money,,,</font>

529
00:44:28,704 --> 00:44:30,275
<font color="yellow">will go to Choi Chul Woo,</font>

530
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:31,744
<font color="yellow">and through a broker,,,</font>

531
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:34,074
<font color="yellow">It will be handed over to a second broker,,,</font>

532
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,105
<font color="yellow">Who will give that money,,,</font>

533
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,844
<font color="yellow">To Chun Gab Soo's campaign,,,</font>

534
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:40,404
<font color="yellow">as an illegal contribution,</font>

535
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,804
<font color="yellow">Then Choi Chul Woo, Chun Gab Soo, Ahn Tae Wook,</font>

536
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,574
<font color="yellow">Sa Jae Sung and the second broker,,,</font>

537
00:44:45,574 --> 00:44:46,904
<font color="yellow">will all go down,</font>

538
00:44:47,304 --> 00:44:48,674
<font color="yellow">Who will be the second broker?</font>

539
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:52,045
<font color="yellow">I bought someone who will go to prison for us,</font>

540
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,275
<font color="yellow">You bought someone? You don't have the money,</font>

541
00:44:57,605 --> 00:44:59,974
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I have the money? I have a lot of money,</font>

542
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,545
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it, so don't worry too much,</font>

543
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:08,204
<font color="yellow">Ms Noh, call the reporter and have him follow with his camera,</font>

544
00:45:08,344 --> 00:45:10,775
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo, report it to the police, Okay?</font>

545
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,974
<font color="yellow">Okay,</font>

546
00:45:12,244 --> 00:45:14,074
<font color="yellow">That's all,</font>

547
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,105
<font color="yellow">Is it Chairman Wang's order?</font>

548
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:20,605
<font color="yellow">No, It's my decision,</font>

549
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:24,545
<font color="yellow">The money transferred to the second broker, Yang,</font>

550
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:27,904
<font color="yellow">was transferred to Ahn, who is known to be,,,</font>

00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:29,804
<font color="yellow">Mayor Chun Gab Soo's aide,</font>

552

00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:34,775
<font color="yellow">unless someone on the inside testifies,</font>

554
00:45:35,344 --> 00:45:36,574
<font color="yellow">there's no way,</font>

555
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:39,804
<font color="yellow">The case will be dragged out and eventually dropped,</font>

556
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:41,904
<font color="yellow">What if we have someone who will testify?</font>

557
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:43,674
<font color="yellow">And who would that be?</font>

558
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:45,944
<font color="yellow">You know Yang Jung Do, don't you?</font>

559
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:48,444
<font color="yellow">You locked him up two years ago,</font>

<font color="yellow">Sir, Jung Do and I,,,</font>

561
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,304

00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:03,204
<font color="yellow">didn't do this,</font>

00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:05,045
<font color="yellow">we couldn't even touch,,,</font>

565
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:06,974
<font color="yellow">those rats that we should be fighting,</font>

566
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:10,444

569
