00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,050
<font color="yellow">You have quite the temper.</font>

159
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,810
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I'll fill you in.</font>

160
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,980
<font color="yellow">A friend of mine called Chang Hyun...</font>

161
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,550
<font color="yellow">is an appraiser at Busan Harbour.</font>

162
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,997
<font color="yellow">When we get something from abroad,</font>

163
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:40,780
<font color="yellow">the port appraiser decides whether something is...</font>

164
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,187
<font color="yellow">genuine or fake.</font>

165
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,710
<font color="yellow">We're abusing the system.</font>

166
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,110
<font color="yellow">You have the appraiser lie about the artefact...</font>

167
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,650
<font color="yellow">and bring it past customs?</font>

168
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,000
<font color="yellow">When it's real?</font>

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,050
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

170
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,640
<font color="yellow">It's a real bargain.</font>

171
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,950
<font color="yellow">You get them at a huge discount.</font>

172
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,110
<font color="yellow">Is that how you got this?</font>

173
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, no, this is a genuinely rare artefact.</font>

174
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,750
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see it?</font>

175
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,750
<font color="yellow">I know you know a thing or two.</font>

176
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,980
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

177
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,733
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't touch it, but I'm an expert,</font>

178
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,550
<font color="yellow">so I don't leave fingerprints even if I touch it.</font>

179
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,550
<font color="yellow">I'll show you.</font>

180
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,210
<font color="yellow">There. See?</font>

181
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,150
<font color="yellow">Look at the colour.</font>

182
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,550
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

183
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,843
<font color="yellow">so beautiful.</font>

184
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,810
<font color="yellow">Isn't it? You have a good eye.</font>

185
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,450
<font color="yellow">This is difficult to find.</font>

186
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,250
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

187
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,250
<font color="yellow">just give this to you.</font>

188
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,040
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

189
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,050
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

190
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,050
<font color="yellow">I can't take something this precious.</font>

191
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,180
<font color="yellow">- Is it a fake?
-  Come on, now.</font>

192
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,330
<font color="yellow">You saw how nice it was.</font>

193
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,150
<font color="yellow">I don't deal with fakes.</font>

194
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,380
<font color="yellow">I only wear fake clothes.</font>

195
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,250
<font color="yellow">Then why are you giving this to me?</font>

196
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,580
<font color="yellow">Think of it as a token of appreciation.</font>

197
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,950
<font color="yellow">That way, you'll keep our little secret from today.</font>

198
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,010
<font color="yellow">Take this and let's just say we're in the same boat.</font>

199
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,480
<font color="yellow">I'll help you when you need,</font>

200
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
<font color="yellow">and you can help me when I'm in need.</font>

201
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,380
<font color="yellow">Okay? What do you say?</font>

202
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,450
<font color="yellow">Would you like to take this or should I take it back?</font>

203
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,650
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

204
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,110
<font color="yellow">Ms Bang.</font>

205
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,380
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

206
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,850
<font color="yellow">Why? Is it a fake?</font>

207
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,380
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

208
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,210
<font color="yellow">You can probably get 200,000 dollars for this.</font>

209
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
<font color="yellow">(Bang Min A)</font>

210
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,380
<font color="yellow">It's her. It's her.</font>

211
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,710
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

212
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,950
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

213
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,580
<font color="yellow">You said we're on the same side now, right?</font>

214
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,380
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. Of course, we're on the same side.</font>

215
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,450
<font color="yellow">If that's the case,</font>

216
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,380
<font color="yellow">can you comfort me too?</font>

217
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,310
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'll treat you.</font>

218
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,436
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

219
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:55,580
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I've been hurt a lot because of the laws.</font>

220
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,850
<font color="yellow">Would you please treat my wounds?</font>

221
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,750
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'll treat you.</font>

222
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,450
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Okay.</font>

223
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,350
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

224
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,010
<font color="yellow">Wow. We got her. We got her.</font>

225
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,310
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

226
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,710
<font color="yellow">That hurts. You startled me.</font>

227
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,710
<font color="yellow">I must be a good con man now.</font>

228
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,380
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

229
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,180
<font color="yellow">You need to eat with me.</font>

230
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,080
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Are you on your way?</font>

231
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,250
<font color="yellow">- Jung Do?
-  Yes.</font>

232
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,120
<font color="yellow">- I'm at...
-  I'm not going. Why should I?</font>

233
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,180
<font color="yellow">- Hear me out. I'm at...
-  I'm not going. Don't tell me.</font>

234
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,080
<font color="yellow">- I told you.
-  I told you I wasn't going.</font>

235
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,587
<font color="yellow">This wasn't my idea.</font>

236
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,250
<font color="yellow">I refuse. Tell him I'm dead.</font>

237
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,820
<font color="yellow">- Why do you...
-  I'm at...</font>

238
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,210
<font color="yellow">your office, is what I was about to say.</font>

239
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,180
<font color="yellow">- You should've let me finish.
-  Are you insane?</font>

240
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,050
<font color="yellow">- How could you come...
-  I know.</font>

241
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,680
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hurry...</font>

242
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,680
<font color="yellow">You must still be very angry.</font>

243
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,910
<font color="yellow">Not at all. We made up last night. She isn't angry.</font>

244
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,550
<font color="yellow">Right, Honey?</font>

245
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,880
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you speaking?</font>

246
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,210
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Honey?</font>

247
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,950
<font color="yellow">Yes. Sure. We made up.</font>

248
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

249
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,910
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

250
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,380
<font color="yellow">Shall we go eat?</font>

251
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,437
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you</font>

252
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,320
<font color="yellow">- Happy birthday to you
-  It's my birthday?</font>

253
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,540
<font color="yellow">- Happy birthday, my wife
-  Happy birthday, Mrs Cho</font>

254
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,450
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you</font>

255
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,793
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

256
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,080
<font color="yellow">- Happy Birthday.
-  Happy Birthday.</font>

257
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,650
<font color="yellow">Isn't he so cute when he eats?</font>

258
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,750
<font color="yellow">How are you so cute?</font>

259
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,550
<font color="yellow">She says she married me because I look cute when I eat.</font>

260
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,150
<font color="yellow">What did you like about Mr Cho?</font>

261
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,464
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

262
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:38,380
<font color="yellow">I heard you chased him around in college.</font>

263
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

264
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,710
<font color="yellow">I chased him around in college.</font>

265
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,550
<font color="yellow">So why did you chase him around?</font>

266
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,050
<font color="yellow">I can't remember very well.</font>

267
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,650
<font color="yellow">You must be embarrassed.</font>

268
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,250
<font color="yellow">Tell us.</font>

269
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,710
<font color="yellow">What did you like so much about him?</font>

270
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,850
<font color="yellow">Tell us. I want to know too.</font>

271
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,010
<font color="yellow">What did you like so much about me?</font>

272
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,610
<font color="yellow">I really don't remember.</font>

273
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,450
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

274
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,380
<font color="yellow">I don't remember anything.</font>

275
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,820
<font color="yellow">That's how it is.</font>

276
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,180
<font color="yellow">When you are hurt badly by someone, you can't remember...</font>

277
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,980
<font color="yellow">what you liked about them.</font>

278
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,980
<font color="yellow">Why did I like him?</font>

279
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,650
<font color="yellow">What emotions did I feel?</font>

280
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,980
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

281
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,350
<font color="yellow">I can't remember any of it.</font>

282
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,150
<font color="yellow">That's how it was for me.</font>

283
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,550
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho must have cheated on her.</font>

284
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,510
<font color="yellow">Why do they have so much to talk about?</font>

285
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,050
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

286
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,680
<font color="yellow">When you look at him,</font>

287
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,750
<font color="yellow">don't you want to punch him?</font>

288
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,850
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

289
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,080
<font color="yellow">I really want to step on that stupid pig.</font>

290
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,050
<font color="yellow">You looked so happy. Why are you...</font>

291
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,550
<font color="yellow">You mean how I said he's cute when he eats?</font>

292
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,470
<font color="yellow">- Well...
-  I dated him because he was rich...</font>

293
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,930
<font color="yellow">and married him because he was rich.</font>

294
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,710
<font color="yellow">I tried to like him and said he was a good eater,</font>

295
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,910
<font color="yellow">and he stuffs his face all the time.</font>

296
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,610
<font color="yellow">I should rip out his jaw...</font>

297
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,610
<font color="yellow">so he can stop eating.</font>

298
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,810
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

299
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,350
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

300
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,650
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

301
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,380
<font color="yellow">That woman is so strange.</font>

302
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,850
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

303
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,650
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

304
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,310
<font color="yellow">Your car's at City Hall, right?</font>

305
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,950
<font color="yellow">I guess you'll need to get a cab.</font>

306
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,750
<font color="yellow">I should.</font>

307
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,210
<font color="yellow">There are no cabs here,</font>

308
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,710
<font color="yellow">so let's walk a little.</font>

309
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,350
<font color="yellow">There are cabs right there.</font>

310
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,780
<font color="yellow">Come on. Let's go.</font>

311
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

312
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,510
<font color="yellow">What did you two talk about?</font>

313
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,050
<font color="yellow">Just. About investing.</font>

314
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,680
<font color="yellow">How much should I put in?</font>

315
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,350
<font color="yellow">However much you want is fine,</font>

316
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,794
<font color="yellow">but let me be honest.</font>

317
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,880
<font color="yellow">If you put in chump change, you'll only make chump change.</font>

318
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,750
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be a man,</font>

319
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,780
<font color="yellow">a real man, and play big?</font>

320
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,210
<font color="yellow">What's playing big?</font>

321
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,380
<font color="yellow">Smuggling?</font>

322
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,210
<font color="yellow">It's technically smuggling,</font>

323
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,180
<font color="yellow">but it's not illegal.</font>

324
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,257
<font color="yellow">That's how it is.</font>

325
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:14,900
<font color="yellow">There are cultural artefacts being dug up every day.</font>

326
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,850
<font color="yellow">Replicas are making a killing.</font>

327
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,850
<font color="yellow">You'll mix in a few real artefacts with the shipments of replicas,</font>

328
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,480
<font color="yellow">so invest in that. Is that it?</font>

329
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

330
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,050
<font color="yellow">You got it right away.</font>

331
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,180
<font color="yellow">Why couldn't Bang Ho Seok get it?</font>

332
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

333
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,210
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying we'll sell replicas claiming they're real.</font>

334
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,330
<font color="yellow">We'll mix in some real ones with the replicas.</font>

335
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,910
<font color="yellow">We'll mix them in and import them together. Together.</font>

336
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,350
<font color="yellow">You don't get it.</font>

337
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,850
<font color="yellow">Am I speaking Chinese?</font>

338
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,750
<font color="yellow">I get it now.</font>

339
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,780
<font color="yellow">You'll throw in some real ones with the replicas.</font>

340
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,094
<font color="yellow">So what did he say? Will he invest?</font>

341
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:09,180
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

342
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,710
<font color="yellow">He'll refuse initially.</font>

343
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,257
<font color="yellow">That sounds too tough for me.</font>

344
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,780
<font color="yellow">So I worked him.</font>

345
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,280
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang.</font>

346
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,610
<font color="yellow">If you get...</font>

347
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,610
<font color="yellow">products for cheap in China and sell them in Korea,</font>

348
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,780
<font color="yellow">you make at least 10 times the money in profit.</font>

349
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,050
<font color="yellow">How long...</font>

350
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,550
<font color="yellow">How long will you play with chump change?</font>

351
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,080
<font color="yellow">Does that even pay for your baby's formula?</font>

352
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,050
<font color="yellow">But I don't think I can do it.</font>

353
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,610
<font color="yellow">It's a world in which money makes money and the rich become rich.</font>

354
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,810
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't make this offer if you were poor.</font>

355
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,310
<font color="yellow">How long will you make six figures?</font>

356
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,910
<font color="yellow">That's not even considered rich...</font>

357
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,210
<font color="yellow">in China any more.</font>

358
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,980
<font color="yellow">They give the kids that much for their birthdays.</font>

359
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,080
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang.</font>

360
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,910
<font color="yellow">Don't be complacent.</font>

361
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,250
<font color="yellow">Let's look to be billionaires.</font>

362
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,987
<font color="yellow">How great does that sound?</font>

363
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,210
<font color="yellow">Billionaires.</font>

364
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,810
<font color="yellow">It's so nice.</font>

365
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,080
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

366
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,610
<font color="yellow">I can see the goods before we start, right?</font>

367
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,780
<font color="yellow">Not a problem.</font>

368
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,210
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

369
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,310
<font color="yellow">Don't drag me into this any more.</font>

370
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,580
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't. Good night.</font>

371
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,150
<font color="yellow">- Drive safely, please.
-  I will.</font>

372
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,480
<font color="yellow">(Yang Jung Do)</font>

373
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,750
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

374
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,980
<font color="yellow">How's the ride?</font>

375
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,950
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

376
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

377
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,510
<font color="yellow">that only I have the good memories.</font>

378
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,780
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

379
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,480
<font color="yellow">What I did with you wasn't love.</font>

380
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,080
<font color="yellow">It was a con.</font>

381
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,280
<font color="yellow">Jung Do.</font>

382
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
<font color="yellow">Is that her?</font>

383
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,050
<font color="yellow">Did you really like her?</font>

384
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,810
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

385
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,310
<font color="yellow">There's no way. Not someone like you.</font>

386
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,220
<font color="yellow">It's obvious she has no money.</font>

387
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,350
<font color="yellow">Why did you waste your time on a girl like that?</font>

388
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,880
<font color="yellow">You know, the first thing...</font>

389
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,110
<font color="yellow">I ever did after turning 20...</font>

390
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,850
<font color="yellow">What was real just became fake.</font>

391
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,380
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

392
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,510
<font color="yellow">can we just go?</font>

393
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,010
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's merge the jobs.</font>

394
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,910
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang, get a montage of the goods from China.</font>

395
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,540
<font color="yellow">You find me items similar to these.</font>

396
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

397
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,210
<font color="yellow">You stay on Commissioner Ahn.</font>

398
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,310
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

399
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,240
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
-  What is this?</font>

400
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,870
<font color="yellow">- Oh gosh.
-  Wait.</font>

401
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,840
<font color="yellow">Look who this is.</font>

402
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,990
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I ran into you.</font>

403
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,640
<font color="yellow">Memorise these. There's a lot.</font>

404
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,010
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

405
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,920
<font color="yellow">Post 20th century, it was...</font>

406
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,200
<font color="yellow">I'll contact Bang Ho Seok.</font>

407
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang. The sample came in.</font>

408
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
<font color="yellow">Would you like to see it?</font>

409
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,870
<font color="yellow">He will call his sister since she's an expert on antiques.</font>

410
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,320
<font color="yellow">Hi, Min A. I have a favour to ask.</font>

411
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,740
<font color="yellow">Then whom will Bang Min A call?</font>

412
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,570
<font color="yellow">May I ask for a favour?</font>

413
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,040
<font color="yellow">It's for my brother.</font>

414
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,480
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat.
-  Thank you.</font>

415
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,810
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

416
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,910
<font color="yellow">There she is.</font>

417
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,480
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Cho Hee Joon.</font>

418
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,510
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

419
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,110
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

420
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,340
<font color="yellow">The only antique expert that Bang Min A trusts.</font>

421
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,910
<font color="yellow">A public official who is just a bit dirty.</font>

422
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,240
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

423
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,770
<font color="yellow">Let's do it.</font>

424
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,370
<font color="yellow">This is something I paid a lot of money for.</font>

425
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,170
<font color="yellow">Is this that expensive?</font>

426
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,310
<font color="yellow">It looks like clay.</font>

427
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,670
<font color="yellow">Have a look, please.</font>

428
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,440
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

429
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,710
<font color="yellow">Who is that gentleman?</font>

430
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,310
<font color="yellow">Her friend from the Cultural Heritage Administration.</font>

431
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,860
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

432
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,610
<font color="yellow">It must be nice to know someone who works there.</font>

433
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,410
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me he'd be here?</font>

434
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,310
<font color="yellow">I could've brought an expert, too.</font>

435
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,110
<font color="yellow">I hope you aren't upset.</font>

436
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

437
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,340
<font color="yellow">I know it's not easy for one to trust another.</font>

438
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

439
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,170
<font color="yellow">Treat it with care, Mr Expert.</font>

440
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,070
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry about that.</font>

441
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,010
<font color="yellow">This is wrong.</font>

442
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,010
<font color="yellow">This is very wrong.</font>

443
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,110
<font color="yellow">What? Is it a replica?</font>

444
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,370
<font color="yellow">This is bad.</font>

445
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,310
<font color="yellow">It's bad.</font>

446
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,840
<font color="yellow">This shouldn't be here.</font>

447
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,940
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

448
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,540
<font color="yellow">This shouldn't be private property.</font>

449
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,540
<font color="yellow">This should be in a museum where everyone can see it.</font>

450
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,910
<font color="yellow">This has immense historic value.</font>

451
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,780
<font color="yellow">This is a Tang Dynasty sancai.</font>

452
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,410
<font color="yellow">Something like this was first unearthed...</font>

453
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,410
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

454
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,170
<font color="yellow">how much is it?</font>

455
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,340
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

456
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,820
<font color="yellow">In the 20th century,</font>

457
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,140
<font color="yellow">when the Chinese built the railroads,</font>

458
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,620
<font color="yellow">they unearthed a lot of artefacts by bulk.</font>

459
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,570
<font color="yellow">Okay. So, how much is it?</font>

460
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,350
<font color="yellow">Hear me out first.</font>

461
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,660
<font color="yellow">In 1928, when they were building a railroad...</font>

462
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,670
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

463
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,370
<font color="yellow">How much is this worth in Korea?</font>

464
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,740
<font color="yellow">Move your hand, please.</font>

465
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,910
<font color="yellow">This is worth at least...</font>

466
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,940
<font color="yellow">500,000 dollars.</font>

467
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,970
<font color="yellow">100,000 dollars became 500,000 dollars.</font>

468
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,540
<font color="yellow">What great magic.</font>

469
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,670
<font color="yellow">Mr Cho.</font>

470
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,970
<font color="yellow">You can let go. No need to grab my hand.</font>

471
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,570
<font color="yellow">- See you, Min A.
-  Bye.</font>

472
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,020
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  Bye.</font>

473
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,170
<font color="yellow">- See you.
-  See you again.</font>

474
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,640
<font color="yellow">Thanks for coming all this way.</font>

475
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,640
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. We should help each other.</font>

476
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,910
<font color="yellow">Are you free later today?</font>

477
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,810
<font color="yellow">I think so. Why?</font>

478
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,120
<font color="yellow">Can I take you somewhere?</font>

479
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,440
<font color="yellow">I'll show you something.</font>

480
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,210
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

481
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,640
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking and...</font>

482
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
<font color="yellow">I can't stop marvelling at your great skill.</font>

483
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,410
<font color="yellow">How did you get into this business?</font>

484
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,410
<font color="yellow">It's the age of globalisation.</font>

485
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,410
<font color="yellow">China is just across the pond.</font>

486
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,670
<font color="yellow">Why should we fight for a tiny piece of Korea?</font>

487
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,840
<font color="yellow">You're right. Globalisation.</font>

488
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,210
<font color="yellow">Let's get to business.</font>

489
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,170
<font color="yellow">We'll be getting shipments every other week from China.</font>

490
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,670
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

491
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,240
<font color="yellow">Right. You said that was a sample.</font>

492
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,570
<font color="yellow">How many will we get this time?</font>

493
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,280
<font color="yellow">About 300, I think.</font>

494
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,280
<font color="yellow">300?</font>

495
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,110
<font color="yellow">15 million dollars.</font>

496
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,710
<font color="yellow">It's 150 million.</font>

497
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,070
<font color="yellow">Get your numbers straight.</font>

498
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,780
<font color="yellow">Right, 150 million.</font>

499
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,000
<font color="yellow">100,000 dollars times 300 items is 30 million dollars.</font>

500
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,970
<font color="yellow">If we deduct labour costs, commission,</font>

501
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,110
<font color="yellow">appraisal and transportation fees, we'll be left with...</font>

502
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,910
<font color="yellow">half of 150 million dollars?</font>

503
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,440
<font color="yellow">You mean... 75 million dollars?</font>

504
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,880
<font color="yellow">You got that one right.</font>

505
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,910
<font color="yellow">75 million dollars.</font>

506
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,940
<font color="yellow">Invest 30 million and you get 75 million back.</font>

507
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,440
<font color="yellow">Would you be interested?</font>

508
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,040
<font color="yellow">It is a great opportunity, but...</font>

509
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,610
<font color="yellow">But what?</font>

510
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,940
<font color="yellow">Do you still have doubts?</font>

511
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,140
<font color="yellow">Get your sister's friend to appraise the whole lot.</font>

512
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,780
<font color="yellow">This means...</font>

513
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,550
<font color="yellow">I need to borrow money.</font>

514
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,940
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

515
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
<font color="yellow">A loan...</font>

516
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,390
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

517
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,280
<font color="yellow">you should go for it.</font>

518
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,300
<font color="yellow">You'll make a 250 percent profit.</font>

519
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,740
<font color="yellow">Shall I lend you the money?</font>

520
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,940
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

521
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
<font color="yellow">I couldn't borrow your money.</font>

522
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,610
<font color="yellow">I'm just grateful you let me invest.</font>

523
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,970
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Let's do it.</font>

524
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,870
<font color="yellow">I'll get the money soon.</font>

525
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,640
<font color="yellow">Do you remember how much you need?</font>

526
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,070
<font color="yellow">30 million dollars.</font>

527
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,740
<font color="yellow">You need to give me 30 million, okay, Mr Bang?</font>

528
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. 30 million.</font>

529
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,970
<font color="yellow">When can I see what's coming into Busan Harbour?</font>

530
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,170
<font color="yellow">About two weeks.</font>

531
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,050
<font color="yellow">How much do you need?</font>

532
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,710
<font color="yellow">I told my friend to focus on ceramic vases.</font>

533
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,400
<font color="yellow">A Japanese buyer made a big offer.</font>

534
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,410
<font color="yellow">I think they're negotiating.</font>

535
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,810
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

536
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,740
<font color="yellow">After we deduct all the expenses, we'll be left with 20 million.</font>

537
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,870
<font color="yellow">- And the profit?
-  At least triple that.</font>

538
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,340
<font color="yellow">As long as we aren't caught.</font>

539
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,970
<font color="yellow">Can you come with me?</font>

540
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,370
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

541
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,970
<font color="yellow">Mr Choo.</font>

542
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,140
<font color="yellow">I don't trust people.</font>

543
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,110
<font color="yellow">The older you get, the more people hide away.</font>

544
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,240
<font color="yellow">You hide your emotions and your wrinkles.</font>

545
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,170
<font color="yellow">These are different, though.</font>

546
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,940
<font color="yellow">They show you their imperfections.</font>

547
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,170
<font color="yellow">Chips, discolouration. Everything.</font>

548
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,340
<font color="yellow">Just as they are.</font>

549
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,040
<font color="yellow">That's why they're so valuable.</font>

550
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,250
<font color="yellow">I've been collecting for 20 years.</font>

551
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,110
<font color="yellow">They say they're the real deal.</font>

552
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,010
<font color="yellow">Could you appraise these for me?</font>

553
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,370
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you handsomely.</font>

554
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,740
<font color="yellow">I trust you, for some strange reason.</font>

555
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,840
<font color="yellow">Maybe because we're allies.</font>

556
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,710
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

557
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sure.</font>

558
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,280
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

559
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,910
<font color="yellow">Sung Il's target is Bang Pil Gyu.</font>

560
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,170
<font color="yellow">His back taxes of 50 million dollars.</font>

561
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

562
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,140
<font color="yellow">Get me the mayor.</font>

563
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,810
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

564
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,140
<font color="yellow">Let's be careful. Nothing's sure yet.</font>

565
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,710
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

566
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

567
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,940
<font color="yellow">(Chief Baek Sung Il)</font>

568
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,400
<font color="yellow">Where's your chief?</font>

569
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,240
<font color="yellow">He's out at the moment.</font>

570
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,570
<font color="yellow">- On business.
-  That's right.</font>

571
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,510
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

572
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,110
<font color="yellow">All alone? Leaving you here, hard at work?</font>

573
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,740
<font color="yellow">There's a problem with a taxpayer we couldn't deal with from here.</font>

574
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,910
<font color="yellow">He went to the borough office to get some files.</font>

575
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,540
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about that?</font>

576
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,640
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Your chief.</font>

577
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,440
<font color="yellow">Did he go to the borough office?</font>

578
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. He did.</font>

579
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,570
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

580
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,310
<font color="yellow">When he returns,</font>

581
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,410
<font color="yellow">I'd like to see him.</font>

582
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,810
<font color="yellow">Give him the message.</font>

583
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,510
<font color="yellow">I will, Sir.</font>

584
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,440
<font color="yellow">Is she in the know?</font>

585
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,070
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you, but...</font>

586
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,370
<font color="yellow">Does she know?</font>

587
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

588
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,070
<font color="yellow">Is she helping them?</font>

589
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,670
<font color="yellow">I don't know that yet.</font>

590
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,090
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

591
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,970
<font color="yellow">We have circumstantial evidence that...</font>

592
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,740
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek is trying to con Mr Bang.</font>

593
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,570
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to give him a call?</font>

594
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,240
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

595
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,140
<font color="yellow">Mr Bang's son and daughter have fallen for it?</font>

596
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,270
<font color="yellow">Is it that easy to make 50 million dollars?</font>

597
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,770
<font color="yellow">Get to work.</font>

598
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,670
<font color="yellow">See Mr Bang and make a deal.</font>

599
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,940
<font color="yellow">Unless he wants to lose 50 million,</font>

600
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,670
<font color="yellow">he should get me out.</font>

601
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,410
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

602
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,310
<font color="yellow">Cold feet?</font>

603
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
<font color="yellow">Does the thought of betraying Jung Do...</font>

604
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,310
<font color="yellow">scare you now?</font>

605
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,010
<font color="yellow">- It's not that.
-  Call Detective Jang.</font>

606
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,070
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
-  Call him right now.</font>

607
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,970
<font color="yellow">He'll drag you by your hair...</font>

608
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,210
<font color="yellow">and slam you in a cell.</font>

609
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,670
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

610
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,270
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

611
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,080
<font color="yellow">With Jung Do gone,</font>

612
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,570
<font color="yellow">you can get back to your old life.</font>

613
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,940
<font color="yellow">You can...</font>

614
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,770
<font color="yellow">go back to taking money from scumbags blinded with lust.</font>

615
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,270
<font color="yellow">I'll look after you.</font>

616
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,170
<font color="yellow">But if you...</font>

617
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,270
<font color="yellow">stick to Jung Do...</font>

618
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,610
<font color="yellow">like the moronic public official did,</font>

619
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,010
<font color="yellow">you will rot behind bars...</font>

620
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,510
<font color="yellow">until the day you die.</font>

621
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,370
<font color="yellow">I will see to that.</font>

622
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,510
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

623
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,510
<font color="yellow">you will never get to put any makeup...</font>

624
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,670
<font color="yellow">on that pretty face of yours.</font>

625
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,170
<font color="yellow">I will make that happen.</font>

626
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,910
<font color="yellow">Do you get that?</font>

627
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,670
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

628
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,440
<font color="yellow">Who will you side with?</font>

629
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,410
<font color="yellow">Tell me, you witch.</font>

630
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,210
<font color="yellow">That is all I can tell you.</font>

631
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,210
<font color="yellow">The rest is up to you.</font>

632
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,410
<font color="yellow">Call Dad.</font>

633
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,570
<font color="yellow">Now.</font>

634
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,510
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

635
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,010
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

636
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,070
<font color="yellow">Dad, let me explain. I was...</font>

637
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,270
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

638
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,840
<font color="yellow">- Dad.
-  You fool.</font>

639
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,870
<font color="yellow">You moron.</font>

640
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,740
<font color="yellow">You imbecile!</font>

641
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,910
<font color="yellow">What did I teach you?</font>

642
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,490
<font color="yellow">I raised you better than this!</font>

643
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,510
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

644
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,670
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry, Dad.</font>

645
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,440
<font color="yellow">I won't do it again.</font>

646
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,370
<font color="yellow">Sa Jae Sung wants to be let out?</font>

647
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,370
<font color="yellow">Commissioner Ahn.</font>

648
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,810
<font color="yellow">He has a prosecutor friend, doesn't he?</font>

649
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,440
<font color="yellow">Ask for his help.</font>

650
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,910
<font color="yellow">I'll give him a call.</font>

651
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,370
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

652
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,370
<font color="yellow">Tell him I'll meet him for dinner.</font>

653
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,540
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

654
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,070
<font color="yellow">about the conning scumbags.</font>

655
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,010
<font color="yellow">What should we do with them?</font>

656
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,370
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ma'am.</font>

657
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,110
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

658
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,440
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll come right over.</font>

659
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,210
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

660
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,210
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way.</font>

661
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,410
<font color="yellow">Why your sister's home, though?</font>

662
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,440
<font color="yellow">She's a great cook.</font>

663
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,740
<font color="yellow">She wants to eat together to thank you for helping me.</font>

664
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,070
<font color="yellow">Hurry over.</font>

665
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,640
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

666
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,240
<font color="yellow">He's coming.</font>

667
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,710
<font color="yellow">Ms Bang. Ms Bang.</font>

668
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,440
<font color="yellow">I need a favour.</font>

669
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be here.</font>

670
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,110
<font color="yellow">I can't face them again after this.</font>

671
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,010
<font color="yellow">I can't look into Jung Do's eyes.</font>

672
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,140
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see this coming?</font>

673
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:49,980
<font color="yellow">- Ms Bang, please.
-  Leave her alone.</font>

674
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,340
<font color="yellow">- Let me leave.
-  Back off.</font>

675
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,040
<font color="yellow">- I really can't face them.
-  Let go.</font>

676
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,040
<font color="yellow">Come upstairs.</font>

677
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:29,080
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to come here. We can handle it.</font>

678
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,240
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see their faces.</font>

679
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,010
<font color="yellow">When will they arrive?</font>

680
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,870
<font color="yellow">I called them over already.</font>

681
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,840
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

682
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,870
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

683
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,440
<font color="yellow">I think we're caught.</font>

684
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,320
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

685
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,850
<font color="yellow">I think we're caught.</font>

686
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,180
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

687
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,820
<font color="yellow">Hand them over to the police.</font>

688
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,950
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait. Hold on. You. Get over here.</font>

689
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,550
<font color="yellow">You rat. You rat.</font>

690
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,160
<font color="yellow">You rat. I knew it from the start.</font>

691
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,520
<font color="yellow">Do you know who my dad is?</font>

692
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,970
<font color="yellow">You punk. Pay up for the dinner I bought.</font>

693
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,980
<font color="yellow">- Come out.
-  Pay up, you rat!</font>

694
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,130
<font color="yellow">500 percent?</font>

695
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,250
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

696
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,520
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  Let go.</font>

697
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,220
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

698
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,150
<font color="yellow">Drag them out of here!</font>

699
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,620
<font color="yellow">Take them!</font>

700
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,720
<font color="yellow">You are... You're so...</font>

701
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,620
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

702
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,320
<font color="yellow">Hi, Sung Hee.</font>

703
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,520
<font color="yellow">Something came up,</font>

704
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,750
<font color="yellow">so I'll have to take two days off. Can you submit the request for me?</font>

705
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,920
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

706
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,820
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

707
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,180
<font color="yellow">No. Nothing's wrong.</font>

708
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,020
<font color="yellow">Two days should suffice.</font>

709
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,620
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

710
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,780
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

711
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,280
<font color="yellow">Can't you do something?</font>

712
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,820
<font color="yellow">They didn't complete the con,</font>

713
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,160
<font color="yellow">but there was intent.</font>

714
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,220
<font color="yellow">My friend works at Supreme Prosecutors' Office.</font>

715
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,380
<font color="yellow">Then go there.</font>

716
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,650
<font color="yellow">- It's too late!
-  My son is giving his statement,</font>

717
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,150
<font color="yellow">so make everything fall into place...</font>

718
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,520
<font color="yellow">and send them to prison for a few years.</font>

719
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,250
<font color="yellow">They tried to...</font>

720
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,450
<font color="yellow">con me.</font>

721
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,620
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

722
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,580
<font color="yellow">it isn't as easy as it sounds.</font>

723
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:26,850
<font color="yellow">I can detain them for 48 hours,</font>

724
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,320
<font color="yellow">but not beyond then.</font>

725
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,230
<font color="yellow">He pretended to be a government official and caused our family harm.</font>

726
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,250
<font color="yellow">I am a government official...</font>

727
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,720
<font color="yellow">I know your daughter's statement is more reliable,</font>

728
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,680
<font color="yellow">but there was no exchange of money.</font>

729
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,220
<font color="yellow">Your daughter received a gift...</font>

730
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,380
<font color="yellow">that is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</font>

731
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,450
<font color="yellow">Yang Jung Do...</font>

732
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,820
<font color="yellow">is a VIP client at your son's company.</font>

733
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,980
<font color="yellow">That was to gain trust before committing the con.</font>

734
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,680
<font color="yellow">I know that. I do.</font>

735
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,650
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

736
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,050
<font color="yellow">there is no proof.</font>

737
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,020
<font color="yellow">I need proof that at least a dime changed hands...</font>

738
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,880
<font color="yellow">so that I can lock them up for fraud.</font>

739
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,620
<font color="yellow">I didn't receive anything from him.</font>

740
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,550
<font color="yellow">There is nothing...</font>

741
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,450
<font color="yellow">we can do right now.</font>

742
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,720
<font color="yellow">They may press charges against your children for fraud.</font>

743
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,420
<font color="yellow">That's actually easier...</font>

744
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,350
<font color="yellow">since there was a transfer of goods.</font>

745
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,450
<font color="yellow">What you're saying is...</font>

746
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,820
<font color="yellow">you can't help me, is that it?</font>

747
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,820
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm sorry, but...</font>

748
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,550
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

749
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,180
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

750
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,650
<font color="yellow">Pil Gyu.</font>

751
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,880
<font color="yellow">Pil Gyu.</font>

752
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,450
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

753
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,250
<font color="yellow">Right there.</font>

754
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,320
<font color="yellow">Should we eat first?</font>

755
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,450
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

756
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,450
<font color="yellow">That hit the spot.</font>

757
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,620
<font color="yellow">Will you go to Bang Ho Seok now?</font>

758
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,450
<font color="yellow">I should. What about you?</font>

759
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,180
<font color="yellow">I'll go to Bang Min A...</font>

760
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,550
<font color="yellow">and...</font>

761
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,350
<font color="yellow">to Bang Pil Gyu.</font>

762
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,060
<font color="yellow">- Okay. I'll see you later.
-  Okay.</font>

763
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,280
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you later.
-  Okay.</font>

764
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,150
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

765
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,150
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

766
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,850
<font color="yellow">Hi, Ms Bang. It's Choo Seok Hoon.</font>

767
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,250
<font color="yellow">I mean, Baek Sung Il.</font>

768
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,150
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'd like to talk to you about something in person.</font>

769
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,450
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

770
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,520
<font color="yellow">Yes. Can you connect me to him?</font>

771
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,820
<font color="yellow">Okay. Got it. Good luck.</font>

772
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,020
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

773
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,280
<font color="yellow">Jung Do is about to start for real now.</font>

774
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,450
<font color="yellow">Is he?</font>

775
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:00,980
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

776
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,220
<font color="yellow">I had something to tell you.</font>

777
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,220
<font color="yellow">What? Do you want the vase back?</font>

778
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,580
<font color="yellow">I'm not that low.</font>

779
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,380
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you just one last thing.</font>

780
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,350
<font color="yellow">Will you really...</font>

781
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,280
<font color="yellow">not pay your taxes?</font>

782
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

783
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,450
<font color="yellow">The taxes that your father owes.</font>

784
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,920
<font color="yellow">45.25 million dollars in national tax...</font>

785
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,350
<font color="yellow">and 4.52 million in local tax...</font>

786
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,450
<font color="yellow">for a total of 49.77 million dollars.</font>

787
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,410
<font color="yellow">Will you not pay that?</font>

788
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,120
<font color="yellow">Has this moron lost his mind?</font>

789
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,950
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

790
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,620
<font color="yellow">Don't you understand the situation?</font>

791
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,650
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

792
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:44,180
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm asking you nicely to pay your taxes.</font>

793
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,450
<font color="yellow">You rat.</font>

794
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,450
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're tough just because there was no proof on you?</font>

795
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,950
<font color="yellow">Do you think my dad will let you get away with it?</font>

796
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
<font color="yellow">You're so rude.</font>

797
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,520
<font color="yellow">Like father, like child.</font>

798
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,050
<font color="yellow">Lady. Don't you understand the situation?</font>

799
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,450
<font color="yellow">Did spending a few days at the precinct throw you off?</font>

800
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,050
<font color="yellow">She's so dense. How frustrating.</font>

801
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,420
<font color="yellow">Lady.</font>

802
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,550
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo didn't betray us.</font>

803
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:17,180
<font color="yellow">She went to you because she needed to borrow something.</font>

804
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,280
<font color="yellow">She wants to eat together to thank you for helping me.</font>

805
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,820
<font color="yellow">Hurry over.</font>

806
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:38,550
<font color="yellow">Now.</font>

807
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,050
<font color="yellow">- Ms Bang, please.
-  Leave her alone.</font>

808
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,980
<font color="yellow">- Let me leave.
-  Back off.</font>

809
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,120
<font color="yellow">That stupid pig is so strong.</font>

810
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,450
<font color="yellow">Drag them out of here!</font>

811
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,450
<font color="yellow">Take them!</font>

812
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,850
<font color="yellow">I have a boss named Commissioner Ahn at City Hall.</font>

813
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,820
<font color="yellow">He knew we were trying to con your father,</font>

814
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,720
<font color="yellow">so we beat him to the punch.</font>

815
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,680
<font color="yellow">We didn't have time to wait.</font>

816
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,350
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to the basement?</font>

817
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,120
<font color="yellow">The house was empty when you took us to the police.</font>

818
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,150
<font color="yellow">Come upstairs.</font>

819
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,680
<font color="yellow">They're gone.</font>

820
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,880
<font color="yellow">Move!</font>

821
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,950
<font color="yellow">Load them up.</font>

822
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

823
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,380
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

824
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,620
<font color="yellow">I think we're done.</font>

825
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,650
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

826
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,450
<font color="yellow">We liquidated everything in two days.</font>

827
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,620
<font color="yellow">It is nice. It's authentic.</font>

828
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,450
<font color="yellow">It happened while we were locked up,</font>

829
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,680
<font color="yellow">so you can't tie it to us.</font>

830
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,680
<font color="yellow">There's no proof, either.</font>

831
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,080
<font color="yellow">Now, do you feel like paying your taxes?</font>

832
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,320
<font color="yellow">Mr Choo.</font>

833
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,280
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

834
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,950
<font color="yellow">What must I do?</font>

835
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,450
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I...</font>

836
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,920
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

837
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

838
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,250
<font color="yellow">Let's be rational about this.</font>

839
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,250
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

840
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,820
<font color="yellow">If you would...</font>

841
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,450
<font color="yellow">put everything back to where it was,</font>

842
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,450
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 3 million. What do you say?</font>

843
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:58,420
<font color="yellow">Is that too little?</font>

844
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,980
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 5 million.</font>

845
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,720
<font color="yellow">That's good, right? I promise.</font>

846
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,650
<font color="yellow">I'll tell my dad.</font>

847
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,380
<font color="yellow">5 million.</font>

848
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,350
<font color="yellow">My wife runs a pork trotter restaurant.</font>

849
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,320
<font color="yellow">We do well enough to survive.</font>

850
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,850
<font color="yellow">We're fine.</font>

851
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,550
<font color="yellow">Then what should I do?</font>

852
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,010
<font color="yellow">What must I do?</font>

853
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,750
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek, what should I do?</font>

854
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,220
<font color="yellow">- Just say the word.
-  Call your father.</font>

855
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,950
<font color="yellow">I have nothing else to say to you.</font>

856
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,850
<font color="yellow">Call your father and give me the phone.</font>

857
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,350
<font color="yellow">Call him now!</font>

858
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,320
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

859
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,280
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

860
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,520
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

861
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
<font color="yellow">Bang Pil Gyu.</font>

862
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,120
<font color="yellow">You thought money would resolve everything.</font>

863
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,250
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

864
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,720
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

865
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,820
<font color="yellow">I'm Baek Sung Il from Seowon Taxation Office.</font>

866
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,250
<font color="yellow">You don't remember my name.</font>

867
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,180
<font color="yellow">You didn't remember my face, either.</font>

868
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,650
<font color="yellow">I saw you a few days ago and at Insa-dong, too.</font>

869
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,550
<font color="yellow">You said this six years ago.</font>

870
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,450
<font color="yellow">I owe nothing to the nation.</font>

871
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,920
<font color="yellow">The nation owes me.</font>

872
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:43,450
<font color="yellow">- You rat.
-  Shut it and listen, you rat.</font>

873
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,720
<font color="yellow">Why don't you owe the nation?</font>

874
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,420
<font color="yellow">What nonsense is that?</font>

875
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,450
<font color="yellow">Fine. Whatever.</font>

876
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:53,020
<font color="yellow">Say you owe the nation nothing.</font>

877
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,250
<font color="yellow">But you...</font>

878
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,820
<font color="yellow">For the rest of your life, you must compensate...</font>

879
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,780
<font color="yellow">the people who were hurt...</font>

880
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,880
<font color="yellow">because of you.</font>

881
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

882
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,450
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

883
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,920
<font color="yellow">help you fulfil your obligations.</font>

884
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,950
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

885
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,950
<font color="yellow">Bang Pil Gyu.</font>

886
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,180
<font color="yellow">The back taxes you owe.</font>

887
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,020
<font color="yellow">45.25 million dollars in national tax...</font>

888
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,090
<font color="yellow">and 4.52 million in local tax...</font>

889
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,280
<font color="yellow">for a total of 49.77 million dollars.</font>

890
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,150
<font color="yellow">You have paid it in full.</font>

891
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,090
<font color="yellow">You enjoyed all the luxuries,</font>

892
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,780
<font color="yellow">thinking you had authority because you had a father like him.</font>

893
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:13,780
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

894
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,620
<font color="yellow">fulfil your obligations...</font>

895
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,380
<font color="yellow">and live like a decent human being.</font>

896
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,350
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jung Do. I'm done.</font>

897
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

898
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,520
<font color="yellow">but I can't pay the taxes with this.</font>

899
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:56,320
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you talking about? Stop joking.</font>

900
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,090
<font color="yellow">No, I mean it. I do.</font>

901
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,380
<font color="yellow">I need to use it for something else.</font>

902
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,820
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use it. That's okay, right?</font>

903
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,650
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you talking about?</font>

904
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,650
<font color="yellow">Why would you use that money?</font>

905
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,980
<font color="yellow">Where... Where are you?</font>

906
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,020
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know that.</font>

907
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,720
<font color="yellow">I'll use it, okay?</font>

908
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,820
<font color="yellow">I did all the work anyway.</font>

909
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,120
<font color="yellow">Shut your trap!</font>

910
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,090
<font color="yellow">Jung Do.</font>

911
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,030
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything funny.</font>

912
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:37,090
<font color="yellow">You said you weren't lying to me.</font>

913
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,540
<font color="yellow">You said the detective was playing me.</font>

914
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,950
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

915
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,090
<font color="yellow">trust a con artist of all people?</font>

916
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:48,750
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the money.</font>

917
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,150
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hey!</font>

918
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,590
<font color="yellow">What will you do now?</font>

919
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,120
<font color="yellow">(Squad 38)</font>

920
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,150
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

921
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,750
<font color="yellow">There are too many tails to cut off.</font>

922
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,220
<font color="yellow">Me or the mayor...</font>

923
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,880
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

924
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,640
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

925
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,260
<font color="yellow">Where's Jung Do?</font>

926
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,440
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

927
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,860
<font color="yellow">Jung Do doesn't have the money.</font>

928
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,500
<font color="yellow">Ms Noh has it.</font>

929
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,980
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

930
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,700
<font color="yellow">Disband the tax collection team.</font>

931
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,100
<font color="yellow">Why did you betray us?</font>

932
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,090
<font color="yellow">Where's Jung Do?</font>

933
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,020
<font color="yellow">He may know.</font>

934
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,380
<font color="yellow">I'm on your side.</font>
