Hak Joo. Mi Joo.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,030
The pig.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,630
Even the idiot from City Hall.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,060
I arrested every one of them.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Too bad.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,690
You gave me a reason to come after you.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,730
Money didn't change hands. It doesn't constitute as...

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,760
No.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,130
I will let the others out after 48 hours.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,260
You and Jin Seok will sign those papers tomorrow.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,460
Take the contracts and do it yourself.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,990
The second you sign the papers,

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,990
I'll bring you in.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,990
I got you good,

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
didn't I?

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,000
So stop while you still can.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,160
I'm lecturing you for your own sake.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,260
I wouldn't be bothered to do this for my own son.

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,260
Okay. I'll go myself.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,860
I'll get Ma Jin Seok to sign the papers.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,260
You jerk.

25
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,030
Come after me.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,790
I'll keep running.

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,790
You just can't stop it.

28
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,630
Cuff yourself tomorrow when you see me.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,900
I'm too old for this.

30
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm too exhausted to even cuff you.

31
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,030
Darn it!

32
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,460
Mr Ma, it's me from Hwaseong City Hall.

33
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,560
Mr Park has an urgent issue to tend to.

34
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,860
I think I'll have to meet you in person.

35
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,330
Okay. Do you have time today?

36
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,260
(SQUAD 38)

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,890
- Let me see. You are bleeding.
- Excuse me.

38
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,490
Can I please talk to the person in charge?

39
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,490
There seems to be some misunderstanding.

40
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,730
Sung Il.

41
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,660
They're not after us.

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,760
They arrested us to catch Jung Do.

43
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,990
Jung Do will have to meet him himself because we're here.

44
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,330
This is a trap.

45
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,390
Gosh.

46
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,960
What if I tell you the truth?

47
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,690
It is true...

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,260
that Jung Do saved Chairman Wang's life...

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
twice.

50
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,060
I heard they were arrested.

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,230
- When?
- It's been about an hour.

52
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,930
So where is Jung Do now?

53
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,330
He's here.

54
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,330
He's really doing it today.

55
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,990
He can run, but he can't hide.

56
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,790
He is on the move. Make sure to put a tail on him.

57
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,790
The second they sign the papers,

58
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,060
cuff him in before the ink dries.

59
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,830
Do you understand?

60
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,700
I see Yang Jung Do passing by.

61
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,360
Hello? Okay.

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
He's got the papers.

63
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,260
Where is he going?

64
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,990
Stop.

65
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,160
Go.

66
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,690
Gosh.

67
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,790
Stop there!

68
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
Yang Jung Do!

69
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,690
Stop!

70
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,930
Stop right there.

71
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Chase him.

72
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,990
Yes, Sir.

73
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,990
Stop!

74
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,060
You jerk.

75
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,530
- Corner him.
- Yes, Sir.

76
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,990
Shoot.

77
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
Ma'am.

78
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,960
What is that?

79
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,830
Why are there two cars?

80
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,160
What are you talking about?

81
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Chase the car.

82
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,390
There are two same cars.

83
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,390
Whatever, just chase the car.

84
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Shoot.

85
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,530
Chase the car.

86
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,730
There are three of them now.

87
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,990
What should we do?

88
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,390
Go catch any one of them.

89
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,230
Where are you now?

90
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,830
Go to them.

91
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,130
Darn it!

92
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,760
What's your problem?

93
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,060
How could you miss him like that?

94
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,390
You fools.

95
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Ma Jin Seok.

96
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,390
Where is he now?

97
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,260
If you chase Ma Jin Seok, you can catch Yang Jung Do.

98
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,760
- Find him immediately.
- Sir.

99
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,730
Forget about Yang Jung Do. We should worry about what we did.

100
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,730
We just made a big mess outside of our jurisdiction.

101
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,030
What did you just say?

102
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,690
He didn't even commit a fraud yet.

103
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,230
If they find out that we did it out of speculation,

104
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,460
we'll get suspended.

105
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,590
Jerks.

106
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,060
Shoot.

(WANTED: DETECTIVE SA JAE SUNG)

108
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
What?

109
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,230
What is it?

110
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,130
Sorry, Sir.

111
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,360
Wait.

112
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,330
What are you doing?

113
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,860
Let go.

114
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,960
Come quietly.

115
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,690
Let go!

116
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,390
Let go of me.

117
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,490
Take him.

118
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,390
Guess why it's good to be rich.

119
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,960
You can buy many of these cars.

120
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,760
How did you find out?

121
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,690
Someone called my office.

122
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,260
He said the others were arrested...

123
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,290
but that you were being chased.

124
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,390
Who do you think called?

125
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,230
I don't know.

126
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,960
Are you sure?

127
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,560
How would I know?

128
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,960
I see.

129
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,660
I thought you knew.

130
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,330
If you find out later, do tell.

131
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,330
Hello?

132
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,060
Yes.

133
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
What?

134
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,430
Okay.

135
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,660
Are you Detective Kim Hong Gil?

136
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,190
Yes. I am.

137
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,560
Hello.

138
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,460
Shall we go?

139
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Pardon?

140
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,330
You must finish what you started.

141
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,830
- Right.
- Yes.

142
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
We should go.

143
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,460
Hi.

144
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,860
Hello.

145
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,960
Did I make you wait?

146
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
No.

147
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,390
Let's finish the deal.

148
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,660
- Here.
- Okay.

149
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,230
- Take your time.
- Sure.

150
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,930
Should I affix my seal?

151
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,960
Did you read it all?

152
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,030
Yes.

153
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,660
That's it, then.

154
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,960
Do you have the eight account numbers I gave you?

155
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,560
Wire the six million to those accounts.

156
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Sure.

157
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,260
Just a moment.

158
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,660
It's me.

159
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,160
Transfer the money.

160
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,690
It's on.

161
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,830
I'm here.

162
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll call in a bit.

163
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,490
It shouldn't be a minute.

164
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
Okay.

165
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,160
So, Mr Kim.

166
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Can I make you an offer?

167
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,830
Sure.

168
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,860
I promised Mr Baek...

169
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,360
a five percent commission.

170
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,430
But I just realised that he didn't do anything.

171
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,190
You did all the work, didn't you?

172
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,330
What are you trying to say?

173
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,060
If I give Mr Baek five percent,

174
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,290
you and he must share it.

175
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,930
2.5 percent each, right?

176
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,690
How about I just...

177
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,660
give you three percent instead?

178
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,560
Let's do that...

179
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,360
and cut Mr Baek out of the deal.

180
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,330
Wouldn't that be nice?

181
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,030
Now we know each other, I can contact you directly.

182
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,460
- Gosh...
- You're scum to the last minute.

183
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,690
It's not like that.

184
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,290
- He said...
- Jin Seok.

185
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,390
What?

186
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,560
You just got conned.

187
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,290
What do you mean?

188
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,760
You got conned, you moron.

189
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,230
The land you just paid over six million for.

190
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,060
Guess how much it really is.

191
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,560
It's 10 dollars per Pyeong.

192
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,660
It's not good for anything because it's part of the greenbelt.

193
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,660
You aren't making any sense.

194
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,930
Jung Do, he won't believe me.

195
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,660
You love checking cadastral maps.

196
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,590
Go online and check the appraised value.

197
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,430
Hwaseong, Bongpyeong-eup Hwado-ri 23-1.

198
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,260
- Look it up.
- What?

199
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,760
Mr Kim.

200
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm not Mr Kim.

201
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm Mr Yang.

202
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,560
Over there.

203
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,160
Look it up.

204
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,060
You crazy...

205
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,130
- It's mine.
- Sit back.

206
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,060
(CADASTRAL MAP SEARCH)

207
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,500

(APPRAISED VALUE: 10 DOLLARS 20 CENTS)

209
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,190
- You look like you're doing fine.
- Do I?

210
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,230
Sorry.

211
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Jin Seok.

212
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Don't wire the money.

213
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,060
- What?
- Don't transfer the money!

214
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,160
Don't do it! Don't do it!

215
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Freeze!

216
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,460
Where's the money?

217
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
Where is it?

218
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,030
Gone. I wired it.

219
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,590
What?

220
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,860
- Cancel it.
- Let go of me.

221
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,430
Cancel the transfer!

222
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,360
I've never seen you make that face.

223
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,290
Six million must be a huge amount.

224
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,390
The lady you told to drink water.

225
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,330
She made the exact same face.

226
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,190
Do you see how she felt?

227
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,390
You should never use money to toy with others.

228
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,960
- Okay?
- Mr Baek.

229
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,030
Help me out here.

230
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,590
Mr Kim.

231
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,030
I'm really sorry.

232
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,960
You can't do this.

233
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,160
You know...

234
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,260
I worked hard to save up.

235
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,690
How dare you!

236
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,760
Help me out here. This will kill me.

237
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,430
Mr Baek.

238
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,390
I worked so hard for that money.

239
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,460
You scumbag!

240
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,960
You good for nothing jerk!

241
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,290
Oh, hello, Mr Ma.

242
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,330
You look very angry.

243
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,560
Is he the one who didn't pay up?

244
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,960
You're all frauds.

245
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,190
You picked on the wrong person.

246
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,960
I'll put you all behind bars.

247
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,760
Calling the police won't help.

248
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
- Sit and listen.
- What?

249
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,030
Sit down, you jerk!

250
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,500
Listen to me very carefully.

251
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,760
520,000 in local tax.

252
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,860
5.25 million in national tax.

253
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,960
You owed a total of 5.77 million in back taxes.

254
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,560
That's now paid in full.

255
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Jin Seok.

256
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,660
From now on,

257
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,660
try to be decent.

258
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,190
We shouldn't be an embarrassment to our own children.

Those jerks.

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,360
Hello, this is Seowon City...

262
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,130
Pardon?

263
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,560
Okay, thanks.

264
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,930
(PAID)

265
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,160
Sir, Ma Jin Seok just paid his back taxes.

266
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
What?

267
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,560
(MA JIN SEOK, CURRENT AMOUNT IN ARREARS: 0)

268
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,490
Hello?

269
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,390
What?

270
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,260
Mr Ahn.

271
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,660
Mr Ma Jin Seok just paid his taxes.

272
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
How much?

273
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
All of it.

274
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,130
I called the National Tax Service...

275
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,930
and he paid the 5.25 million off.

276
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,260
That's great.

277
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
So,

278
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,490
why do you look so upset?

279
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,460
It's nothing, Sir.

280
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,190
Thank you. You can leave.

281
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,360
Ma Jin Seok...

282
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,960
is one of Bang Pil Gyu's collaborators.

283
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,760
I was shielding him so as not to upset Mr Bang.

284
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,730
Whose case was it?

285
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,860
Mr Baek's of Taxation Office Division Three.

286
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,190
He's a big man with almost no guts,

287
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,260
so I didn't think he'd do much damage.

288
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,390
I don't know why,

289
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,060
but he's been really trying to get his claws into Mr Ma.

290
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,190
Ma Jin Seok, Bang Pil Gyu, Choi Chul Woo.

291
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,390
If these three go down, we will suffer as well.

292
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,360
Do you think...

293
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,660
they'll get to Mr Bang as well?

294
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,290
Bang Pil Gyu is 58 years old.

295
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,130
I'm sure you heard of Woohyang Group, a company that guaranteed...

296
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,060
a 250-percent profit...

297
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,560
that turned out to be a pyramid scheme.

298
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,790
Woohyang Construction is a subsidiary.

299
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,190
Bang Pil Gyu is the CEO.

300
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,490
Do you call this a proposal?

301
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,260
- Do you?
- He's Choi Chul Woo's friend...

302
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,760
and worked as his right hand man...

303
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,760
since the company's expansion in 2002.

304
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,890
Since Woohyang's bankruptcy, Bang Pil Gyu owes...

305
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,160
45.25 million dollars in national tax...

306
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,760
and 4.52 million dollars in local tax.

307
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,030
That's a total of 49.77 million dollars.

308
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,730
Why are you going after him?

309
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,930
We can't get him to pay up this much money.

310
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,860
This is a long term project...

311
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,990
It's to save Mr Baek.

312
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,810
Why are you going after him?

313
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,010
We can't get him to pay up this much money.

314
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,910
This is a long term project...

315
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,110
It's to save Mr Baek.

316
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,210
Once Pil Gyu is caught,

317
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,310
Sung Il won't have to be suspended.

318
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,080
- How?
- TV cameras.

319
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,380
If we were to visit him with cameras rolling,

320
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,810
what would the media report?

321
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,010
We'll use public sentiment.

322
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,610
The rich fear that more than our seizure stickers.

323
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,280
We'll take down Bang Pil Gyu who has direct ties to Ma Jin Seok.

324
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,010
Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs because of him.

325
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,740
- Can you explain?
- Say something.

326
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,010
Do you admit it's true?

327
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,680
He transferred his assets to his kids,

328
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,580
didn't pay millions in tax,

329
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,440
and yet he still lives in a huge mansion and eats good food.

330
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,380
Let the media catch wind of that.

331
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,810
The National Tax Service will be forced to take action,

332
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,180
and Ma Jin Seok, along with Bang Pil Gyu...

333
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,640
will take a hit.

334
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,080
We'll use Bang Pil Gyu to cause a media frenzy.

335
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,710
When Ma Jin Seok gets cold feet,

336
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,110
we'll get him for bribery and assaulting Mr Baek...

337
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,440
and take him down, is that it?

338
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,940
That's it.

339
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,540
It was my idea. I still have it, don't I?

340
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,380
To be honest,

341
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,740
this isn't like any other job we did before.

342
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Our goal is to use their weaknesses and offer a deal.

343
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,480
Ma Jin Seok will never pay his taxes,

344
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,740
so we'll turn the media against him.

345
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,110
Let's help Mr Baek.

346
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,710
Mr Kang, how many cameras will there be?

347
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,580
We're going to visit Bang Pil Gyu, the CEO of Woohyang Construction.

348
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,580
Yes, see you there.

349
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Three national TV channels, the cable news channels,

350
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,380
and some local channels.

351
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,110
Hello, Mr Lee.

352
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,710
They can't refuse a story like this one.

353
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,110
They're all waiting for us there.

354
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,710
Shall we get going, then?

355
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,810
Let's go.

356
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,110
- Are you wearing makeup?
- What?

357
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,480
My wife did it for me in case I appear on TV.

358
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,210
How do I look?

359
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,210
You look fine.

360
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,110
- You look 10 years younger.
- Do I?

361
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,510
Let's go.

362
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,210
Mr Park.

363
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,010
Yes?

364
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,910
Go and work instead of wasting your time here.

365
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,380
It's not that easy.

366
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,010
I think Sung Hee should take the lead on this one.

367
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,910
Be nice, Division Two.

368
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,710
Is this in case it backfires?

369
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,640
Don't worry about the cameras.

370
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,410
Just do what you always do.

371
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,810
- Good point.
- Okay.

372
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,310
- Let's study his house.
- Okay.

373
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,740
There are two floors.

374
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,580
It's in his son, Ho Seok's name.

375
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,380
Division 2 will take the 1st floor, Division 3 will take the 2nd floor.

376
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,710
- Will that do?
- Yes.

377
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,180
There's a brick wall on either side of the gate.

378
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,410
I think it's about 5m high.

379
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,540
The trees in the garden obstruct the view into the house.

380
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,710
It's your typical rich man's house.

381
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,310
If you enter through the main door, you'll see three rooms.

382
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,410
The first room is Bang Pil Gyu's study.

383
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,710
Leave the books alone...

384
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,910
and target the antiques and ceramic vases.

385
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,940
You do that, Sang Hee.

386
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,440
If you don't find anything,

387
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,910
leave the room and help out in one of the others.

388
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,740
Don't waste time in there.

389
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,940
Okay.

390
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,710
The second room.

391
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,740
It's the housekeeper's room, so let's skip it.

392
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,040
I'd like the rest of Division 2 to focus on the 3rd room.

393
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,780
What is it?

394
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,710
The dressing room.

395
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,010
Designer brand bags, clothes and watches.

396
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,410
Mark everything you can find.

397
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,510
If possible, make a scene in this room.

398
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,980
What kind of scene?

399
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,410
A fight.

400
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Not that.

401
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,040
Fight over a bag from a brand that everyone will recognise.

402
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,110
If you were to do that,

403
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,140
and that were to air on TV,

404
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,040
we should get the media on our side.

405
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,110
We can drop some hints and give them a show.

406
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,810
That should work for us.

407
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,740
The reporters will get everything,

408
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,910
so don't push too hard. Consider it a gentle massage.

409
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,240
- You're good at that.
- Don't you worry.

410
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,980
Now for the second floor.

411
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,710
There's a hallway and two rooms.

412
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,510
Room four, the master bedroom.

413
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,940
Inside the closet should be important papers,

414
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
jewellery and precious metals.

415
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,040
Mark everything down and hold them up for the cameras.

416
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,140
Okay.

417
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,380
Open that up.

418
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,710
Here you go.

419
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,710
Room five is the most important one.

420
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,010
Bang Pil Gyu owns this one.

421
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,980
It's always locked,

422
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,340
and you can't get in without a key.

423
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,810
Even his wife has never been inside.

424
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,710
I bet it's in this room.

425
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,410
- Right.
- The safe.

426
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,040
What's inside that safe...

427
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,340
and how we get it out...

428
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,440
will determine the result of this raid.

429
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,240
Mr Kim and I will take this room.

430
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Dong Soo, you help out wherever help is needed.

431
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,310
Mr Kang, can you brief the photographers?

432
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,510
I will.

433
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,310
We're going up against Woohyang Group's CEO.

434
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,880
Let's do this.

435
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,410
Good luck.

436
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,110
- Good luck.
- Go.

437
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,180
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

438
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,610
The Prosecutors' Office...

439
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,510
vowed to make this incident a turning point.

440
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,910
Now the weather.

441
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,880
Typhoon Bolaba is moving north fast.

442
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,910
At 3am on the 21st, it was located at sea,

443
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,980
560km to the northeast...

444
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,080
of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.

445
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,880
It's expected to change direction as it passes Taiwan,

446
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,380
and will head toward Korea and Japan.

447
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,210
If this typhoon makes landfall on Korea,

448
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
experts say it could cause more damage than...

449
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,840
the disaster caused by typhoon Bompass...

450
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,610
just six years ago.

451
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,540
Let's do this.

452
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,940
Thank you for coming all this way.

453
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,610
We're from Seowon City's Taxation Office,

454
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,510
and we're here to urge Bang Pil Gyu...

455
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,310
to pay his back taxes.

456
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,780
Please film what you see and report the truth.

457
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,310
Thank you.

458
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,240
Get the ladder.

459
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,350
Hey.

460
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,010
What if we go in and no one's there?

461
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm sure someone's inside.

462
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,610
What if you're wrong?

463
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,350
We'll be embarrassed in public.

464
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,610
Don't worry, someone's in.

465
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,880
Get the ladder.

466
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,710
- Get it.
- Okay.

467
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,540
This looks dangerous.

468
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,380
This is just part of how we do things.

469
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,510
All this is legal, so don't worry.

470
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,710
Be careful.

471
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,010
Hold on tight.

472
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,540
We got you.

473
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,410
Are you okay?

474
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,110
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

476
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,710
We're from Seowon City Hall. Open the door.

477
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,510
Is the house empty?

478
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,810
The ladder.

479
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,350
The ladder?

480
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,850
What if the house really is empty?

481
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,110
It's not. I'm positive.

482
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,010
It'll be so embarrassing if you're wrong.

483
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,710
- All these cameras...
- Don't worry. He's in there.

484
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,180
Excuse me.

485
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,880
Sung Hee, there are people inside.

486
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,080
Let's get the door.

487
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,380
Okay.

488
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,510
- Hurry.
- This is also...

489
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,540
a part of the process.

490
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,810
Go on, then.

491
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,980
Be careful.

492
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,310
We can go in now.

493
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,240
Mr Park, Chang Ho, go upstairs.

494
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,350
Okay.

495
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,540
Hello? We're from Seowon City Hall.

496
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,080
- I...
- Hang on.

497
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,080
What did you say your name was?

498
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,610
It's been a while, hasn't it?

499
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,510
Sung Hee.

500
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Seowon City Hall's Taxation Office. Are you Mr Bang Pil Gyu?

501
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,510
I was expecting your visit.

502
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,180
Have you eaten?

503
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,310
You shouldn't skip meals. You do a tough job.

504
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,940
We're here today because you owe...

505
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,910
45.25 million dollars in national tax,

506
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,610
- and local tax...
- 4.52 million dollars.

507
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,710
The grand total is 49.77 million dollars.

508
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,210
Today, you want to collect the 4.52 million dollars.

509
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,850
To seize my belongings.

510
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,180
Yes. I'm glad you're up to speed.

511
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,080
- According to...
- I believe it's Article 131.

512
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,010
House search and personal distress.

513
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,610
Go ahead.

514
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,910
But before you do,

515
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,380
let me say one thing.

516
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,280
This is the reason I didn't pay my taxes.

517
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,440
I wanted to meet with the press.

518
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,210
When else would I get...

519
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,080
a chance to explain myself to the public?

520
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,610
I lost my company because people said I was a fraud.

521
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,010
Now I'm penniless and can't afford to pay any tax.

522
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,310
Aren't I?

523
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,080
Woohyang Group...

524
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,110
was sacrificed...

525
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,180
in a witch hunt carried out by the previous president,

526
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,710
police and prosecution.

527
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,080
Our business model...

528
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,710
was about sharing purchasing experiences.

529
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,850
It was a legal pyramid business...

530
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,710
and we broke no law whatsoever.

531
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,810
Just because a company with sales of over two billion a year...

532
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,710
refused to pay a single penny in bribes to any official,

533
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,640
we became a target.

534
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,210
The government tagged us an illegal pyramid conning scheme,

535
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,280
and tore us apart.

536
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,780
I think this is about to turn political.

537
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,110
I tried...

538
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
to protect the company...

539
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,780
to the very end.

540
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,510
We supported 200,000 employees and their families.

541
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,310
I tried to protect them as best I could.

542
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
I'm so sorry.

543
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,180
I owe those 200,000 people a debt I cannot repay.

544
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,610
I will carry the guilt...

545
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,710
for the rest of my life.

546
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,010
I am very sorry.

547
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,180
You can begin.

548
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,110
Look around.

549
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,210
Let's do it.

550
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,710
Well... Go ahead.

551
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,710
Yes, Sir.

552
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,210
All right.

553
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,850
Please inspect the second floor.

554
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,940
- Chang Ho.
- Yes.

555
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Search the dressing room.

556
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,440
- Sir. I found it.
- Yes.

557
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,480
- There it is.
- Yes.

558
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,610
- Seize it.
- Yes, Sir.

559
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,110
Excuse me. Please cut us some slack.

560
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,640
I'm sorry. We have to execute it as we're told.

561
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,850
This is a gift from our daughter-in-law.

562
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,640
- Well... Sir.
- Please forgive us.

563
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,880
We're following the procedure. Please cooperate.

564
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,910
I'm so sorry.

565
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,940
Please cooperate.

566
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Just give it to them.

567
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,810
This is something we should do for our country.

568
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,910
We should expiate our guilt.

569
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,210
My daughter-in-law gave me this as a birthday gift last year.

570
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,980
Because of my incompetence,

571
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,410
we're living in my son's house.

572
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,440
I feel bad for my wife.

573
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,980
Let's go.

574
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,480
Was the watch really a gift?

575
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,080
Tell us how you feel.

576
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
It's okay.

577
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Is it not here?

578
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,740
This room is almost empty.

579
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,680
I think they moved it to somewhere else already.

580
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,540
Chief. There is nothing here.

581
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
Officer Kim.

582
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,610
You didn't find anything, did you?

583
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,780
No.

584
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,680
We're in trouble, aren't we?

585
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,540
We are.

586
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,680
I don't think he even cares about what we're doing.

587
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,350
We should shake things up a little.

588
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,240
That was a gift.

589
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,410
Could you open the door of the room on the second floor?

590
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,280
That room is empty.

591
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,880
That's something we have to check.

592
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
Open it, please.

593
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,810
All right.

594
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,810
It's a safe.

595
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Open it, please.

596
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,040
I only have a personal item in there.

597
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,980
I can't wait to see what it is.

598
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
Open it, please.

599
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,110
Must you do this?

600
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,680
Yes. It's our job to do this.

601
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,410
Do you want me to call a technician and get it open?

602
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,580
It may damage your safe.

603
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,910
It must cost a few hundred thousands dollars.

What is your name, Inspector?

606
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,710
I'm from Taxation Office Division Three of Seowon City Hall.

607
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,540
My name is Chun Sung Hee.

608
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,810
I'll remember that name.

609
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,140
What is it?

610
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,560
What is your name, Inspector?

611
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,860
I'm from Taxation Office Division Three of Seowon City Hall.

612
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,690
My name is Chun Sung Hee.

613
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,960
I'll remember that name.

614
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,260
What is it?

615
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,160
They say you never understand your parents until you become one.

616
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,790
As I get old, I miss my father.

617
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,660
That picture is all I have.

618
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,830
That's the only thing I can look at when I miss my late father.

619
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,330
Ms Chun.

620
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,330
Why did you come...

621
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,860
to my house today?

622
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,560
Are you here to collect taxes,

623
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,260
or to put on a show?

624
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,030
If you went through all this...

625
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,390
just to put on a show,

626
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,730
I'll be generous and let this one go.

627
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,590
But...

628
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,860
if you really came to collect taxes,

629
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,790
you're about to be in big trouble, Ms Chun.

630
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,290
I'll ask you again.

631
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,990
Did you come here to collect taxes,

632
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,960
or to put on a show?

633
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,330
I came here to work.

634
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,590
I got it. You can go now.

635
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,490
- Hello?
- Dad, I'm in trouble.

636
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,230
Ma Jin Seok, that jerk...

637
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,830
Where is he now?

638
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,330
What did you just say?

639
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,730
I said Ma Jin Seok has paid off his tax arrears.

640
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,260
What's happening, Sung Hee?

641
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,490
Why would he...

642
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,530
pay his tax arrears all of a sudden?

643
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,230
Gosh, you startled me.

644
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,890
I came to see Sung Il.

645
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,060
You and Chief did it, right?

646
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,030
- Did what?
- Ma Jin Seok's back taxes.

647
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,090
You and Chief conned him and made him pay.

648
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,630
You and I are always at odds.

649
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,730
Because Ma Jin Seok paid his taxes,

650
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,030
there's no way we can save Chief.

651
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,430
He would have to admit charges of assault and bribery.

652
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,060
- What are you talking about?
- We were going to make a deal.

653
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,660
For clearing Jin Seok's back taxes,

654
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,390
we were going to ask Chief's job in return.

655
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,430
We wanted to clear his assault charge and...

656
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,760
erase the record of the report that says he took bribes.

657
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,490
But we can't do that anymore.

658
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,690
Jin Seok wouldn't help someone who conned him and made him pay taxes.

659
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,990
I don't understand.

660
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,790
What you said is news to me.

661
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,230
I'm saying Disciplinary Committee is going to dismiss him.

662
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,830
You're not going to jail because you made him pay his taxes, right?

663
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,990
I heard that's what he promised you.

664
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,430
Congratulations.

665
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,660
But we can't save our chief now.

666
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,960
Now, let's move on to the next story.

667
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,190
Seowon City has declared that they will increase...

668
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,030
the reward for reporting concealment of assets...

669
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,430
from 30,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars.

670
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,790
Moreover, they will designate an inspector...

671
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,090
to every upper-class family and celebrity with high tax arrears...

672
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,060
and closely manage their tax payment.

673
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,860
Ji Eun, bring me canned coffee.

674
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,960
- Okay.
- Seowon City renewed...

675
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,890
the Act on Tax Arrears...

676
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,430
- with the changes.
- Dad, should I bow as well?

677
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,790
- Tax arrears have increased...
- No, it's fine. Turn down the TV.

678
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,860
- since 2016.
- Stop giving him coffee.

679
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,330
His teeth turned yellow and he didn't feel good because of coffee.

680
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,830
- He used to like it. It's okay.
- A police officer...

681
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,230
who aided, abetted and took bribes...

682
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,890
from fraudsters got arrested.

683
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,260
He's not my brother. He's my enemy.

684
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,790
Because of him,

685
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,090
I married someone so dumb.

686
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,160
Mother might hear you. Keep it down.

687
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,190
She's asleep.

688
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,690
Also, she agreed that...

689
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,830
you're foolish like a bear.

690
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,830
You said you like big guys.

691
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,060
You said I'm your ideal type.

692
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,290
Ji Eun, your mum is a strange woman.

693
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,530
Who is it at this hour?

694
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,590
I didn't know there was...

695
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,260
someone so handsome among his subordinates.

696
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,230
Are you married?

697
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,130
Not yet.

698
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,390
How about a girlfriend?

699
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,660
- I don't have one yet.
- I see.

700
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:15,160
How about someone you flirt with?

701
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,490
I don't have that one, either.

702
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,230
Then, would you like to go on a blind date?

703
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,560
- There are so many...
- My goodness.

704
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,530
let him have his meal in peace.

705
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,490
Why did you invite him for dinner? You should've just let him go.

706
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,490
Why are you getting upset?

707
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,630
You often get cranky these days.

708
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,760
I'm not being cranky. I'm just saying you should let him eat.

709
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,290
Eat.

710
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,090
It's okay.

711
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,360
I already had dinner, so I'm not that hungry.

712
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,290
Eat up.

713
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:55,990
How old are you?

714
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,260
I'm in the first grade in high school.

715
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,130
How old does it make you?

716
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,990
Count it yourself.

717
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,730
You're right. I can count it myself.

718
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,930
You're smart.

719
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,130
By the way, you're so pretty. You must be very popular at school.

720
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,160
You're a con man, aren't you?

721
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,830
What?

722
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,730
I'm not pretty. I'm just ordinary.

723
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,190
I'm not popular either.

724
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,360
Just eat your dinner.

725
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,490
Don't try to compliment just because I'm your boss' daughter.

00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,730
He's my wife's older brother.

730
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,790
It looked like he died young.

731
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,160
Why did he pass away?

732
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,230
He killed himself six years ago.

733
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,130
Why?

734
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:17,990
He was my co-worker.

735
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,630
We got a report that said he took bribes.

736
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,030
Anyway,

737
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,190
it gave him a hard time. That's what happened.

738
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,830
If only...

739
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,930
If I had believed him that once,

740
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,290
maybe he wouldn't have done it.

741
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,590
Do you know what the last thing I said to him was?

742
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,060
I told him to stay low.

743
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,490
I told him I wanted my pension.

744
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,260
He was thinking about ending his life,

745
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,430
and I said things like pension.

746
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,430
But...

747
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,430
did he really take bribes?

748
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,190
Maybe he disturbed someone he shouldn't have.

749
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,230
Woohyang.

750
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,590
He went up against Woohyang Group.

751
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,090
Choi Chul Woo, the president of Woohyang Group had...

752
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,760
the highest amount in arrears in Seowon City. He wanted to get him.

753
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,790
He started it because he was young and fearless.

754
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,730
We couldn't even get near Choi Chul Woo.

755
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,190
Because of Bang Pil Gyu, his right-hand man.

756
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,790
He had made so many allies inside City Hall.

757
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,660
We wanted to get Bang Pil Gyu and Choi Chul Woo together.

758
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,960
A phone call was made and we were done.

759
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,060
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

760
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,730
The next day, Commissioner Ahn wanted out.

761
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,160
I'm sorry, Min Sik. I'll help you out next time.

762
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,390
Baek Sung Il from Division One...

763
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,390
- left us as well.
- Sung Il.

764
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,260
A few days later, Noh Seung left.

765
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,530
Eventually, I...

766
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,460
Let's stay low.

767
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,860
I need to get my pension.

768
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,430
That led to his death.

769
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,230
That's how he passed away.

770
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:18,390
Then, who was the person...

771
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,760
that Bang Pil Gyu called?

772
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,260
He must've been someone in a high position.

773
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,260
That one phone call destroyed your division.

774
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,930
Just someone.

775
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,390
Come on. Who is it?

776
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,990
It's just someone.

777
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,830
Forget it. He's not your concern.

778
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,130
By the way, why did you visit me at this hour?

779
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,590
I didn't come here to see you.

780
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,160
It's not that.

781
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,560
Well...

782
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,160
Why didn't you tell me?

783
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,630
Tell you what?

784
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,760
About Disciplinary Committee. I heard you might get fired.

785
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,290
I'll have to wait and see.

786
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,690
Maybe I'll just get suspended.

787
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,890
With Ma Jin Seok's six million dollars in arrears,

788
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,590
didn't you think to make a deal with him?

789
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,560
You could've asked him to forget about...

790
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,290
the assault and bribes and you'll give him the money back.

791
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,790
What is that? That'd make me look bad.

792
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,190
I also made a promise to you.

793
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,930
Somehow,

794
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,790
I used violence,

795
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,790
but I never took bribes. So, I don't think I'll get fired.

796
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,660
I'll try to make it moderate as suspension.

797
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,790
I'll be great if you can make that happen.

798
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,130
But I don't think you can.

799
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,830
I'm just saying.

800
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,230
I have something to give you.

801
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,530
I'm not giving it to you now.

802
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,590
Sir, it's...

803
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,930
I got conned...

804
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,760
by swindlers.

805
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,590
- Then they used...
- Your money to pay taxes?

806
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,360
Yes, Sir.

807
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,530
All of that 5.7 million dollars?

808
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:37,330
Yes.

809
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:44,260
You think we're fools? You jerk.

810
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,030
Hey.

811
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,360
You.

812
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,430
Hit.

813
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,490
Hit yourself.

814
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,660
Harder.

815
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,860
Harder, I said.

816
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,660
Gosh.

817
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,330
Look at this jerk.

818
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,030
Hey.

819
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,330
Come on.

820
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,060
Raise your chin.

821
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,930
Let go. I said let go.

822
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,030
Ho Seok.

823
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,130
That's enough.

824
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,390
Gosh.

825
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:05,330
Jin Seok.

826
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,030
Yes, Sir.

827
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,460
Our calculation's done now.

828
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,260
- Pardon?
- Go back to where you belong.

829
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,330
Wait, Sir.

830
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,160
Please forgive me.

831
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:17,930
I'm sorry, Sir.

832
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,490
Please forgive me. My family will go completely broke.

833
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,290
You know it. Please don't do this.

834
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,790
You know how loyal I've been.

835
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,830
Please, just this once.

836
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,990
I'll do anything you ask. Anything, I promise.

837
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,360
- Jin Seok.
- Yes, Sir.

838
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,360
You thought you swam into the golden pond.

839
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,890
You thought you would never have to worry about money.

840
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
Jin Seok.

841
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,090
You know,

842
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,160
all the ponds in Korea have dried up.

843
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,560
No more golden ponds.

844
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,360
People like you...

845
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,860
should be grateful that you live near the golden ponds.

846
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,360
Go back to your league, the filthy brook.

847
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,630
Spend your days worrying about petty bills to pay.

848
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:07,590
Right.

849
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,260
Wrap up things here and his business.

850
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,590
- When should I do it?
- Now.

851
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,430
More people are out about in the afternoon.

852
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,660
Don't let the driver drive the car.

853
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:36,290
I'm sorry, Dad.

854
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,290
I'm still a terrible driver.

855
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,890
This jerk's a great one. He knows all the short-cuts.

856
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,660
- Did you just give me the look?
- No, Sir.

857
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:52,760
Focus on driving, you fool.

858
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,890
You would've lost your job long ago if you didn't drive well.

859
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,260
Driving is the only thing you're good at.

860
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,290
You're pathetic.

861
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:06,330
That's why your life is pathetic.

862
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,590
The only thing you're ever good at is driving, you fool.

863
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,890
Stop blabbering.

864
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,490
How did the thing go?

865
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,430
I've taken care of it and planned it out.

866
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,990
It will work out soon.

867
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:23,130
Those taxation office people must have pushed it hard this time,

868
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,630
seeing how you make me do such stuff.

869
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,490
They tried.

870
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,560
Those obnoxious jerks.

871
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,360
I have something to give you.

872
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,160
What brings you here?

873
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,590
I'm just here to say hello.

874
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,030
Where are you going?

875
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,560
Why? You don't like it?

876
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,030
Not exactly.

877
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,660
Must we do this?

878
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,090
It's not a must.

879
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,990
Don't you feel sorry for Mr Baek?

880
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,630
- Somehow, he ended up with us, - Hello.

881
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,360
but he's a person of justice.

882
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,360
Hi.

883
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,430
People like us.

884
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,590
We never cared about the law.

885
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,030
But this time, we worked towards abiding by the law.

886
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,490
This is...

887
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:03,030
the first time I had this feeling after our work was done.

888
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,560
Wasn't it fun?

889
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:11,230
Was it not, Ma'am?

890
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,960
So...

891
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,290
Why don't we help Mr Baek...

892
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,460
who made us realise we could do meaningful stuff?

893
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,060
What was it?

894
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,730
Article 38, Constitution of the Republic of Korea.

895
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,090
"All citizens shall have"...

896
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,360
"the duty to pay taxes"...

897
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,530
"under the conditions as prescribed by Act."

898
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:41,290
Just to abide by that, he joined hands with swindlers like us.

899
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,630
We can go back to where we belong,

900
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,190
but people like him should stay as just.

901
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,630
People like him are needed...

902
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,460
for justice to prevail.

903
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,360
This is all I had to say.

904
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,660
So,

905
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,190
who is in?

906
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,760
I'm here.

907
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,290
What... What is all this?

908
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:47,760
You caught us.

909
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,860
That's...

910
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:57,160
the list of tax in arrears your division is in charge of.

911
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,790
What are you going to do with that?

912
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,530
We'll stop your dismissal.

913
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:07,860
Will...

914
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,860
300 people's back taxes do?

915
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,860
(SQUAD 38)

916
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,560
This is Taxation Office.

917
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:02,460
The tax paid in the last few days adds up to 10 million dollars.

918
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,330
Set up a meeting with Bang Pil Gyu as soon as possible.

919
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:07,390
The one who doesn't know his place.

920
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,360
If you carry out one task for me,

921
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,660
I will cover up Mr Baek's case.

922
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,030
Is money everything?

923
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,830
Of course. It is in this country.

924
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:19,590
What's wrong with you?

925
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,530
You'll get released soon. I trust you.

926
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:24,030
You said this to my dad too, right?

927
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:25,130
You scum...

928
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:26,730
Don't give me a reason to go after you.
