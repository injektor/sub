00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,820
<font color="yellow">Please wait here for a few minutes.</font>

157
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,990
<font color="yellow">You will be sent home after writing a statement.</font>

158
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,560
<font color="yellow">I never told them my name.</font>

159
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,590
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

160
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,920
<font color="yellow">- Some crazy man...
-  Police.</font>

161
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,060
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hi.</font>

162
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,860
<font color="yellow">We received a report on fraud.</font>

163
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,060
<font color="yellow">- A fraud?
-  Yes.</font>

164
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,660
<font color="yellow">I don't know about that.</font>

165
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,530
<font color="yellow">Oh no.</font>

166
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,580
<font color="yellow">I guess you got a prank call.</font>

167
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,620
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

168
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,530
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

169
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,410
<font color="yellow">I will buy you a drink later.</font>

170
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,460
<font color="yellow">That's okay. Give me a call later.</font>

171
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,990
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

172
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,620
<font color="yellow">I will see you later.</font>

173
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,290
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

174
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,390
<font color="yellow">The car is here.</font>

175
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

176
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

177
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,020
<font color="yellow">Get in the car. We don't have much time.</font>

178
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,790
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

179
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

180
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,990
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

181
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,260
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

182
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,220
<font color="yellow">What is going on now?</font>

183
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,760
<font color="yellow">Well, it was a success.</font>

184
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,820
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
-  Give me your hands.</font>

185
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,800
<font color="yellow">I was startled. You should have told me sooner.</font>

186
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,890
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it fun?</font>

187
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,520
<font color="yellow">This is what fraud is.</font>

188
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,560
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

189
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,460
<font color="yellow">It was the perfect timing.</font>

190
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,260
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Okay.</font>

191
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,460
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that...</font>

192
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,290
<font color="yellow">I need to stay quiet to get my money back?</font>

193
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,800
<font color="yellow">You can't sue us as we don't leave any evidence behind.</font>

194
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,990
<font color="yellow">And a civil litigation...</font>

195
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,760
<font color="yellow">can't be an option as it will take forever.</font>

196
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,290
<font color="yellow">Let's take it easy.</font>

197
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,090
<font color="yellow">You should always put people before money.</font>

198
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,220
<font color="yellow">Don't you think?</font>

199
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

200
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,190
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

201
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,790
<font color="yellow">Chief!</font>

202
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,490
<font color="yellow">I will be back soon.</font>

203
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,660
<font color="yellow">Why do we have so many meddlers for this business?</font>

204
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,860
<font color="yellow">It's very distracting.</font>

205
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you not saying anything?</font>

206
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,320
<font color="yellow">I explained the whole thing.</font>

207
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,990
<font color="yellow">It's your turn to say something.</font>

208
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,660
<font color="yellow">Don't do it.</font>

209
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,990
<font color="yellow">Just stop what you are doing.</font>

210
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
<font color="yellow">I understand...</font>

211
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,090
<font color="yellow">it doesn't make sense to swindle tax out of a delinquent taxpayer.</font>

212
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,870
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd react so.</font>

213
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,190
<font color="yellow">It is not what public officials are supposed to do.</font>

214
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,880
<font color="yellow">- Sung Hee.
-  I'm not talking about...</font>

215
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,890
<font color="yellow">the law or your duty as a public official.</font>

216
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,690
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried that you'd get hurt.</font>

217
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,690
<font color="yellow">Don't do it.</font>

218
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,860
<font color="yellow">Ma Jin Seok is not worth risking your whole career.</font>

219
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,990
<font color="yellow">Chief.</font>

220
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,020
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

221
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,660
<font color="yellow">I manage to get all 5.77 million...</font>

222
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,260
<font color="yellow">that Ma Jin Seok owes the government?</font>

223
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,150
<font color="yellow">Can you stop?</font>

224
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,190
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee.</font>

225
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,570
<font color="yellow">Commissioner Ahn is covering for him.</font>

226
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,720
<font color="yellow">You can't make him pay up.</font>

227
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,690
<font color="yellow">Stop talking such nonsense.</font>

228
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,260
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

229
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,160
<font color="yellow">I'll make him...</font>

230
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,060
<font color="yellow">pay the 5.77 million.</font>

231
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee.</font>

232
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,020
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee.</font>

233
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
<font color="yellow">You can drink.</font>

234
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,090
<font color="yellow">I can now.</font>

235
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,890
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

236
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,690
<font color="yellow">When did you become a public official?</font>

237
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
<font color="yellow">You studied art.</font>

238
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,790
<font color="yellow">After what you did to me,</font>

239
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,990
<font color="yellow">I learned to hate abstract ideas.</font>

240
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,690
<font color="yellow">Public officials stick to the law.</font>

241
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
<font color="yellow">You seem close to your chief.</font>

242
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,960
<font color="yellow">He's an honest man.</font>

243
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,560
<font color="yellow">He's very different from you.</font>

244
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
<font color="yellow">That's why I like him.</font>

245
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,520
<font color="yellow">I'm lost for words.</font>

246
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,990
<font color="yellow">If...</font>

247
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,590
<font color="yellow">we meet again, even by chance,</font>

248
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,120
<font color="yellow">don't even say hi.</font>

249
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,730
<font color="yellow">You disgust me.</font>

250
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,730
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

251
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

252
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,490
<font color="yellow">Can you help me?</font>

253
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,890
<font color="yellow">Listen up.</font>

254
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,160
<font color="yellow">Ma Jin Seok.</font>

255
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,960
<font color="yellow">He owes the government a total of 5.77 million dollars,</font>

256
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,490
<font color="yellow">including 520,000 in local tax.</font>

257
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,620
<font color="yellow">We're going to get him.</font>

258
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,980
<font color="yellow">He's both tough and mean,</font>

259
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,070
<font color="yellow">so brace yourselves.</font>

260
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,060
<font color="yellow">He abuses his rights,</font>

261
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,090
<font color="yellow">and ignores his duties,</font>

262
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,190
<font color="yellow">and it's time we taught him a lesson.</font>

263
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,790
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
-  Let's go.</font>

264
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,360
<font color="yellow">Real estate fraud.</font>

265
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,520
<font color="yellow">We get the target to buy land...</font>

266
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,690
<font color="yellow">and we take the profit.</font>

267
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,920
<font color="yellow">Clamp all his cars.</font>

268
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,230
<font color="yellow">- I'll go inside.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

269
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,230
<font color="yellow">Get clamping.</font>

270
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,230
<font color="yellow">I need help over here.</font>

271
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,520
<font color="yellow">Here's our plan.</font>

272
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,060
<font color="yellow">It's simple.</font>

273
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,230
<font color="yellow">It's fraud. Why make it hard?</font>

274
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,730
<font color="yellow">We're here to see Mr Ma.</font>

275
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,190
<font color="yellow">Who is this Mr Ma?</font>

276
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,360
<font color="yellow">23-1 Hwado-ri, Bongpyeong-eup in Hwaseong.</font>

277
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,760
<font color="yellow">That's the plot we'll sell to Jin Seok.</font>

278
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,890
<font color="yellow">I know that Mr Ma...</font>

279
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,960
<font color="yellow">This is obstruction of justice.</font>

280
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,490
<font color="yellow">Open the door!</font>

281
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,590
<font color="yellow">- We can't get in.
-  Hey!</font>

282
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,820
<font color="yellow">- How's your shoulder?
-  Bad.</font>

283
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,420
<font color="yellow">16 acres worth 240,000 dollars.</font>

284
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,490
<font color="yellow">Say, for example, that I have a son who has a son.</font>

285
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,230
<font color="yellow">Call the police.</font>

286
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,010
<font color="yellow">- Call them!
-  Ma'am.</font>

287
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,690
<font color="yellow">We won't leave.</font>

288
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,730
<font color="yellow">We will take what your son owes.</font>

289
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,790
<font color="yellow">My son and I...</font>

290
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,570
<font color="yellow">If he has a son who has a son,</font>

291
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,860
<font color="yellow">that would be 500 to 600 years down the line.</font>

292
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,660
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

293
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,320
<font color="yellow">even after all that time,</font>

294
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,090
<font color="yellow">these 16 acres will never be redeveloped.</font>

295
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,090
<font color="yellow">We will sell this to our dear Mr Ma.</font>

296
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,120
<font color="yellow">That's our plan.</font>

297
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,590
<font color="yellow">- He's in the family portrait.
-  Right?</font>

298
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,320
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
-  How dare you.</font>

299
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,590
<font color="yellow">I think two large bills will cover...</font>

300
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,890
<font color="yellow">all the expenses needed to pull this off.</font>

301
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,660
<font color="yellow">Six million is the price.</font>

302
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,390
<font color="yellow">If this is to work,</font>

303
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,490
<font color="yellow">we need you to do well.</font>

304
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,860
<font color="yellow">Jin Cheol.</font>

305
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,730
<font color="yellow">Let us in.</font>

306
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,520
<font color="yellow">One whisper from you and men in bed...</font>

307
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
<font color="yellow">with a stroke jump up to buy land.</font>

308
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,420
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

309
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,790
<font color="yellow">Ms Noh, buy the land...</font>

310
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,300
<font color="yellow">and give him the bait.</font>

311
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,320
<font color="yellow">Mr Ma Jin Cheol?</font>

312
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,420
<font color="yellow">We know that your older brother transferred...</font>

313
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,220
<font color="yellow">some of his assets to you in 2009.</font>

314
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,990
<font color="yellow">Who did what?</font>

315
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,690
<font color="yellow">Did you see it happen? Did you?</font>

316
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,070
<font color="yellow">Spread rumours that this plot...</font>

317
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,120
<font color="yellow">is near an area that will be redeveloped soon,</font>

318
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,790
<font color="yellow">and that the profit will last him three generations.</font>

319
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,230
<font color="yellow">Then Jin Seok will come looking for you,</font>

320
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,790
<font color="yellow">and we will get to work.</font>

321
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,090
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

322
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,120
<font color="yellow">- Go.
-  Leave.</font>

323
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,190
<font color="yellow">Get out of here! Will you just get the hint?</font>

324
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,820
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Sung Hee.</font>

325
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,120
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

326
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
<font color="yellow">Mr Ma Jin Seok?</font>

327
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,020
<font color="yellow">I'm from Taxation Office Division...</font>

328
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

329
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,660
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

330
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

331
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,460
<font color="yellow">report you to the prosecutors.</font>

332
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,360
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to rot in jail for the rest of your life, pay up!</font>

333
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

334
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,690
<font color="yellow">I heard you planned something.</font>

335
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,720
<font color="yellow">With Jung Do.</font>

336
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,620
<font color="yellow">What are you scheming?</font>

337
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,440
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

338
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,710
<font color="yellow">I heard you planned something.</font>

339
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,740
<font color="yellow">With Jung Do.</font>

340
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
<font color="yellow">What are you scheming?</font>

341
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,280
<font color="yellow">Please help me, Sir.</font>

342
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,460
<font color="yellow">If we report him to the authorities,</font>

343
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,930
<font color="yellow">we can make him pay...</font>

344
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,790
<font color="yellow">There is a process to everything.</font>

345
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,460
<font color="yellow">If we were to ignore it like you do, nothing would work.</font>

346
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,890
<font color="yellow">You know me.</font>

347
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,860
<font color="yellow">I'll follow the protocol.</font>

348
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,660
<font color="yellow">But you ignored everything already.</font>

349
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,550
<font color="yellow">You went to see people who have nothing to do with this,</font>

350
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,060
<font color="yellow">clamped their cars, disrupted their businesses and caused a fuss.</font>

351
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,080
<font color="yellow">What protocol is there to keep now?</font>

352
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,130
<font color="yellow">Sir, I...</font>

353
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,090
<font color="yellow">I really need to make him pay up.</font>

354
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,830
<font color="yellow">I need your help. Please, Sir.</font>

355
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,860
<font color="yellow">Sung Hee.</font>

356
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,530
<font color="yellow">What you should be saying to me now...</font>

357
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,690
<font color="yellow">is not "I need your help" or "please".</font>

358
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,360
<font color="yellow">It's "I apologise."</font>

359
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,830
<font color="yellow">"It will never happen again."</font>

360
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,790
<font color="yellow">Do you get that?</font>

361
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,990
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

362
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,640
<font color="yellow">Split it up into eight separate plots.</font>

363
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,090
<font color="yellow">I'll wire you the fee right now. Bye.</font>

364
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,080
<font color="yellow">We purchased all 16 acres.</font>

365
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,160
<font color="yellow">You're good at what you do.</font>

366
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,190
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

367
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,230
<font color="yellow">I want out.</font>

368
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,690
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

369
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,230
<font color="yellow">A detective came by.</font>

370
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,790
<font color="yellow">He seemed to know all about what you did to Noh Deok Gi.</font>

371
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,890
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

372
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,150
<font color="yellow">if you quit on us now, we can't reel Jin Seok in.</font>

373
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,230
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can bring him in.</font>

374
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,430
<font color="yellow">Use Noh Deok Gi.</font>

375
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,930
<font color="yellow">He taught your target all about real estate.</font>

376
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,890
<font color="yellow">He can't act to save his own life.</font>

377
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,450
<font color="yellow">We can't use an outsider. He can jump ship at any time.</font>

378
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,290
<font color="yellow">Then close up shop.</font>

379
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,890
<font color="yellow">This one stinks.</font>

380
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,130
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

381
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,690
<font color="yellow">I have to go on.</font>

382
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,430
<font color="yellow">It's not on you.</font>

383
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,360
<font color="yellow">What's the real reason you're doing this?</font>

384
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,530
<font color="yellow">Why would a man like Chairman Wang...</font>

385
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,490
<font color="yellow">care for the likes of you?</font>

386
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,430
<font color="yellow">I have too many doubts.</font>

387
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,060
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

388
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,290
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

389
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,960
<font color="yellow">My ex-husband told me to date...</font>

390
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,360
<font color="yellow">a widower or a divorced man, but not a single man.</font>

391
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,560
<font color="yellow">Single men can't be trusted.</font>

392
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,390
<font color="yellow">You're like that.</font>

393
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,330
<font color="yellow">I can't see through you.</font>

394
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,360
<font color="yellow">The land is yours.</font>

395
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,790
<font color="yellow">Call it my farewell gift, corny as that is.</font>

396
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

397
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,260
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Sir.
-  You're at home.</font>

398
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,960
<font color="yellow">Wow, what a great view.</font>

399
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,290
<font color="yellow">If you found a place to stay,</font>

400
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,960
<font color="yellow">the least you could do is have me for a meal.</font>

401
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,390
<font color="yellow">Where are your manners?</font>

402
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,990
<font color="yellow">How do you pay rent?</font>

403
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,060
<font color="yellow">Did you buy the place?</font>

404
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,460
<font color="yellow">Why are you so quiet?</font>

405
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,300
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

406
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,230
<font color="yellow">you got your fangs...</font>

407
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,930
<font color="yellow">into an old land-crazy man.</font>

408
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,030
<font color="yellow">Is that how you could afford this place?</font>

409
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,350
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

410
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,790
<font color="yellow">Don't look so scared.</font>

411
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,060
<font color="yellow">How many large ones did you get?</font>

412
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,460
<font color="yellow">What on earth do you mean?</font>

413
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,700
<font color="yellow">Did I tell you not to do anything...</font>

414
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,890
<font color="yellow">to rouse my suspicions or not?</font>

415
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,030
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

416
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,690
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be like your father?</font>

417
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,690
<font color="yellow">Do you want to prove an apple doesn't fall far from the tree?</font>

418
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,090
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

419
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,890
<font color="yellow">Your dad was a corrupt cop,</font>

420
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,060
<font color="yellow">and you got into fraud as soon as you got out of jail.</font>

421
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,230
<font color="yellow">What kind of a mess is that?</font>

422
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,060
<font color="yellow">No family should be like that.</font>

423
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,460
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

424
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,830
<font color="yellow">If you're going to con someone, do it properly.</font>

425
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,140
<font color="yellow">Even if I were to lock you up, I wouldn't get much of a fanfare.</font>

426
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,330
<font color="yellow">You stole too little.</font>

427
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,530
<font color="yellow">You're a waste of space.</font>

428
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,590
<font color="yellow">Next time, do something big.</font>

429
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,260
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

430
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,090
<font color="yellow">I'll see to it that you stay in until you're 60.</font>

431
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,090
<font color="yellow">Like your dad did.</font>

432
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,160
<font color="yellow">I live in a rotten little apartment,</font>

433
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,730
<font color="yellow">and you have a nice flat.</font>

434
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,290
<font color="yellow">How much does a place like this cost?</font>

435
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,930
<font color="yellow">I have too many doubts.</font>

436
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,230
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why are you doing this?</font>

437
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,560
<font color="yellow">Ms Noh quit on us.</font>

438
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,190
<font color="yellow">We need a change of plan.</font>

439
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,830
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

440
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,830
<font color="yellow">We still need to reel Jin Seok in.</font>

441
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,790
<font color="yellow">Let's try something else.</font>

442
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,990
<font color="yellow">He likes to bet on golf, right?</font>

443
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,730
<font color="yellow">Hak Joo, did you check...</font>

444
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,860
<font color="yellow">the indoor golf place he goes to?</font>

445
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,760
<font color="yellow">Mecca Golf in Cheongsam-dong. Three times a week.</font>

446
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,760
<font color="yellow">Cheongsam-dong?</font>

447
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,360
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo, get a job there.</font>

448
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,160
<font color="yellow">(Part-timer wanted)</font>

449
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,290
<font color="yellow">When will you start?</font>

450
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,790
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I can start tomorrow.</font>

451
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,290
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang.</font>

452
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,860
<font color="yellow">The thing I asked for.</font>

453
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,660
<font color="yellow">These? We used those before.</font>

454
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,710
<font color="yellow">What are those?</font>

455
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,830
<font color="yellow">Remote controls.</font>

456
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,030
<font color="yellow">Remote controls?</font>

457
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,190
<font color="yellow">I'll explain it to you later.</font>

458
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,290
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

459
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,260
<font color="yellow">I'm here to check the system.</font>

460
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,390
<font color="yellow">Is that PC number seven?</font>

461
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,430
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

462
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,690
<font color="yellow">Look carefully.</font>

463
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
<font color="yellow">Press once for over par.</font>

464
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,130
<font color="yellow">Press twice for under par.</font>

465
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,030
<font color="yellow">Press thrice for a hole-in-one.</font>

466
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,390
<font color="yellow">Don't you forget it.</font>

467
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

468
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,090
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my swing?</font>

469
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,890
<font color="yellow">It went in. Oh, my gosh.</font>

470
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,290
<font color="yellow">- How did you do that?
-  I don't know.</font>

471
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,360
<font color="yellow">I was terrible until now.</font>

472
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,060
<font color="yellow">We have a caddie and remote control in place.</font>

473
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,260
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

474
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,060
<font color="yellow">we need a golfer.</font>

475
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,490
<font color="yellow">A golfer.</font>

476
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,360
<font color="yellow">A golfer.</font>

477
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

478
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,290
<font color="yellow">Have fun.</font>

479
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,290
<font color="yellow">Swing properly. You have to at least hit the ball.</font>

480
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,460
<font color="yellow">It's so small.</font>

481
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,260
<font color="yellow">It's tiny.</font>

482
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,690
<font color="yellow">Are you new here?</font>

483
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,060
<font color="yellow">We move into action as soon as the target appears.</font>

484
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,290
<font color="yellow">Wait until he speaks to you first.</font>

485
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,060
<font color="yellow">A conman isn't a lion. Be a crocodile. Wait for them.</font>

486
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,730
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

487
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,610
<font color="yellow">I got Albatross.</font>

488
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,690
<font color="yellow">- I didn't know it's possible.
-  It's amazing.</font>

489
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,560
<font color="yellow">- You did an amazing job.
-  Thank you.</font>

490
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,130
<font color="yellow">You must be thrilled.</font>

491
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,490
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

492
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's you.</font>

493
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,230
<font color="yellow">I wasn't expecting to see you here. How strange!</font>

494
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,830
<font color="yellow">I have bad eye sight. What a surprise!</font>

495
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,660
<font color="yellow">You look very awkward.</font>

496
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,690
<font color="yellow">Do you play golf?</font>

497
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,960
<font color="yellow">I thought you looked more like a pool person.</font>

498
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,260
<font color="yellow">Golf is a great hobby for every middle-aged man.</font>

499
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,930
<font color="yellow">A hobby? What a joke.</font>

500
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,930
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Just carry on.</font>

501
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,030
<font color="yellow">Just play with your own skills.</font>

502
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,060
<font color="yellow">You have to make him think you're a pushover.</font>

503
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,230
<font color="yellow">How is your daughter doing?</font>

504
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,790
<font color="yellow">The world has become so equal.</font>

505
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,060
<font color="yellow">Everyone plays golf these days.</font>

506
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,830
<font color="yellow">Kids with rich parents and kids with poor parents...</font>

507
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,790
<font color="yellow">study in the same classroom.</font>

508
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,790
<font color="yellow">Equality is not a good thing.</font>

509
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,190
<font color="yellow">Those stupid jerks...</font>

510
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,690
<font color="yellow">don't know their place.</font>

511
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure I can do this. I might make a mistake again.</font>

512
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,290
<font color="yellow">I'm not good at golf.</font>

513
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,030
<font color="yellow">I heard your nickname was Holiday Mother...</font>

514
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,160
<font color="yellow">because you're so ferocious.</font>

515
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,890
<font color="yellow">That's not...</font>

516
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,660
<font color="yellow">Imagine your daughter-in-law insults your son.</font>

517
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,860
<font color="yellow">People should know their place.</font>

518
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,360
<font color="yellow">All those poor jerks...</font>

519
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,790
<font color="yellow">who try to look rich.</font>

520
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,960
<font color="yellow">Once a beggar, always a beggar.</font>

521
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,390
<font color="yellow">That's how we feel about Ma Jin Seok.</font>

522
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,260
<font color="yellow">His money is not his. It's taxes.</font>

523
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,660
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't we be angry?</font>

524
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,990
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

525
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,930
<font color="yellow">He's not even paying taxes. He shouldn't show off his money.</font>

526
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,100
<font color="yellow">That's why you're angry.</font>

527
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,460
<font color="yellow">Will this do?</font>

528
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,260
<font color="yellow">Get your uniform dry-cleaned.</font>

529
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,730
<font color="yellow">Just follow your heart.</font>

530
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,190
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

531
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,730
<font color="yellow">You seem to be struggling.</font>

532
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,240
<font color="yellow">I guess both you...</font>

533
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,360
<font color="yellow">and your daughter are good for nothing.</font>

534
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,230
<font color="yellow">People should know their place.</font>

535
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

536
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
<font color="yellow">Ma Jin Seok.</font>

537
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,990
<font color="yellow">- Me?
-  Yes, you.</font>

538
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,730
<font color="yellow">You're a man. Why do you talk so much?</font>

539
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,630
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

540
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,960
<font color="yellow">Why don't you compete with me?</font>

541
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,290
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

542
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,460
<font color="yellow">Do you have any money to bet?</font>

543
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,990
<font color="yellow">You don't even have any money. Don't act up.</font>

544
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,060
<font color="yellow">I don't have much money,</font>

545
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,390
<font color="yellow">but I need a car.</font>

546
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,730
<font color="yellow">As I work for the government, I can't take bribes.</font>

547
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,330
<font color="yellow">I'd like to buy a car with your money.</font>

548
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,060
<font color="yellow">Are you in or not?</font>

549
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,300
<font color="yellow">What are you going to bet?</font>

550
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,330
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

551
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,790
<font color="yellow">Fine. If I lose,</font>

552
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,160
<font color="yellow">I'll give you up.</font>

553
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,490
<font color="yellow">I'll let you go. What do you say?</font>

554
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,730
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

555
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a public official. I don't lie.</font>

556
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,990
<font color="yellow">1,000 dollars per hole, deal?</font>

557
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,630
<font color="yellow">Deal.</font>

558
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

559
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,870
<font color="yellow">It's 1,000 per hole. Keep your words.</font>

560
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,930
<font color="yellow">Let's get to it.</font>

561
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,730
<font color="yellow">Nice shot.</font>

562
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,290
<font color="yellow">Nice shot.</font>

563
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,930
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

564
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,030
<font color="yellow">That's too bad.</font>

565
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,560
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

566
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,990
<font color="yellow">What were you trying to do?</font>

567
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,530
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

568
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,830
<font color="yellow">Nice shot.</font>

569
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,130
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

570
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,190
<font color="yellow">- It was too short.
-  Gosh.</font>

571
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,630
<font color="yellow">- That was close.
-  Gosh.</font>

572
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,630
<font color="yellow">You didn't get anything in.</font>

573
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

574
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,020
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

575
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,130
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

576
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,100
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

577
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,800
<font color="yellow">You look tired. Should we stop here?</font>

578
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,860
<font color="yellow">- Go on.
-  One more round? Okay.</font>

579
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,330
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

580
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,530
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

581
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

582
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,890
<font color="yellow">Nice shot.</font>

583
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,330
<font color="yellow">That was nice.</font>

584
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

585
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,730
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

586
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,530
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

587
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,330
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for something?</font>

588
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,560
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

589
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,460
<font color="yellow">Weren't you holding something?</font>

590
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,160
<font color="yellow">- No, I wasn't.
-  You weren't?</font>

591
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,190
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

592
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,560
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

593
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,790
<font color="yellow">Are you coming back?</font>

594
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,130
<font color="yellow">Let's call it a day.</font>

595
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
<font color="yellow">Hey. Be careful.</font>

596
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling bitter?</font>

597
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,560
<font color="yellow">I'll think of it as giving money to charity. It wasn't a lot anyway.</font>

598
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,560
<font color="yellow">That's good. Think of it as donating money to the government.</font>

599
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,730
<font color="yellow">Do you have any plans for tonight?</font>

600
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,990
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

601
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,160
<font color="yellow">Let me treat you to some drinks now that I won some money.</font>

602
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,460
<font color="yellow">I'm not much of a drinker.</font>

603
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,610
<font color="yellow">I can treat you to a meal, then.</font>

604
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,630
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the money back.</font>

605
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,710
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

606
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,160
<font color="yellow">I'm a public official.</font>

607
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,060
<font color="yellow">I don't feel good about taking your money.</font>

608
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,690
<font color="yellow">Let's have some nice dinner. We're like friends now.</font>

609
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,290
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you dinner and give you the money back.</font>

610
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,060
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

611
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,330
<font color="yellow">What a silly jerk.</font>

612
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,210
<font color="yellow">The difference in Seowon City's tax increase rates between...</font>

613
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,430
<font color="yellow">individuals and corporations, which are 122 percent...</font>

614
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,290
<font color="yellow">and 50 percent respectively, has evoked strong opposition.</font>

615
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,530
<font color="yellow">Seowon City is...</font>

616
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,360
<font color="yellow">Here's the report on the merger, Ma'am.</font>

617
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,590
<font color="yellow">I told you to talk in a casual way when we're alone.</font>

618
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,160
<font color="yellow">How can you not change for 10 years?</font>

619
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,490
<font color="yellow">Since it's a huge project, we should report directly to Chairman Wang.</font>

620
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,830
<font color="yellow">Should I schedule a visit?</font>

621
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,860
<font color="yellow">It reflects the increase in prices...</font>

622
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,200
<font color="yellow">and the change in the tax environment.</font>

623
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,230
<font color="yellow">Ji Yeon.</font>

624
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,500
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

625
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,060
<font color="yellow">Why do you think taxes go up every year?</font>

626
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,190
<font color="yellow">Would it be because the government is running out of money?</font>

627
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,760
<font color="yellow">They why did corporate and real estate tax go down?</font>

628
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,260
<font color="yellow">It's because the lawmakers are rich.</font>

629
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,590
<font color="yellow">Although I'm rich myself, this is not right.</font>

630
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,430
<font color="yellow">It's not fair.</font>

631
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,560
<font color="yellow">I promise that,</font>

632
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,760
<font color="yellow">with this enlarged city budget,</font>

633
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,660
<font color="yellow">I will carry out more realistic and active policies...</font>

634
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,030
<font color="yellow">for the citizens.</font>

635
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,160
<font color="yellow">The meat tastes great.</font>

636
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,430
<font color="yellow">You can eat it as soon as it browns.</font>

637
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,060
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating? It tastes great.</font>

638
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,490
<font color="yellow">I don't really like the person in front of me and the smell.</font>

639
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,990
<font color="yellow">You can't avoid the smell when you eat meat.</font>

640
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,490
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I can't do anything about the person, though. Try some.</font>

641
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,980
<font color="yellow">Enjoy it yourself.</font>

642
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,990
<font color="yellow">(Kim Sang Pil at Hwaseong City)</font>

643
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,960
<font color="yellow">(Kim Sang Pil at Hwaseong City)</font>

644
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,590
<font color="yellow">- Didn't you have something to say?
-  Please excuse me.</font>

645
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,960
<font color="yellow">I have to answer this call.</font>

646
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,390
<font color="yellow">That fatty.</font>

647
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,360
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Kim. Go ahead.</font>

648
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,760
<font color="yellow">I failed to get that money.</font>

649
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,090
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm interested...</font>

650
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,660
<font color="yellow">in the Hwaseong New Town thing.</font>

651
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,160
<font color="yellow">But I have no money saved up, and it's hard to get such big money.</font>

652
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,390
<font color="yellow">The money I can get is not enough.</font>

653
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm talking about the Hwaseong New Town thing.</font>

654
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,270
<font color="yellow">I understand that it's a great opportunity.</font>

655
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,850
<font color="yellow">If you invest now,</font>

656
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,160
<font color="yellow">you'll earn money that is worth dozens of cars, right?</font>

657
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,860
<font color="yellow">Cut out the nonsense!</font>

658
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about cars all of a sudden?</font>

659
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

660
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,980
<font color="yellow">Anyway, do let me know when something comes up.</font>

661
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,330
<font color="yellow">Who knows if I'll win the lottery?</font>

662
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,930
<font color="yellow">Say only what's necessary. Don't ramble.</font>

663
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,540
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

664
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,830
<font color="yellow">Let's drink together soon.</font>

665
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,960
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll talk to you later.</font>

666
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,690
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

667
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was an important call.</font>

668
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,790
<font color="yellow">Weren't you saying something?</font>

669
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,490
<font color="yellow">Let me fill your glass.</font>

670
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,830
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

671
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,190
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I overheard your conversation.</font>

672
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,790
<font color="yellow">It sounded like you got some useful information.</font>

673
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,530
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

674
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,080
<font color="yellow">Share it with me.</font>

675
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,290
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious.</font>

676
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,960
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

677
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,530
<font color="yellow">I know someone at Hwaseong City.</font>

678
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,980
<font color="yellow">I'm not supposed to tell anyone.</font>

679
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,890
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

680
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,990
<font color="yellow">You were going to say something. What about Hwaseong City?</font>

681
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,790
<font color="yellow">This is a sensitive matter.</font>

682
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,460
<font color="yellow">My friend might get in trouble if it leaks.</font>

683
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,520
<font color="yellow">I want to be careful.</font>

684
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,130
<font color="yellow">- I shouldn't...
-  Mr Baek. I'm a businessman.</font>

685
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,690
<font color="yellow">I understand the importance of secrecy.</font>

686
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,560
<font color="yellow">What about Hwaseong City?</font>

687
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,830
<font color="yellow">There's this man...</font>

688
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,390
<font color="yellow">who used to work with me and transferred to Hwaseong City.</font>

689
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,330
<font color="yellow">He works in the urban development now.</font>

690
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,480
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

691
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,030
<font color="yellow">And they're planning a major development.</font>

692
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,110
<font color="yellow">He's been persuading me to buy some land there...</font>

693
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,290
<font color="yellow">before the plan becomes official. He says the land price will leap.</font>

694
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,290
<font color="yellow">That's about it.</font>

695
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,730
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

696
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,060
<font color="yellow">What's the expected earnings rate?</font>

697
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,920
<font color="yellow">Five times.</font>

698
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,190
<font color="yellow">- Five times?
-  Yes.</font>

699
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,070
<font color="yellow">You're kidding me.</font>

700
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,060
<font color="yellow">What kind of investment gives you five times earnings?</font>

701
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,130
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

702
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,460
<font color="yellow">Take it or leave it. This is why I didn't want to tell you.</font>

703
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,190
<font color="yellow">He's my close friend. He works for the city. He knows this stuff.</font>

704
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,860
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

705
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,690
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the bathroom.</font>

706
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,030
<font color="yellow">(He went to make a call.)</font>

707
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,960
<font color="yellow">(He went to make a call.)</font>

708
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,050
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the bathroom.</font>

709
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,390
<font color="yellow">(He went to make a call.)</font>

710
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,320
<font color="yellow">(He went to make a call.)</font>

711
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,620
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

712
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,110
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jin Seok.</font>

713
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,350
<font color="yellow">I was about to call you.</font>

714
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,490
<font color="yellow">Have you heard anything about Hwaseong New Town?</font>

715
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,440
<font color="yellow">The expected earnings rate is five times, and I don't believe it.</font>

716
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,920
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

717
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,810
<font color="yellow">I had to pay a fortune...</font>

718
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,290
<font color="yellow">for that information.</font>

719
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,560
<font color="yellow">It's supposed to be a bonanza.</font>

720
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,080
<font color="yellow">It'll be a golden goose.</font>

721
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,290
<font color="yellow">Invest all you have.</font>

722
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,790
<font color="yellow">Once you do that,</font>

723
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,790
<font color="yellow">we'll sleep and live...</font>

724
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,560
<font color="yellow">all covered in money.</font>

725
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,620
<font color="yellow">Buy land there.</font>

726
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,350
<font color="yellow">If this works out,</font>

727
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,450
<font color="yellow">it'll change our lives.</font>

728
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,620
<font color="yellow">- Did you eat a lot?
-  Yes.</font>

729
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,850
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

730
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,720
<font color="yellow">Should I...</font>

731
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,840
<font color="yellow">invest in that?</font>

732
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

733
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,620
<font color="yellow">- You didn't believe it.
-  Gosh.</font>

734
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,150
<font color="yellow">I'll give you some money.</font>

735
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:51,890
<font color="yellow">Let's invest in it.</font>

736
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,750
<font color="yellow">I'll give you five percent...</font>

737
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,750
<font color="yellow">of the profits.</font>

738
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,250
<font color="yellow">Five percent?</font>

739
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,050
<font color="yellow">Five percent?</font>

740
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,050
<font color="yellow">Let me meet your friend at Hwaseong City.</font>

741
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,050
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

742
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,120
<font color="yellow">We'll go down to Hwaseong the day after tomorrow.</font>

743
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,390
<font color="yellow">Meet us there. I'll call you again.</font>

744
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,490
<font color="yellow">Mr Baek.</font>

745
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,220
<font color="yellow">Your case will go through the disciplinary committee next month.</font>

746
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,720
<font color="yellow">It'll be in two weeks. Why don't you take some time off?</font>

747
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,250
<font color="yellow">You haven't taken a vacation in a long time.</font>

748
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,450
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

749
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,850
<font color="yellow">Once the informant testifies regarding the bribery,</font>

750
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,290
<font color="yellow">I don't think it'll end with suspension.</font>

751
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,090
<font color="yellow">It's highly likely that you'll be dismissed.</font>

752
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,390
<font color="yellow">I know Ma Jin Seok told on me. What are you talking about?</font>

753
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,350
<font color="yellow">Who said Ma Jin Seok told on you? I didn't say that.</font>

754
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,620
<font color="yellow">When we were searching his house,</font>

755
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,250
<font color="yellow">was it you that tipped him off?</font>

756
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,420
<font color="yellow">It's been a while. How have you been?</font>

757
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,160
<font color="yellow">- They're searching your house.
-  Sorry?</font>

758
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,290
<font color="yellow">You better hurry home.</font>

759
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,150
<font color="yellow">You seemed very close to each other at the golf club.</font>

760
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,620
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure it was you.</font>

761
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,690
<font color="yellow">You're very imaginative.</font>

762
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,350
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel ashamed in front of your kids...</font>

763
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,550
<font color="yellow">of the way you live your life?</font>

764
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,950
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

765
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,950
<font color="yellow">My son loves me.</font>

766
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,090
<font color="yellow">I let him do whatever he wants.</font>

767
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,620
<font color="yellow">He can't hate me.</font>

768
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,720
<font color="yellow">Tae Wook.</font>

769
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,550
<font color="yellow">What happened to you?</font>

770
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,890
<font color="yellow">Worry about yourself.</font>

771
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going to dig into your bribery case...</font>

772
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,890
<font color="yellow">so that you won't be able to step into the city hall again.</font>

773
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,190
<font color="yellow">Just go home and take some rest.</font>

774
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:13,890
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

775
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,750
<font color="yellow">Think of what to do when you're fired, too.</font>

776
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,550
<font color="yellow">I think you'd make a great writer.</font>

777
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,990
<font color="yellow">I see you. I'll come down.</font>

778
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:47,860
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

779
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,590
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to come here. I might get in trouble.</font>

780
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,420
<font color="yellow">I was feeling impatient.</font>

781
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,190
<font color="yellow">Your friend at Hwaseong City.</font>

782
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,960
<font color="yellow">Can't we meet him today?</font>

783
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,050
<font color="yellow">Today?</font>

784
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,320
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

785
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,640
<font color="yellow">I'm working right now.</font>

786
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,950
<font color="yellow">I gave it some thought last night.</font>

787
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,790
<font color="yellow">Isn't it strange that things are working out so smoothly?</font>

788
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,790
<font color="yellow">Everything seems to be falling into place.</font>

789
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,320
<font color="yellow">It feels strange, doesn't it?</font>

790
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:21,450
<font color="yellow">What? Are you suspecting me?</font>

791
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,650
<font color="yellow">No. I'm not suspecting you.</font>

792
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,450
<font color="yellow">I've seen a lot of guys who approach me for my money.</font>

793
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,690
<font color="yellow">Some of them want to con me.</font>

794
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,990
<font color="yellow">Some of them hope to get some crumbs off of my table.</font>

795
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,350
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I've seen many of them.</font>

796
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,990
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I filter them out?</font>

797
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,220
<font color="yellow">I rearrange the appointment.</font>

798
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:45,120
<font color="yellow">Why? If it's real, it won't be a problem.</font>

799
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,720
<font color="yellow">If it's not, they will fail to keep their words.</font>

800
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,220
<font color="yellow">Another reason is that swindlers...</font>

801
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:55,290
<font color="yellow">prepare everything for the day of appointment.</font>

802
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,260
<font color="yellow">That jerks.</font>

803
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,120
<font color="yellow">They set up a trap and wait for me.</font>

804
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,750
<font color="yellow">They want to eat me alive.</font>

805
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,530
<font color="yellow">Maybe they do. But I'm not lying.</font>

806
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,920
<font color="yellow">That friend of yours.</font>

807
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,520
<font color="yellow">He works there every day, right? He should be there...</font>

808
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,720
<font color="yellow">whenever I visit, right?</font>

809
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,950
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Of course. What are you talking about?</font>

810
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,190
<font color="yellow">Why won't you believe me? He works there. Gosh.</font>

811
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:30,290
<font color="yellow">Let's go down there right now.</font>

812
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,330
<font color="yellow">Then I'll believe you.</font>

813
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,350
<font color="yellow">I'll believe every word you say.</font>

814
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,390
<font color="yellow">Of course we can go now.</font>

815
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,520
<font color="yellow">But I'm working now. I can't leave office.</font>

816
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,450
<font color="yellow">Come on. I know you're often on outside duty.</font>

817
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,450
<font color="yellow">You can go out.</font>

818
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,520
<font color="yellow">Let's just go now.</font>

819
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:55,050
<font color="yellow">We can take a drive and have nice dinner on our way back.</font>

820
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,750
<font color="yellow">How does it sound? Let's go, Mr Baek.</font>

821
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're being suspicious again.</font>

822
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,550
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

823
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,320
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

824
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,950
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

825
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,950
<font color="yellow">We can go if you want.</font>

826
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:12,650
<font color="yellow">But there is heavy traffic today.</font>

827
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,950
<font color="yellow">- Let's just go.
-  I have to finish up my work.</font>

828
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,920
<font color="yellow">You're the chief. It'll be okay.</font>

829
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,420
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Hello, Mr Kim. This is Sung Il.</font>

830
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:39,190
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to Hwaseong City Hall.</font>

831
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,620
<font color="yellow">I mean we are on our way.</font>

832
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,050
<font color="yellow">Do you have a minute to see us?</font>

833
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,530
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You said it's the day after tomorrow.</font>

834
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,000
<font color="yellow">Don't mess around.</font>

835
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,250
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

836
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,190
<font color="yellow">All right. We'll see you there.</font>

837
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,790
<font color="yellow">See me where? It's the day after tomorrow.</font>

838
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,520
<font color="yellow">I'm going down there with Mr Ma.</font>

839
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,490
<font color="yellow">To Hwaseong City Hall?</font>

840
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,320
<font color="yellow">Hello? Can you hear me?</font>

841
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,390
<font color="yellow">Hwaseong City Hall is where you work, right?</font>

842
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,720
<font color="yellow">I'm going there now with Mr Ma.</font>

843
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,720
<font color="yellow">- Did he change the plan?
-  That's right.</font>

844
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,350
<font color="yellow">Mr Ma wants to see you today.</font>

845
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,990
<font color="yellow">He thinks it's better to talk to you today.</font>

846
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,700
<font color="yellow">Anyway, we are on our way now.</font>

847
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,120
<font color="yellow">We'll probably get there in an hour and a half.</font>

848
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,990
<font color="yellow">I'll look forward to it.</font>

849
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,120
<font color="yellow">All right. Bye.</font>

850
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,920
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

851
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,050
<font color="yellow">Did he say he can see us?</font>

852
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,190
<font color="yellow">Of course. That's where he works.</font>

853
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,150
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

854
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,950
<font color="yellow">Can you turn on the air conditioner? It's hot.</font>

855
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,040
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
-  Hello, Sir.</font>

856
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,190
<font color="yellow">- Let's have lunch together.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

857
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,350
<font color="yellow">- Have a great day.
-  All right.</font>

858
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,050
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Is this Detective Sa Jae Sung?</font>

859
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:18,650
<font color="yellow">I'm calling to report a fraud.</font>

860
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,820
<font color="yellow">His name is Yang Jung Do.</font>

861
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,150
<font color="yellow">Do you know him?</font>

862
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,150
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

863
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,650
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

864
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

865
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,350
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

866
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,450
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang.</font>

867
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,650

868
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,790
<font color="yellow">Do as I say.</font>

869
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,050
<font color="yellow">Stop saying we don't have time!</font>

872
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,090
<font color="yellow">Ma Jin Seok may be on to us.</font>

873
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,620
<font color="yellow">If we fail...</font>

00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,290
<font color="yellow">If we don't succeed, we'll be all dead.</font>

875
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,290
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

878
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,350
<font color="yellow">Ma Jin Seok doubles that money and gives it back to him.</font>

879
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,620
<font color="yellow">If we get Bang Pil Gyu,</font>

880
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:30,250
<font color="yellow">maybe we can help Sung Il keep his job.</font>

881
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,960
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

882
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,050
<font color="yellow">Ja Wang is working on a phishing website.</font>

883
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:39,020

884

885
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,620
<font color="yellow">It's not the land we showed him.</font>

886
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,590
<font color="yellow">Jung Do. I heard you're trying to con Ma Jin Seok for six million.</font>

887
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,350
<font color="yellow">Go to him yourself with that contract.</font>

888
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:51,550
<font color="yellow">The second you sign it,</font>

889

-  Give it your best shot.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll be hard to catch.</font>
