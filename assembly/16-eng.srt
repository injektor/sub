<i>All characters, party names, and incidents appearing in this drama are fictitious creations.</i>

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,810
What do you want to ask me?

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,530
Oh, there is a matter we are internally investigating.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,550
Internal investigation?

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,340
You know Hanmin Bank?

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,870
Hanmin Bank...

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,030
You received a shopping bag with money in it from the bank president's secretary

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,950
and delivered it to Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, right?

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,820
Tell me, did you deliver it to Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil or not?

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,350
<i>6th Day of the Parliamentary Inspection</i>

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
Topic...

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:04,370
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

13
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,610
<i>Episode 16</i>

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,190
- Dong Cheon.<br>- Yes.

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,470
You didn't leak this questionnaire to the Ministry of the Environment, right?

16
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,350
Absolutely not.

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,240
Oh, wait...

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,510
I guess even a busy person like you participates in the parliamentary inspection?

19
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,760
- Because I'm an assemblyman before being a secretary general.<br>- Yeah...

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,390
How do you find your first parliamentary inspection? Doable?

21
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,770
Haven't you seen the mid-term announcement from that Parliamentary Inspection Monitor or something?

22
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,870
I made the candidate list for being the best assemblyman during the parliamentary inspection.

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,090
That deserves congratulations.

24
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,670
Shall I tell you one more thing I should be congratulated on?

25
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,210
Our party conduced a public opinion poll in Gyeongje City yesterday.

26
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,750
Secretary General, you got 35% and I, 58%.

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,930
Public opinion is like a lover just before jilting you. Don't count on it too much.

28
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,310
Didn't I tell you before

29
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,660
that I would never lose to you, if only for Hyung Dal Soo's sake?

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,510
I... will trample you.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,520
There is a fact that you must be aware of, too.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,160
That this inspection is the first and last parliamentary inspection for you.

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,120
Ah... just one look and I can tell

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,900
you are brewing some stinking sh*t. I better be careful.

35
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,490
Then.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,330
<i>2015 Parliamentary Inspection by Environment and Labor Committee</i>

37
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,510
See this, okay? See this right now.

38
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,030
These are the numbers showing marine pollution

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,340
due to the industrial wastewater in Gyeongje City.

40
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,270
Look, in BOD from 5

41
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,170
to 16.4, 4.5 to 18.95 in COD. Take a look!

42
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,850
How many times is this!

43
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,650
Are you going to kill them all?

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,810
Are you crazy?!

45
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,530
What are you doing not managing these things!

46
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,290
Are you going to kill everyone in Gyeongje City?

47
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,560
Don't touch the glasses!

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,870
I'll give this to you, so take it home and study it.

49
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,690
Take a very careful look.

50
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,450
Frame it, put it up on the wall and study it everyday.

51
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,110
Play it, Secretary Park.

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,620
A group of experts, my staff and I

53
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,150
personally went down to Gyeongje River and tested the water quality.

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,450
Our Director of Korea Water Quality Management Company, take a look.

55
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,870
Take a good look. Is that a river now?

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,390
Huh?

57
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,260
Does that look like a river? What do you see?

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,690
Does it seem like sewage water?

59
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,890
Do you think that was pumped from a septic tank?

60
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,970
That is none other than the Gyeongje River. The current Gyeongje River where all fishes have died out!

61
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,310
Huh?! What are you going to do about it?

62
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,710
What are you going to do about all those fishes? You hurry and revive them now!

63
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,250
Moving on to the next one.

64
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,010
Do you see that, huh?

65
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,370
Are you tending a green tea field in the river, now?

66
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,290
Green tea field, green tea field? What are you going to do?

67
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,190
What kind of management work are you doing, seriously!

68
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,570
Stop fidgeting with your glasses. Why do you, why...

69
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,000
I even personally brought a sample.

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Do you see this? I thought you might not believe it. I didn't put anything in it, I just ladled this out, personally.

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,650
Taste it.

72
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,860
Here, this too. You are getting plenty today.

73
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,130
Why are we not prepared?

74
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,130
Are you sticking it to me?

75
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,150
From tomorrow until the end of the parliamentary inspection, prepare all questionnaires like that. Go back to your seat.

76
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,880
Only my aides can do it. Not everyone is capable of that.

77
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,310
And do you admit this levee construction in Gyeongje City was done shoddily?

78
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,530
It wasn't shoddy work.

79
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,710
Not shoddy work? Are you sure?

80
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,770
You can get punished for perjury during a parliamentary inspection. Don't you know?

81
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,910
Seeing how you're touching your glasses, it is a lie. Fine.

82
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,770
I will read you all of the materials I prepared.

83
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,190
First... Ah, ah, ah. Chairwoman, please give me more time.

84
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,170
Enough already. Other assemblymen have to question too.

85
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,590
But I have to do everything I prepared. When I came with this much preparation...

86
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,530
If you do everything at the beginning, what does that make us?

87
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,450
Are you the only one doing the parliamentary inspection? When we've prepared as much as you?

88
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,560
Wow, between fellow party members, you're so petty.

89
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,760
Assemblyman Jin, I will give you my five minutes of additional question time. Use that.

90
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Aigo, thank you, Assemblywoman Cheon! Aigo, thank you.

91
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,240
Did you see that? When even an opposition party assemblywoman is like that?

92
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,260
But please give it to me quickly, the 5 minutes?

93
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,980
Oh, it's working well.

94
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,020
Witness, from now on, to the questions I ask

95
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,860
answer in no uncertain terms. Understand?

96
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,080
Aren't you really going to submit the materials?

97
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,740
Don't you know this is against the Board of Audit and Inspection Act?

98
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,700
What? A meal?

99
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,820
That place's taste has changed, unlike the good old times. But I know...

100
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,380
Now, did I ask for a meal or materials? It's not like I'm going around hungry.

101
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,760
Send them to me by midnight. Hang up.

102
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,980
But what do they take an aide for?

103
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,380
Rain, rain. Eat the rain man.

104
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,160
Which one do I eat? Which one?

105
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,480
Of course you have to eat ssangpi. That's right!

106
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,540
Rain ssangpi.

107
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,740
That's right.

108
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
What are you doing?

109
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm just taking a breather from making press materials.

110
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm going to go to Aide Choi and tell on you.

111
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,500
It's fun, right? Right?

112
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,620
So much fun. You can't lose the money I've won.

113
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,040
I got it, I got it.

114
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,540
Just because they don't have to work on questionnaires, they are being too much.

115
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,860
Yes, why?

116
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>Environment and Labor Committee<br>Meeting Room</i>

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Aide Seo, you did write a questionnaire to support companies with innovative environmental technologies, right?

118
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,160
Yes, but why?

119
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,320
But the Assemblyman does not have it.

120
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
What did you say?

121
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,160
When I worked so hard to make this questionnaire,

122
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,920
how can you take this out?

123
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,520
It does not fit the tone of the Assemblyman's legislative activities.

124
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,840
But that the government should give some support to companies that come up with cutting-edge new technologies...

125
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,380
Why does that not fit the Assemblyman's tone?

126
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,760
It does not fit.

127
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,780
Look here, Aide Choi. Even though you're the senior aide, this is exceeding your authority.

128
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm in charge of questionnaires.

129
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,000
I was not going to bring this up, but

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
that questionnaire. Didn't a new technology company solicit you to write it?

131
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,080
What? What do you take me for...

132
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,220
Special interest legislation after getting lobbied for it, that is not the only evil thing.

133
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,760
Making special interest questionnaires like this one after getting solicitations, that practice also has to disappear!

134
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,260
Since the Assemblyman does not know about this, be careful not to repeat this sort of thing in the future.

135
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,230
What do you mean the Assemblyman doesn't know? Do you even know who that company owner is?

136
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,120
- Who?<br>- President Lee Taek Jo of SOI.

137
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
Lee Taek Jo?

138
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,680
I mean that $5000 designer watch that almost cost Secretary Kim his job...

139
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,880
The person who gave that.

140
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
The Assemblyman returned that watch.

141
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,240
Who returned what now?

142
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,700
When the giver says he didn't get it back.

143
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,340
- What?<br>- How could I stick it out without writing him that questionnaire?

144
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,320
<i>Give it to me. I will return it to President Lee.</i>

145
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,260
<i>It's okay. The punk who received it must return it.</i>

146
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Parliamentary inspection is no small job.

147
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,740
Really...

148
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,480
Aide Choi, get me Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi's address.

149
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,760
So I can try to see her.

150
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,680
Give me an honest answer to the question I'm about to ask.

151
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,900
Why are you like this again all of a sudden? What is it?

152
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,000
What did you do with that designer watch you had received from President Lee Taek Jo?

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,780
I got cash for it and bought bread for homeless people.

154
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,460
Don't joke around!

155
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm not joking.

156
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,640
You are not joking?

157
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,100
If you don't believe me, ask Gyu Hwan.

158
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,880
He worked like a dog for several days because of that.

159
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,080
Didn't you say you exchange emails everyday?

160
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,690
Why don't you just confess?

161
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,130
From a trustworthy source,

162
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,690
we got very detailed information about your involvement in the delivery of the bribe before summoning you.

163
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,310
<i>Because I was not convinced by Chief Secretary Lim's transcript alone,</i>

164
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,110
<i>I put temptation in the Assemblyman's way.</i>

165
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:54,470
Pleading the fifth, may get you left holding the bag.

166
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,370
Fine. Why don't you just leave for today?

167
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,710
Take out money from the Assemblyman's salary

168
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,370
tomorrow and buy the exact same watch as the one President Lee gave.

169
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,150
Okay.

170
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,670
Forget it, why do that?

171
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,840
You stay quiet, Assemblyman.

172
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,340
Clearly you have violated the Political Funds Act.

173
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,320
But, just...

174
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,110
It's just, it's okay.

175
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,940
If I had that kind of money, I'd rather buy my Joo Hee some clothes.

176
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,280
Would it have been any better to do that?

177
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,860
Are you some sort of a benevolent thief who robs from the rich to give to the poor?

178
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,620
Why did you buy homeless people bread, why?

179
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,020
Then, should I have bought those people in poor health alcohol? Of course I should have bought them bread.

180
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,060
Assemblyman!

181
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,320
I am sorry. At that time, I did not know

182
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,900
that things would get this serious.

183
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,380
You just try this one more time. Then, I'm really going to cane you.

184
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,640
Me too.

185
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,970
7769? Call.

186
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,570
<i>Who is it?</i>

187
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,430
Oh, hello. I am Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, the People's Spoilsport who always tries his best.

188
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,250
Is Assemblywoman Hong home, by any chance?

189
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,830
<i>No, she is not.</i>

190
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,290
Oh, really? Then, do you by any chance know where...

191
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,100
Hello?

192
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,060
Hello!

193
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,400
What the...

194
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,720
Does this run in her family? Why hang up so suddenly?

195
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Seriously...

196
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,680
Yes, this is Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, the People's Spoilsport who always tries his best.

197
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,980
Assemblyman.

198
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,380
Oh,

199
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,070
it's you, Gyu Hwan.

200
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,210
Yes.

201
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,050
Okay,

202
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,750
have you been well?

203
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,310
Where are you right now?

204
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,290
Hey, punk, while an elder is

205
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,190
greeting you, how can you abruptly ask for the whereabouts?

206
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,270
Punk, do you really want to get some beating?

207
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,490
I said where are you!

208
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,270
I am out to meet someone, happy, punk?

209
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,550
I would like to see you now.

210
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,710
Now?

211
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,090
- Gyu Hwan, let's meet at home.<br>- Assemblyman!

212
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,540
I'll get home soon, so let's meet at home in a little bit. I've got to go.

213
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,280
Assemblywoman Hong!

214
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,970
How can an assemblywoman not come to the Assembly?

215
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,670
Because you are not even showing your face in the inspection hearings,

216
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,130
reporters and NGOs are up in arms about that, do you know that?

217
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,410
I am prepared to be reviled.

218
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,390
During my press conference to announce my resignation, I will return my salary

219
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
and apologize to the people.

220
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,070
Are you really going to resign?

221
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,830
Yes.

222
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,950
No, don't do that. Just join Indifferent-to-BH faction.

223
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,520
I will be good to you.

224
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,040
I guess you're mistaken because I opposed your expulsion.

225
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,480
But at that time, just out of embarrassment...

226
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,480
I did that because I didn't want to be embarrassed.

227
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,220
It's okay if you do not join Indifferent-to-BH faction.

228
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,220
But isn't quitting the Assembly too much?

229
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,360
When the people put you there.

230
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,580
The people

231
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,360
put me there?

232
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Of course.

233
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,400
No.

234
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,520
I was just the newest model...

235
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,400
the brand-new latest product.

236
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,420
What, newest? A new model?

237
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,720
During the general election 4 years ago,

238
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,780
displayed in a window of the shop called the Gookmin Party,

239
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,780
the latest item with a glitzy design but of unproven quality!

240
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,680
That was Hong Chan Mi.

241
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,990
Why do you torment yourself like that?

242
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,550
What's wrong with you, when you are pretty and smart?

243
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,290
You talk well. You're diligent.

244
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,110
It's just your personality that is a bit...

245
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,790
When I was selected as a proportional representative and entered the Assembly with high expectations

246
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,330
I heard the words the staff and reporters were whispering behind my back.

247
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,470
What did they say?

248
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,370
Hong Chan Mi, a pretty face put on the general election.

249
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,110
Hong Chan Mi who picked up a windfall gold badge.

250
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,150
Sooner or later, she will fall out of fashion

251
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,470
and after 4 years, Hong Chan Mi will be flung into a pile of drastically discounted sale goods.

252
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,310
Yes, so that maybe why

253
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,710
I was so hung up on getting a nomination.

254
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,690
Because I didn't want to acknowledge what was said,

255
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,940
But...

256
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,350
But, truthfully, I,

257
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,550
Hong Chan Mi, I was really

258
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,030
the worst.

259
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:57,010
You still have a lot of time. The game is not over yet.

260
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,820
Muster up courage

261
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,760
and let's walk together.

262
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,480
Okay?

263
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,520
But, Assemblywoman Hong...

264
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,480
Frankly, I...

265
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
do not dislike you, Assemblyman Jin.

266
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,300
But when I see you, I feel very uncomfortable.

267
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,010
Am I that shabby?

268
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,680
Our Aide Choi didn't speak harshly, to that extent at least.

269
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,860
I want to quickly forget how cheap I was.

270
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,040
But when I see you, I cannot.

271
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,290
What?

272
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,910
Let us never see each other again.

273
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,990
Assemblywoman Hong!

274
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,180
Kim Gyu Hwan.

275
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,700
What are you going to do when you see Assemblyman Jin?

276
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,320
Whatever I do, what business of yours is it?

277
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,820
Just now,

278
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,660
I got a statement from the Hanmin Bank employee who delivered the bribe to you.

279
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,220
That is a lie. I do not know anything about this.

280
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,120
Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan, you are under arrest.

281
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,580
<i>Secretary General, Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil is now like a cornered rat.</i>

282
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,490
Secretary General?

283
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,780
Do Hyeon, is something bothering you?

284
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,430
Eh, punk.

285
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,340
How did I end up like this?

286
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,370
What are you talking about?

287
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:26,250
No, it's just... that thought came to me.

288
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,000
I understand that your pride is hurt because of Jin Sang Pil.

289
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,140
But don't worry about that rascal. I will cut him out.

290
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,920
No need for that.

291
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,530
Because it's coming to an end now.

292
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,970
You, do you want to be jailed?

293
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,150
That will be a huge obstacle if you want to be a civil servant.

294
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:12,350
Everything is bound to come out when cross-examination is conducted and the CCTV footage is analyzed.

295
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,510
Answer me. You received it, right?

296
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,550
Yes, I received it.

297
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,370
You delivered it to Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, right?

298
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,780
Yes.

299
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,210
Yes, Prosecutor. Kim Gyu Hwan says he delivered the money to Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

300
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,590
But the Assemblyman must have returned the money. You're doing all this for nothing!

301
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,920
But the giver says he never got it back.

302
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,190
What?

303
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,620
Sang Pil, can't we just eat first?

304
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,070
But we have to eat together with Gyu Hwan when he comes.

305
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,260
The stew and all this will get cold.

306
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,740
Then we can re-heat them.

307
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,520
<i>Your call is not answered and will be connected to the voicemail box...</i>

308
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
Why isn't he answering?

309
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,480
Do you think maybe he got into a car accident on his way here?

310
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,060
Don't say such an unlucky thing. Three spits (and what you said will never come true).

311
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,990
Besides this questionnaire, is there any other favor you did for President Lee Taek Jo?

312
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,360
No.

313
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,880
Delete the questionnaire file right away.

314
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,280
Okay, I understand.

315
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,900
Who are you people?

316
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,540
What are you doing right now?

317
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,910
We are from the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

318
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,360
<i>Search and Seizure Warrant</i>

319
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,590
Please cooperate with our search and seizure.

320
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,730
You didn't even take off your shoes.

321
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,720
No...

322
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,870
<i>It's okay if you do not join Indifferent-to-BH faction.</i>

323
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,680
<i>But isn't quitting the Assembly too much?</i>

324
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,060
<i>When the people put you there.</i>

325
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,460
<i>Last evening, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office carried out a search and seizure</i>

326
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,750
<i>of Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's residence and Assembly office.</i>

327
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,720
- Bribe?<br><i>- During the past Babel Tower City bankruptcy scandal, Assemblyman Jin</i>

328
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>met Hanmin Bank President Kim Doo Shik who had sold his wife, a Mrs. Kim, a share of the related fund,</i>

329
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,540
<i>and by threatening him with service of a subpoena</i>

330
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,740
<i>to a parliamentary investigation, allegedly extorted $20,000 of illegal money from him.</i>

331
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,170
Yes, it is true that I... met with Bank President Kim.

332
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,890
And

333
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:22,420
it is also true that I told him I would subpoena him to a parliamentary investigation.

334
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:32,210
However, it is nonsense that I acted with the intent to extort money.

335
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,720
<i>The prosecution immediately arrested Assemblyman Jin's former secretary, a Mr. Kim, and questioned him on related facts.</i>

336
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,970
<i>That Mr. Kim allegedly stated that he had delivered the money</i>

337
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,860
<i>he got from Bank President Kim's side to Assemblyman Jin in the bank's underground garage.</i>

338
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,880
It is true that the money was delivered to me.

339
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,500
But that very day, I met Bank President Kim and returned it right away.

340
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:02,000
Directly. Frankly, because my wife and daughter were on my mind

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,090
it is true that I wavered a bit.

342
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,850
If you want to punish me for that, I will gladly pay for it.

343
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,110
<i>From Bank President Kim's Associate:<br>It's true that the Assemblyman returned in a few hours</i>

344
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,480
<i>but Bank President said he demanded more money because it was less than the amount his wife lost.</i>

345
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,200
<i>When he refused, he left in a huff</i>

346
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,740
<i>and when he called for a special prosecution out of the blue, the president was shocked.</i>

347
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,340
<i>The prosecution plans to summon and question Assemblyman Jin after completing analysis of the seized evidence.</i>

348
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,130
<i>This is KBC News...</i>

349
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,970
Wow, what a ridiculous bastard...

350
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,790
After having done that, in that press conference

351
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,710
"Honey... I'm sorry.

352
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,580
I... am not a person who can only look after my family, right?"

353
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,100
Didn't he say that?

354
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:54,180
The case feels somehow... a bit... strange.

355
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,810
Ehhh, really.

356
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:01,610
The prosecution opened up the case to the public too because they feel sure about it.

357
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,130
The only thing remaining for Jin Sang Pil now is to stand

358
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,060
in the mugshot line and get his ID photo taken.

359
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,620
You just watch. No doubt about it.

360
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,120
Secretary General, congratulations.

361
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,770
You can leave now.

362
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,320
Assemblyman Jin, are you going to respond to the prosecution's call?

363
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,810
This is the parliamentary inspection season. I don't have time to go there.

364
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,470
Are you saying you will be unresponsive? Please tell us!

365
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,290
Tell us.

366
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,760
Assemblyman.

367
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,800
I... cannot cooperate with the prosecutors who only believe

368
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,620
Bank President Kim's lies and paint me as a shameless criminal.

369
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,030
If they want to see my face, they will have to drag me there by force.

370
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,830
Just one more word.

371
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,320
Let us go in now. Enough already.

372
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,820
- I am sorry.<br>- Assemblyman!

373
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,470
We will distribute additional press materials soon.

374
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,940
- By when...<br>- We are sorry, sorry.

375
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,590
Assemblyman!

376
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:13,500
Ahew, but if a wife does not tell her husband, who does she talk to?

377
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,610
Isn't that so?

378
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,240
Don't worry and just take good care of Joo Hee.

379
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,640
You... are really okay, right?

380
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,540
Yes, that is what I said. Our Aide Choi said, with regard to assemblymen,

381
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,600
unless they are caught in the middle of committing a crime, the prosecution can do nothing.

382
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,620
Right, that is the kind of person I am right now.

383
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,630
So there is nothing to worry about. Right.

384
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,960
Okay, okay, bye.

385
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,830
This matter...

386
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,400
Secretary General Baek is behind this, no doubt.

387
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,520
Gyu Hwan... What is happening to him?

388
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,700
It seems he's still in the prosecutors' office.

389
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,020
Don't worry.

390
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:34,500
Since they have to release him within 48 hours of arrest, he will be out in no time.

391
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,340
Since I have given all my statements, I can leave now, right?

392
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,750
Let me just confirm one more thing.

393
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,430
- What is this?<br>- We found this while recovering data from your laptop computer.

394
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,610
Tell me what that is.

395
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,450
Okay then.

396
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,820
Did somebody die?

397
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,990
Why are you all so crestfallen?

398
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,950
You can't possibly be thinking that I pocketed that money, can you?
subtitles ripped andsynced by riri13

399
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,780
There is no one here who thinks that..

400
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,750
Da Jeong, why are you crying?

401
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,530
It's just that... I'm so mad at these absurd things taking place.

402
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,750
I am sorry.

403
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,250
Don't cry. Why cry?

404
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,970
Your assemblyman won't even bat an eye at this.

405
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,130
Secretary Song, how are the netizens' responses?

406
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,290
Half on the Assemblyman's side, half on the prosecution's side.

407
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,060
Good, that is plenty.

408
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,110
- Aide Seo.<br>- Yes.

409
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:17,030
Please work with Secretary Sim and Da Jeong to wrap up the parliamentary inspection that is soon coming to an end.

410
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,510
I got it.

411
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:25,230
Everyone else will work with me to wage a nationwide campaign asserting the Assemblyman's innocence.

412
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,430
But will it work with just us?

413
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,150
Just now, Jin Ji Mo leaders all over the nation called saying they would help out

414
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,270
together with the fan club members.

415
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,110
- Really?<br>- Uh huh.

416
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,780
See? Even if the sky caves in on you, there will be a way out of it for us.

417
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,750
There are people who believe in JSP till the end!

418
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,270
So let us cheer up and fight for it. Aja!

419
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,590
Aja.

420
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,870
Eh, why are you guys like this, really? Louder! Aja aja!

421
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,970
- Aja, aja, aja!<br>- Scorchhh...

422
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,050
What is scorchhh?

423
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:07,650
Assemblyman, the designer watch President Lee Taek Jo gave you ..;

424
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,910
just came up in an article.

425
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,470
Huh?

426
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,160
<i>Jin Sang Pil Received a Designer Watch from a Businessman, Too!</i>

427
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,790
<i>Revealed that he liquidated it and used the cash...<br>Prosecution will prove it was a kickback.</i>

428
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,490
How did they find out about this?

429
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,560
- It's Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil!<br>- I heard that bastard is a total thief?

430
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,190
I had thought we finally got ourselves a pretty decent assemblyman, but...

431
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,270
- This is why the have-nots should not get involved in politics.<br>- Aish!

432
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,310
Hyung, just come.

433
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,090
Hurry and come.

434
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,410
We urge that Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil be detained and investigated!

435
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,510
Even though Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil is claiming

436
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,630
that he bought bread for homeless people with the designer watch he received,

437
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,270
he's lying through his teeth!

438
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,050
In a seized parliamentary inspection questionnaire, the prosecution

439
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,490
found a proposal to provide financial support to the company

440
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,090
run by the person who gave the designer watch!

441
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,350
A person like Jin Sang Pil...

442
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,770
Let's go quickly.

443
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,030
...should no longer waste the people's blood-like taxes!

444
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:22,470
Everyone! Please sign the petition for his arrest and interrogation!

445
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,750
<i>A motion to approve Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's arrest is before the Assembly that just concluded inspections of the affairs of state.</i>

446
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,510
<i>Today, the government submitted to the Assembly a motion to allow Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's arrest so he can be</i>

447
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,970
<i>interrogated in custody over bribery charges.</i>

448
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,390
<i>The Assembly plans to open a plenary session soon to address the arrest motion.</i>

449
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,350
<i>Under current law, the Assembly in receipt of an arrest motion must propose an opening of a plenary session</i>

450
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,550
<i>and vote on the motion in that plenary session 24 hours after and within 72 hours from the report of the motion.</i>

451
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,770
<i>An arrest motion can be passed only if a majority of the assemblymen are present</i>

452
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,830
<i>and if a majority of that quorum agree.</i>

453
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,890
<i>It is not clear yet whether this motion will be passed.</i>

454
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,790
<i>In fact, there have been many incidents where an arrest motion failed to pass the Assembly.</i>

455
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,170
You will only get more depressed if you keep watching this kind of news.

456
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,630
Go home early today.

457
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,230
People do not believe what I say.

458
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,430
It's not that they don't believe you,

459
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:28,950
but as much as they liked you, they've received a huge shock.

460
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,610
With time, they will change.

461
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:42,250
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

462
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,530
What will happen if the legislature passes his arrest motion?

463
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,170
Eight or nine out of ten, he will be taken into custody.

464
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,570
Custody?

465
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,970
If things go wrong, he may not even be able to leave jail until the end of his term.

466
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:16,830
No matter what, we have to block the arrest motion from being passed.

467
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,550
What do you think about writing to all Assembly members, pleading with them not to vote for his arrest?

468
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,290
No. If the Assemblyman makes such a move,

469
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,650
he may get criticized for using parliamentary immunity against being arrested during the session as a shield.

470
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,810
He was framed anyway, so what's wrong with using it as a shield?

471
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,340
Insist on the injustice of passing the arrest motion...

472
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,490
I know it is a huge favor to ask.

473
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:51,550
However, the only person who would help our Assemblyman right now is you, Assemblywoman Cheon.

474
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,230
I am sorry, but that will be difficult.

475
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,950
Assemblywoman...

476
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,690
As you know, my party's position is that we should curtail

477
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,570
or repeal parliamentary immunity.

478
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:12,270
Even though I feel sorry for Assemblyman Jin, I am afraid I can't.

479
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,070
I am here to ask your learned opinion about the motion to allow Jin Sang Pil's arrest.

480
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:37,080
The prosecution is too insolent.

481
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,450
They should not scoff at the legislature like this.

482
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,830
Consider the citizens' sentiment nowadays.

483
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,950
If it fails to pass, the whole of the legislature will be reviled.

484
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,370
Okay, I will send a message to Assemblyman Kang.

485
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,830
- Thank you.<br>- But...

486
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:04,690
- isn't this the sort of matter handled by the floor leader?<br>- Excuse me?

487
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,110
Secretary General Baek... Lately,

488
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,870
you seem to violate too often the lane change and speed regulations.

489
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,110
In the past, while observing the traffic rules,

490
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,530
you drove very cleanly too.

491
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,910
I guess lately I feel a bit pressed.

492
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,430
I will be more careful.

493
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:40,280
At any event, I guess this is the end of Jin Sang Pil too.

494
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,680
Dad!

495
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,310
Startled me... Hey, how did you get here?

496
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,670
Is it true that you will get nabbed?

497
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,670
Who told you? Who said that I would get nabbed?

498
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,970
Then, what is that that allowing arrest thing?

499
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,150
Where did you pick that up?

500
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,990
Hey, if you are a ninth grader, then you should ask a ninth-grader question.

501
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,650
Tell me quickly! What is that?

502
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,950
Your daddy is an assemblyman.

503
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,390
A person who does a very important job.

504
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:26,570
But when Daddy is working hard on an important job, the police ahjussi's cannot catch Dad, willy nilly.

505
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,070
They have to get all the other assemblymen's agreement.

506
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,270
Then, other assemblymen must oppose it for you.

507
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,610
That's right.

508
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:40,490
But, your Daddy is the most popular one among the assemblymen.

509
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:45,970
So in terms of celebs, I am on the same level as Ahjussi Song Hae.

510
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,690
So everyone is on your Daddy's side.

511
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,670
You're telling me the truth, right?

512
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,250
Truthfully. Daddy will never get nabbed.

513
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,170
Yes.

514
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,910
<i>Aide-nim.</i>

515
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,290
Kim Gyu Hwan?

516
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,830
You've had a really hard time, haven't you?

517
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,910
I am sorry.

518
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,030
Isn't there a way for me to help the Assemblyman?

519
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,790
For now, laying low is helping him.

520
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,670
Staying near the Assemblyman may

521
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,810
only raise the prosecution's suspicion needlessly.

522
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,930
It's all my fault.

523
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,420
Don't blame yourself too much.

524
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,450
Even though you may have been responsible for the luxury watch,

525
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,150
being momentarily tempted by the money

526
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,600
received from the Hanmin Bank president was the Assemblyman's fault.

527
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,570
At the time...

528
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,980
I forced the Assemblyman to accept the money against his will

529
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,910
when he told me to return it immediately.

530
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,020
What?

531
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,540
So if the Assemblyman actually accepted it,

532
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,960
I was intending to give a tip to

533
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,580
Chief Secretary Im Gyu Tae.

534
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,160
What do you mean Im Gyu Tae?

535
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,700
Secretary General Baek's Chief Secretary?

536
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,200
Yes.

537
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,960
What are you saying?

538
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,970
What brings you here?

539
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,550
Is it true that

540
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,300
you incited Secretary Kim Gyu Hwan to feed you information about Assemblyman Jin's corruption?

541
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,700
If it's true, is that a problem?

542
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,820
Leave.

543
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,790
You piece of trash!

544
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,490
What?

545
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,510
What is happening?

546
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,950
Secretary General Baek.

547
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,870
So you've met Gyu Hwan, together with Secretary Lim?

548
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,790
I only met him because he said he had information to give.

549
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,270
The fact is he changed his mind and just left.

550
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,340
Like hell!

551
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,350
The real fact is

552
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,700
you have become a scumbag politician

553
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,330
who goes around digging up other people's dirt.

554
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,870
Yes.

555
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,060
That's what has happened to me now.

556
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
And I

557
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,510
am willing to sink a lot lower than this toward the bottom

558
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,530
if it is expedient.

559
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,640
Understand?

560
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,120
Get ready to provide food and supplies to your Assemblyman when he is behind bars.

561
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:03,060
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

562
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,360
What do you mean it's difficult?

563
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,800
Why are you saying it's difficult to consent to the arrest motion?

564
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,060
We're not the government's minions.

565
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,970
We don't have to process it without hesitation

566
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,960
just because they send us a motion.

567
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,820
But we're talking about Jin Sang Pil here.

568
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,470
Yes. Even though Jin Sang Pil has been behaving inappropriately all this time,

569
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,770
he is a fellow assemblyman, eating at the same table.

570
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:46,390
Strangling him with our own hands... that's a bit... you know.

571
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,250
Just be honest. Something's bothering you, right?

572
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,610
It's not me. It's Assemblymen Choi and Nam.

573
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,500
It seems President Lee Taek Jo fed them with something.

574
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,440
Stupid fools...

575
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,200
They say Lee Taek Jo's wife imports watches.

576
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,700
Wow... if it seems for their own benefit,

577
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,860
no questions asked, they just drop off these watches to those assemblymen.

578
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,860
I'm guessing it might be dozens who got them.

579
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,730
Did you get one too?

580
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,900
Jeez. What the heck do you see me as? Gracious!

581
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,390
I...!

582
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:37,940
I returned it the day before yesterday.

583
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:46,660
With the vote coming up, it's developed into a headache.

584
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,190
Why suffer a headache over it?

585
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,950
Just let the assemblymen who approve it vote to approve it, and the ones who oppose it vote to oppose it.

586
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,720
Just let them vote however they want.

587
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,040
The Anti-BH faction decided to vote autonomously and not in a bloc today?

588
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,020
Yes. I positively heard Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho's aide say that.

589
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,550
But why this... don't you feel it's a bit odd?

590
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,800
Sorry, I'm late.

591
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,040
Assemblyman.

592
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,780
Yes?

593
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,140
Why?

594
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,890
Whom am I secretly meeting?

595
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,460
Oh Sae Chang. The Korean Democratic Party Chair.

596
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,040
Am I going to join that party now?

597
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,910
Then I won't be Jin Sang Pil but will become Jin Sang Bird.

598
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:52,090
When it comes to birds, let us raise just one bird, Jo Woong Bird.

599
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:55,010
Oh Sae Chang is a reasonable person.

600
00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:00,240
If you explain all the circumstances leading up to this and ask for his cooperation,

601
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,610
there is a possibility that the Korean Democratic Party also will decide to vote autonomously like the Anti-BH faction.

602
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,460
Autonomously?

603
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:10,530
If that happens, there's a good chance the motion will be voted down.

604
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,570
Voted down?

605
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,690
You're saying it can be defeated.

606
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,450
Yes. I'm going to contact him right now.

607
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:23,420
I have a friend among Party Chair Oh Sae Chang's aides.

608
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,200
Wait a moment, Aide Choi.

609
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,050
Yes?

610
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,140
I will just do it.

611
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,790
I will appear before the prosecutor.

612
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,380
Assemblyman, are you in your right mind?

613
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,850
My mind is clear, of course.

614
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,890
After agonizing over it all night, that's the decision which emerged.

615
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,760
You understand that way.

616
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,530
I will go see Joo Hee and Joo Hee's mom and come back.

617
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,640
Meanwhile, get ready for my appearance at the prosecutor's office.

618
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,490
Why on earth are you doing this? I'm saying that the motion to allow you to be arrested can be defeated.

619
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,680
Defeating it does not mean I won't ever be arrested..

620
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,320
It's only until the end of the legislative session that I have immunity.

621
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,740
Until then, somehow, conditions favorable to you can be created.

622
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,940
Don't you know the regular session will end when the first snow falls?

623
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,600
Until the first snowfall, you want me to hear people saying "son-of-bi*ch"?

624
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,260
What?

625
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,950
-I can't do that, seriously. So--<br>-Assemblyman.

626
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:24,210
This time, please let's do what I decide. Without "but"...

627
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,140
No!

628
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:34,550
Are you out of your mind? Don't you know what'll happen if you appear at the prosecutor's office now?

629
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:39,910
The prosecutor already applied to a judge for an arrest warrant.

630
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,470
The court still has to review it and sign off on it.

631
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:47,280
But, as of now, chances of your arrest warrant getting denied

632
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,080
are extremely slim.

633
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,820
See? You are to eat bean rice, bean rice (euphemism for going to jail)!

634
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,350
If that happens, then it can't be helped.

635
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,620
What, you punk?

636
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,440
Secretary-nim.

637
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,990
Why are you like this, Hyung?

638
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,770
Then it can't be helped?

639
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,930
How can you say such a thing to Ae Ri and me?

640
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,040
Are you saying we should just watch

641
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,280
you wearing prison uniform and chowing down bean rice, punk?!

642
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,190
Assemblyman,for Kyung Ah and Joo Hee's sakes, too, you shouldn't be doing this.

643
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,090
I have already made up my mind.

644
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:31,360
Just because you're doing this, which citizen

645
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,670
would understand how you feel?

646
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,820
Only you will just end up being a fool.

647
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,810
All the difficulties you've gone through so far...

648
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,190
They were all for nothing and it will be the end for you!

649
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,070
Why is that the end? It is not the end.

650
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:49,910
What did you say?

651
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:55,260
The real end for me is that I hide behind

652
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,600
that parliamentary immunity or whatever. So the people

653
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,260
believing that this People's Spoilsport Jing Sang Pil is a real son-of-a-bi*ch.

654
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,890
So they will believe that the Indifferent-to-BH thing

655
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,420
we did was all just putting on a show.

656
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,810
That would be the real end.

657
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:21,400
Let's just say that I somehow got arrested. That I am all locked up.

658
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,880
Then, Aide Choi, and you, Hyung, and Secretary Oh, and our secretaries...

659
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,970
will you just play around? Of course not.

660
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,280
You will work even harder. To get me out.

661
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,970
To prove my innocence.

662
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:45,810
So how can that be the end? When I have you people.

663
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,720
Hey...

664
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,690
Aide Choi.

665
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:58,770
Yes?

666
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,510
You said you didn't want to make me

667
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,540
into an assemblyman who shines just for a moment and then disappears.

668
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,540
Yes.

669
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,880
Then let me go.

670
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,920
I'm sorry.

671
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,300
Assemblywoman, what brings you into the office today?

672
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,790
I wanted to do something before I resigned.

673
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,110
What's that?

674
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,990
The motion to arrest Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

675
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:38,950
Pro-BH and Anti-BH must be playing pat-a-cake together.

676
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,330
At least I should vote against it, as a neighbor.

677
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,330
How can you change your position just before the vote?

678
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,010
You scared me.

679
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,770
Who's changing his position?

680
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,290
The arrest motion. I heard you were going to vote yes.

681
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,380
So what do you mean, an autonomous vote?

682
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,360
I never said such a thing.

683
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,160
And the autonomous vote,

684
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,420
isn't that a good thing?

685
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,800
Let's not tire ourselves out like this. Please unify Anti-BH faction's votes.

686
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,720
Assemblyman Jo.

687
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,300
Democracy itself is exhausting.

688
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,740
Are you not going to do democracy just because it's exhausting?!

689
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,260
Ha!

690
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,740
Where...

691
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,630
Yes.

692
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,550
Voluntarily go to the prosecutor?

693
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,710
Voluntarily go to the prosecutor?

694
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,230
Who? Jin Sang Pil?

695
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,030
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil decides to voluntarily go to the prosecutor.</i>

696
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:48,090
<i> Jin's side insists on his innocence and emphasizes that he will be openly interrogated by the prosecutor regardless of the Assembly's decision on his arrest motion...</i>

697
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:51,050
Voluntarily go to the prosecutor.

698
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,020
What is this?

699
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,400
Please take good care of them.

700
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,120
I have great faith in you. Please help Aide Choi out a lot.

701
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,440
Assemblyman, please don't worry about this office.

702
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,060
Yes.

703
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,740
Secretary Sim, spend less time drinking, singing, and dancing.

704
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,010
Yes, I will.

705
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,610
You've lost a lot of weight.

706
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:27,050
For Miss Song, I have a special gift.

707
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,630
What is this?

708
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,770
Gyu Hwan's phone number.

709
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,550
Assemblyman, don't go.

710
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,050
Do well.

711
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,270
Da Jeong, do well too.

712
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:51,510
Don't be too disappointed with the National Assembly. Understand?

713
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,490
Yes.

714
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,780
Secretary Oh, what's with you?

715
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,820
Huh?

716
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,420
That’s what I’m saying.

717
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,700
Why am I like this?

718
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,360
Why is everyone's mood like this, really?

719
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,560
Is Assemblyman Jin going somewhere to die?

720
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,700
Assemblyman Jin is obnoxious, so even the jail won't accept him.

721
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,660
So he'll come back in one piece.

722
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,940
Isn't that so?

723
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,020
I don't think so.

724
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,110
Assemblywoman Hong.

725
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,870
From the looks of everyone's moods, you're really voluntarily going to the prosecutor.

726
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,050
Yes, well, there's that.

727
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:42,550
Now that you're entering a lion's den, who's your guard?

728
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:46,730
Is it So-and-So Choi who's the star of the tabloid rumor?

729
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:51,010
We're a combo, you know.

730
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:56,090
What can an aide do with the prosecutor outside the Assembly?

731
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,210
I'll introduce a good lawyer to you.

732
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,970
Lawyer?

733
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,970
Who?

734
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,550
Me, Hong Chan Mi.

735
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,510
What?

736
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,200
Why are you suddenly becoming my lawyer?

737
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,480
I can't give you any money. I don't have any.

738
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,740
Gosh.

739
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:36,180
I got so frustrated watching you two fools that I couldn't help it.

740
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,520
Fools?

741
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,640
The two of us?

742
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,360
Assemblyman Jin.

743
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,240
Now I am a discontinued item with only a few months left of her term.

744
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:54,100
But if it's okay with you, Assemblyman, I will work with you for my remaining months.

745
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,160
With me?

746
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,040
I will join the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

747
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,480
Assemblywoman Hong.

748
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,640
Please take care of me.

749
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,800
Assemblywoman Hong.

750
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,360
But!

751
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,100
Choi In Kyung is barred within my 2-meter radius.

752
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,600
Also prohibited from eating together or seeing me alone.

753
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,970
No...

754
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,590
Aide Choi, what do I do now? This is trouble.

755
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,630
I'll make one for you.

756
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,310
I'll make you a really great wrap.

757
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,850
Kimchi, kimchi.

758
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,590
Garlic too.

759
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,590
And... I should put the soybean paste.

760
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,070
Of course.

761
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,390
- Looks delicious.<br>- I don't do this for Mom.

762
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,790
Jealous, aren't you?

763
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,710
<i>Cheers!</i>

764
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,980
<i>Ah.</i>

765
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,880
<i>Ah, seriously.</i>

766
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,110
<i>Delicious!</i>

767
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,650
Delicious.

768
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,410
You get a glass.

769
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,090
Yeah?

770
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:21,190
You, too. Joo Hee. Have a drink.

771
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,010
It's really been a long time.

772
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,370
Cheers. Say something.

773
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,020
Our family will stay together forever!

774
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,030
Okay. Forever!

775
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,920
This is good. Why aren't you eating? Have a sip.

776
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,400
<i>We trust Assemblyman Jin!</i>

777
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,900
<i>Cheer up, Assemblyman!</i>

778
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,010
He's coming!

779
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,700
He's here!

780
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,020
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

781
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,320
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

782

<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

789
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,420
From this point on, don't answer the reporters' questions.

790
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,350
Just a word about how you feel.

791
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,710
- Okay.<br>- <i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

792
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,030

00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:36,710
- Okay.<br>- <i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

800
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,820
What made you decide to come voluntarily?

801
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,940
Tell us how you feel about getting investigated.

802
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,860
Are you still denying all charges?

803
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,020
Yes. I'm innocent.

804
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,160
What made you make a voluntary appearance?

805
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,760
What do you mean, by innocence?

806
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,020
Are you prepared to be detained?

807
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,040
- Tell us. <br>- Say something.

808
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,050
Assemblyman Jin, please tell us what made you make an appearance.

809
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,110
Assemblyman!

810
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,710
- Please give us another word.<br>- Assemblyman!

811
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,450
Please tell us why you're voluntarily going to the prosecutor.

812
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,410
Please give us another word.

813
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,990
Assemblyman!

814
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,420
<i>You're the best.</i>
