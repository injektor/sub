Assemblyman.

6
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,250
You suffered a lot.

7
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,660
I congratulate you on your release.

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,580
Thank you.

9
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,700
All of you really, really suffered a lot.

10

Congratulations.

12
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,450
Thank you. Now, let's go get them.

13
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,810
What?

14
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,120
Secretary General Baek.

15
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,620
Let's go.

16
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,000
Delete what's in here.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,110
Hurry.

18
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,550
Hey, won't you get rid of it quickly?

19
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,850
- Hey, USB!<br>- Okay.

20
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,820
Up there. That's right. Hurry up and put the hard disk.

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,440
-Quickly get it wiped clean. Hurry.<br>-Yes, I understand.

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,830
Hurry! Hurry!

23
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,910
Hello?

24
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,200
What did you say?

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,290
Secretary General, they say that the investigators have arrived.

26
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,480
Please block it. If I get arrested, I'll go to jail immediately.

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,160
You made the situation like this and...

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,550
what is it that you want me to do?

29
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,580
Secretary General.

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,910
I have no way to do that immediately.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,250
- Secretary General.<br><i>- Secretary General, we'll be entering.</i>

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,740
Since you can think on your feet, you'll know how to handle it.

33
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,070
Secretary General...

34
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,540
What are you guys doing right now?

35
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,910
I'm sorry, Secretary General. We are from the Prosecutors' Office and we ask for your cooperation.

36
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,080
-Im Gyu Tae.<br>-Yes?

37
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,740
Your arrest warrant. We are arresting you on charges of defamation and destruction of evidence.

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
Let's go.

39
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,290
Secretary General.

40
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,200
Why do you want to go in there? I told you that the police will take care of it.

41
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Since Secretary General Baek sent me to prison, I ought to thank him.

42
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,200
What is this? Where did everybody go? They are not even outside.

43
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,150
What did I tell you. There is no way they'll be here.

44
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,450
They ran because they got scared.

45
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,620
-What is the motive for your crime?<br>-Were you ordered by Secretary General Baek?

46
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,200
Secretary Im, did all this happen because of Secretary General Baek's order?

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,230
The Secretary General has nothing to do with this matter.

48
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,530
With a sincere thought that a demagogue like Assemblyman Jin must be eliminated,

49
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,250
I did everything on my own.

50
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,370
All of you move. Move.

51
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,650
Is it really true that you did everything on your own?

52
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,600
<i>The Secretary General has nothing to do with this matter.</i>

53
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,120
<i>With a sincere thought that a demagogue like Assemblyman Jin must be eliminated,</i>

54
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,280
<i>I did everything on my own.<br> (</i> Baek Do Hyeon's Chief Secretary insists he committed crime alone)

55
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,460
Yeah, right. Sincere thought, my ass.

56
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,620
<i>Looks like they'll be looking into who is behind the matter.</i>

57
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,720
<i>This is KBC news.</i>

58
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,960
Assemblyman Park, he is doing that hoping that the Secretary General will save him.

59
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,050
It's because the only person he can trust is Secretary General Baek.

60
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,600
But... if the feather won't budge like that,

61
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,330
what's going to happen to the main part of the body?

62
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,100
Since the feathers have been plucked, there'd be countless people who would cook it up and eat it.

63
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
What?

64
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,120
We can just wait with a spoon ready.

65
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,990
Reporters, take a look at the haetae statue.

66
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,910
Haetae is an imaginary creature who's supposed to crush evil and create good.

67
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,700
What would be the reason they have this statue in front of the Assembly?

68
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,310
Political schemes such as the one that happened recently must be eradicated.

69
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,450
Are you saying you also think there's someone behind this incident?

70
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,500
Every citizen knows already,

71
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,720
who the mastermind is.

72
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,160
If the investigating authority feigns ignorance,

73
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,000
they'll have to face huge resistance from the citizens.

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,430
I demand an investigation against Gookmin Party's Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon.

75
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,500
Im Gyu Tae is just a mere minion.

76
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,520
At least this time we mustn't make the mistake in which

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,160
we just pluck a feather and let the body survive.

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,960
The investigating authorities must summon Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon immediately...

79
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,790
and reveal the truth behind the scheme with absolute clarity.

80
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,660
How can something like this happen?

81
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,010
I have nothing to do with it.

82
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,280
You can't just say you have nothing to do with it. You have to take responsibility!

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,060
What do you mean, responsibility?

84
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,940
Our party is about to take a hit because of you.

85
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,040
Assemblywoman Park.

86
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,160
We have no more to say.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,050
Make a statement regarding this incident ASAP,

88
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,370
and decide what you're going to do.

89
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,200
What do you mean, decide? What are you talking about?!

90
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,450
How dare you? Do not interrupt when the party leader's speaking!

91
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,670
Let me be clear. I can't leave you with the task of choosing nominations in this circumstance.

92
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,980
Party Leader.

93
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,040
Please leave.

94
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,660
Yoon Jeong Soo, that person is leader of the party in name only but now, he acts like a real leader.

95
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,200
I made a puppet into the party leader and...

96
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,540
He thinks you have no more strings to pull.

97
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,790
So meet up with VIP and get Chief Secretary out of jail ASAP.

98
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,120
You have to save yourself too.

99
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,050
<i>Because you are an astute politician, you'd better get your act together somehow.</i>

100
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,670
<i> I trust you know what to do.</i>

101
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,690
What's the matter?

102
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,180
Do Hyeon.

103
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,250
Here comes the stew.

104
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,250
Wow, it looks good!

105
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,590
Let me know if you need more. I can make it fast.

106
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,750
How come there's just tofu? How many tofu dishes are there?

107
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,750
They taste good. You're being fussy for nothing.

108
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,010
- You eat 'em all, then.<br>- Yeah.

109
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,670
Aigoo, really.

110
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,180
Now that we're all gathered together, shall we make a toast?

111
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,020
Indifferent-to-BH, fighting!

112
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,830
Fighting!

113
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,310
But Assemblywoman Hong, are you really going to keep sitting there?

114
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,310
Did you forget the conditions for me joining Indifferent-to-BH faction?

115
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,700
Eating at the same table with Choi 00 is prohibited.

116
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,050
Just come over here. Conditions, my butt. What are you doing?

117
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,840
- Sit here.<br>- What are you doing?

118
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,910
It's weird, you sitting here alone.

119
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,320
- Assemblyman Jin.<br>- Just come. Come!

120
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Sit next to Aide Choi. Hurry!

121
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,500
Seriously.

122
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,680
From what I heard,

123
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,690
you were a perfect couple.

124
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't even bring it up. Remember the old movie we watched?

125
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,950
Starsky and Hutch. They were even better.

126
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,180
Nah. They were men.

127
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,820
Thelma and Louise.

128
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,660
Are we Chinese restaurant ad stickers? Stop sticking it everywhere.

129
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,400
I don't want to be considered at the same level as her.

130
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,260
Ah, bad temper.

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,260
I'm giving you my heart.

134

See. She says it's her heart.

135
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,200
Miss So Min, have you tried to get in touch with Gyu Hwan?

136
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,620
Pardon? That's...

137
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,320
You know his number?

138
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,520
Yeah.

139
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,740
<i> I want to call him.</i>

140
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,840
She called him several times, but he doesn't answer, she says.

141
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,180
Look here, everyone.

142
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,660
We can't not sing on a great day like this, right?

143
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,580
That's enough. Whose clamorous noise do we have to hear again?

144
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,740
Stop acting like a fool and sit down already.

145
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,880
I changed my repertory. You're too much.

146
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560

I have to see VIP and tell him I have nothing to do with this incident.

174
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,930
Secretary General Baek, let's not become any more disgraced.

175
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,750
What did you say?

176
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:13,330
If you really are VIP's close aide, act like one,

177
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,270
don't be a burden and deal with it yourself.

178
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,150
<i>Because you are an astute politician, you'd better get your act together somehow. I trust you know what to do.</i>

179
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,180
-Have you heard the Supreme Council will be held?<br>-Yes.

180
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,690
They're trying to push through Secretary General Baek's dismissal.

181
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:01,190
Seeing the timid Party Leader Yoon Jeong Soo's attempt at a quick procedure and conclusion, there must be mediation between BH and him.

182
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,290
Secretary General Baek is now in the Nakdong River...

183
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,070
A duck egg.<br> (<i> A saying which means someone has been totally isolated.</i>)

184
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,790
What is this? Why are you suddenly well paired again?

185
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,710
What are you doing by standing over there? Sit here.

186
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,750
Are you serious?

187
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,140
You are getting muscles on your ugly legs. Sit quickly.

188
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,970
Thank you.

189
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:33,560
By the way, Secretary General Baek seems to be doing some tricks like political engineering.

190
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,690
He won't docilely resign.

191
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,350
Before, when you were about to become Secretary General, he demanded secession of the President from the party.

192
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,310
There is one thing that bothers me about him.

193
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,850
What is it?

194
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,310
As one of those closest to VIP and having the most actual influence in the ruling party,

195
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,320
the intelligence that Secretary General Baek has!

196
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,330
The intelligence?

197
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,840
The statement that urges Baek Do Hyeon's resignation?

198
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,970
You have to funnel the wind before the Supreme Council meeting is held.

199
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,850
That's how that worthless person, Yoon Jeong Soo, will get his strength.

200
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,950
I got it.

201
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,420
The eel-like punk!

202
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,070
Let me see...

203
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,510
Yes.

204
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,330
What's the occasion for this visit to my office, <br>Secretary General?

205
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,790
I came to deliver something to Assemblyman Kang.

206
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,910
To me? What is it?

207
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Oh... What...

208
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,650
What is it?

209
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,250
<i>Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho.</i>

210
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,350
My name is listed here?

211
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,630
Do you remember President Lee Taek Jo who gave a luxury watch

212
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,970
to Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil and raised a scandal?

213
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,150
Lee... Lee Taek Jo?

214
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,210
This is a list of the Anti-BH assemblymen who received those luxury watches.

215
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,530
Oh, yes.

216
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,990
Deliver this to Assemblyman Park.

217
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,050
Until the Supreme Council meeting ends, do not take any action but stay still.

218
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,470
<i>Gookmin Party</i>

219
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,010
So, did you decide?

220
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,230
-Yes.<br>-You thought well.

221
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,060
Then, before the Supreme Council meeting opens, have the press conference to announce your resignation.

222
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,910
My decision is not to do that.

223
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,430
Party Leader, I am aware that you have a rather intimate relationship with Chairman Kim of Yoongwang Company.

224
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,350
What is the meaning of your saying that?

225
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:18,850
Earlier, I know that you and Chairman Kim went together to Central America for economic issues.

226
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,190
At that time, the amount of travel expenses you received was...

227
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,190
Secretary General Baek.

228
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,600
This is but one of the many pieces of information that I have.

229
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,330
If you are interested in other information that I have, then dismiss me.

230
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,030
Today, the Supreme Council should adopt an official position

231
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,720
that I had nothing to do with Im Gyu Tae's case.

232
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,430
Then...

233
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
<i>Yes, Chairman?</i>

234
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,010
Connect to the BH quickly.

235
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,050
Are you saying you won't dismiss Secretary General Baek?

236
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,450
Chairman, why are you doing this all of sudden?

237
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,390
For now, I understand. I'll call you back.

238
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,660
Assemblyman's prediction was correct.

239
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Party Leader Yoon changed his position.

240
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,150
I just said that. This prediction came from Aide Choi's brain.

241
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,720
I see. The VIP praised her from time to time but

242
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,890
I see that you were worthy of the praise.

243
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,430
Anyway, because of this one loach (bottom-dwelling scavenger fish), whether it's the party or the BH,

244
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,680
face isn't the only thing lost.

245
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,700
Secretary.

246
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,820
Please, relay this to the VIP.

247
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,030
What is this?

248
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:33,060
It's a loach recipe that the Indifferent-to-BH faction made.

249
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,700
Recipe.

250
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,630
<i>Gookmin Party</i>

251
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,370
<i>2015 Gookmin Party's 57th Supreme Council Meeting</i>

252
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,810
<i>On the Agenda: Secretary General Baek Do Hyun's dismissal</i>

253
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,300
Party Leader Yoon's not here yet.

254
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,200
He must have a lot to think about.

255
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,690
Do you really think you can hold out?

256
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,670
Punk, I guess he has something he can count on.

257
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,720
Hello, Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu.

258
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,150
It's been a long time.

259
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,190
You're suffering a lot, Secretary General Baek.

260
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,050
Not at all.

261
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,110
What's the occasion? The main body and Avatar rarely come together.

262
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,910
Are you here to watch?

263
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,620
I came to warn you.

264
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,080
This is a fight between you and the leadership.

265
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,620
Don't threaten us or try to get us involved. You're not the only one with classified info.

266
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,380
I'll keep that in mind.

267
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,910
I wish you luck.

268
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,930
Thank you.

269
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,150
Do as Assemblyman Jin says. That's the right thing to do for the party.

270
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,790
Party Leader, they're just jumping to conclusions by themselves.

271
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,970
Don't let them deceive you.

272
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,790
Jumping to conclusions?

273
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,840
We're aware of both of your involvement in Party Leader Yoon's corruption.

274
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,710
- What?<br>- Did the Blue House really give such information to you?

275
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,370
Yes.

276
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,120
That's a lie. There's no way the Blue House could've done such a thing.

277
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,090
Then shall we head straight to the press conference and expose the truth?

278
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,550
I have nothing to hide. Do whatever you need to do.

279
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,750
I understand.

280
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,300
Choi In Kyung, let's go.

281
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,520
You two ladies. What's so urgent? Wait there for a bit.

282
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,070
Party Leader.

283
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,790
Don't you understand why

284
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,020
I brought this here instead of making this public right away?

285
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,890
Reason? Are you saying you did this for me or what?

286
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,940
Why would I do that for you? I don't even like you that much.

287
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,000
I did it because I don't want to.

288
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,020
You don't want to do what?

289
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,810
I want to be a politician,

290
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,580
not someone who exposes things.

291
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,960
What... expose?

292
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,460
Yes. What I've seen the most ever since I came to the Assembly...
subtitles ripped by riri13

293
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,240
What I saw happening so often that I'm sick and tired... were exposés.

294
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,860
Someone did something to someone, someone swallowed up how much from someone...

295
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,840
Exposing everything and taking everything off and just...

296
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080
Stabbing someone's back... and most of them turn out to be rumors...

297
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,430
and fabrications and... They're all like that.

298
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,430
So?

299
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,420
I've done that a few times myself,

300
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,520
but it's not very good for mental health, and it seems quite addictive, too.

301
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,140
But the bigger problem is that the citizens are really sick and tired of it.

302
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,810
They're really disgusted.

303
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,880
Party Leader. Please do as I say this time.

304
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,490
Let's not commit fraud against the citizens anymore, please?

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

306
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,090
What a nice sight.

307
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,540
I'm not feeling good about this. Do you think the Indifferent-to-BH is cooking up something?

308
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,070
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

309
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,910
From now on, I will open 2015

310
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,250
Gookmin Party's 57th Supreme Council Meeting.

311
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,480
From three members of the supreme committee, a petition for

312
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,290
Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon's dismissal was submitted.

313
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,770
I'll listen to what Secretary General Baek has to say first.

314
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,050
First,

315
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,900
for worrying the party and the citizens due to my chief secretary's offense,

316
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,150
I feel deeply sorry.

317
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,210
But since I have nothing to do with Chief Secretary Im Gyu Tae's crime,

318
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,690
I believe I have no reason to be dismissed.

319
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,320
He sure has a thick face.

320
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,640
If I turn out to have committed even the slightest wrongdoing,

321
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm willing to accept any kind of appropriate legal consequences.

322
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,630
But until then, I would like diligently to fulfill my duty as the Secretary General.

323
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,100
I request that the Honorable Party Leader Yoon Jeong Soo

324
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:15,080
as well as the supreme councilmen make a wise decision. Thank you.

325
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,460
We'll make the final decision.

326
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,300
We will not accept the petition for Secretary General Baek's dismissal.

327
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,050
How despicable.

328
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,170
We will present an urgent matter.

329
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,980
Urgent matter?

330
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,990
Since I became the chairman of the ruling party,

331
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,290
it has been more than 1 year.

332
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,280
During that time, I don't think I fulfilled my promise made to the people and party members

333
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,170
to carry out public office innovation and reform.

334
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:08,570
Besides that, events up to the case of Secretary General's Chief Secretary damaging an assemblyman, etc.

335
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,520
have mired the party in confusion and chaos.

336
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,420
Since I fully realize the heavy responsibility borne by a party leader,

337
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,450
I will resign

338
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,540
the position of party leader.

339
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,320
What? Resignation?

340
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,530
I, also, will do the same as the Chairwoman of the Party.

341
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,330
I will resign too.

342
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,770
What on earth are you doing now? Resignation?

343
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,340
Gookmin Party Regulations Article 172:

344
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,990
If more than a half of the supreme committee resign,

345
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,490
the organization of the party leaders shall be dissolved automatically. Don't you know that?

346
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:50,460
Wow, he doesn't know it yet, because he landed in the Gookmin party only a few days ago.

347
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,160
Then, what is Secretary General Baek going to do?

348
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,550
The leadership of the party is dissolved so there will be no Secretary General.

349
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,100
It will be an auto-resignation.

350
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,000
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.</i>

351
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,360
<i>Yes. President.</i>

352
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,040
<i>I watched how one cooks the loach.</i>

353
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,570
<i> By the way, isn't it too extreme?</i>

354
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,630
<i>Yes. It is extreme but...</i>

355
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,260
<i>I will read what my aide wrote for a moment.</i>

356
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,750
<i>If we are to regain the citizen's confidence in government and the party and</i>

357
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,200
<i>if there is to be stable leadership during the latter half of my term</i>

358
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,870
<i>it would be best for incompetent party leaders and Baek Do Hyeon to resign. That is my opinion.</i>

359
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,510
<i>What are your thoughts?</i>

360
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,670
<i>My thought? Yes. My thought is important too.</i>

361
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,210
<i>My thought is that catching only one loach will be not enough.</i>

362
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,500
<i>After taking out all the water and catching the rest, then we have to refill the water.</i>

363
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,920
<i>Assemblyman! Manners, be polite.</i>

364
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,330
<i>Yes. I think we have to fill the water again.</i>

365
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,580
<i>Yes. I understand. If you rely on us,</i>

366
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,320
<i>we will try to do it.</i>

367
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,380
<i>Yes. Goodbye, President.</i>

368
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,510
Aide Choi.

369
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,580
You, too.

370
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,660
Citizens.

371
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,240
We are sorry.

372
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,130
<i>Following the resignation of the Gookmin Party leadership,</i>

373
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,230
<i>the party will temporarily be run by an Ad-Hoc Committee.</i>

374
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,890
<i>Floor Leader Choe Joon Goo, who is acting head of the Gookmin Party,</i>

375
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,130
<i>revealed at a press briefing</i>

376
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,690
<i>that a convention to elect the party's leadership will be held</i>

377
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,070
<i>either at the end of the regular legislative session in December</i>

378
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,750
<i>or in January next year.</i>

379
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,590
<i>... is something especially different. <br>Our Indifferent-to-BH's position is firm.</i>

380
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,770
<i>Meanwhile, Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon, who is suspected of suborning perjury by the President of Hanmin International Bank,</i>

381
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,010
<i>appeared behind closed doors to be examined by the prosecutor</i>

382
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,170
<i>and then returned home today.</i>

383
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,730
<i>It is known that Assemblyman Baek flatly denies the allegations against him, but </i>

384
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,890
<i>the prosecution intends to carry out an intensive investigation</i>

385
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,110
<i>by summoning him again to confront Mr. Im.</i>

386
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,830
<i>Once called the Seo Dae Han Administration's Crown Prince</i>

387
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,470
<i>and classified as a next-term candidate for President, </i>

388
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,950
<i>Assemblyman Baek is on the brink of becoming a political pariah.</i>

389
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,950
<i>Assemblyman.</i>

390
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,970
<i>You didn't go to bed?</i>

391
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,410
<i>Yes. I have something to do.</i>

392
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,790
<i>Oh.</i>

393
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,310
<i>You really are trying to make something?</i>

394
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,070
<i>Yes.</i>

395
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,050
<i>But what kind of bill?</i>

396
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,250
<i>Just... I want to make a law</i>

397
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,910
<i>for the ordinary dads of this world.</i>

398
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,350
<i>Huh?</i>

399
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,810
<i>But since I don't know what to do, it is possible I might not make it.</i>

400
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,390
<i>I think I still won't be able to draft it.</i>

401
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,530
Assemblyman Jin.

402
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,510
Gyu Hwan didn't show up now.

403
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,810
But why?

404
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,290
I don't know what.

405
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,390
He didn't enroll this month.

406
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,230
Actually when you were in jail, Aide Choi met with him.

407
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,050
-Aide Choie did? <br> - Yes.

408
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,070
She asked him to come back to your office,

409
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,370
but he refused.

410
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,210
But why?

411
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,510
Even when he hears the "po" in "politics"

412
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,450
he told her it makes him sick.

413
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,630
What she said is it seems he feels remorse because you were arrested.

414
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,770
He has become more cynical.

415
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,050
Honestly, I'm concerned.

416
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,850
Okay. I understand.

417
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,130
Thank you for telling me.

418
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,950
But... Aide Choi said you would worry

419
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,110
so I was absolutely never to tell you.

420
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,330
If you were to say I told you,

421
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,470
But why is everyone more afraid of her than me?

422
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,570
Just the sound of her bawling you out terrifies you.

423
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,030
You're a hopeless wuss. A wuss! What is so scary...

424
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,650
Oh.

425
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,290
Aide Choi.

426
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,210
Assemblyman, is is true the money you received while in prison was given to the prisoneers?

427
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,250
Ah, that money?

428
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,050
Yes, I... that...

429
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,450
I bought and shared tasty side dishes too with those around me...

430
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,450
That money would have paid the car rent expense for a month.

431
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,330
Did you think we were in a position to be helping others?

432
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,590
That's true. I know, but I felt sorry that I was being released from prison first...

433
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,610
I'm sorry. I forgot that.

434
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,990
Secretary Song, what are you doing here?

435
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,470
What? Ah I was... asking for advice about life.

436
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,330
Assemblyman. Thank you for the wise advice.

437
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,870
Yeah. Okay.

438
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,510
Ask anytime. About living life.

439
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,870
Yes.

440
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,610
What are you saying?

441
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,310
Aigo. Life...

442
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,870
She's still an adolescent. <br> What now?

443
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,630
While checking the documents seized by the prosecutor

444
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,150
I found a file.

445
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,130
What is this?

446
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,400
It's the bill which Secretary Kim drafted.

447
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,140
<i> A Proposed Bill re: A Second Chance</i>

448
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Is this everything?

449
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,200
Yes.

450
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,580
A Second Chance?

451
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,500
So random. What the heck does "Second Chance" mean?

452
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,020
I doo have never heard of this before.

453
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,660
Hey Song. Did you do an internet search?

454
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,960
Yes. I tired, but there isn't anything much.

455
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,700
It's just some scribbling.

456
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,740
Because Secretary Kim drafted it

457
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,140
could if have something to do with his father?

458
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,740
I knew it! I knew it!

459
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,860
That's surprising.

460
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,440
When Hyung Dal Soo got divorced he lived life like a widower.

461
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,180
So isn't the bill made for people who live alone and those who remarry?

462
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,240
What does the law have to do with that?

463
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,760
You hook up with someone and live together.

464
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,820
What are you up to?

465
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,300
Speaking of which, we also should have a comeback together.

466
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,880
Have I even had a first?

467
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Jeez. Stop making a fool of yourself in front of the staff.

468
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,200
This feeling is a first for me too.

469
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,340
There's something I figured out.

470
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,960
Is there?

471
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,340
I knew you are a computer, really.

472
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,260
Secretary Kim. He wasnted to make a law about a consolation prize for losers.

473
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,000
Consolation prize?

474
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,300
<i>Just... I want to draft a bill for the ordinary dads of this world.</i>

475
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,340
But then, how did you know what it is by looking at the title?

476
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,140
A long time ago there was someone similar <br>who drafted a bill like this.

477
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,020
A long time ago?

478
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,400
Yes.

479
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,420
Chief Secretary Im... Has it been really hard?

480
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,600
It's unfortunate you are in detention.

481
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,080
I will do my best to prevent somehow your serving a prison sentence.

482
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,080
Will you go so far as a suspended sentence?

483
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,780
Do it as quickly as possible.

484
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,920
It would be great if it was a minimum sentence.

485
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,700
I will claim substantial compensation after I get out.

486
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,620
- Chief Secretary Im. <br> - Don't forget

487
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,940
your political life

488
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,120
depends on this.

489
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,680
<i>Let's make a consolation prize law.</i>

490
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,780
<i>Consolation prize law?</i>

491
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,820
<i>Think about it. You have multiple competitions in this world and</i>

492
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,780
<i>competition by necessity has winners and losers.</i>

493
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,600
<i>When there is only a reward for the winner without any consideration for the loser,</i>

494
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,160
<i>how far can the world go?</i>

495
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,100
<i>How do you intend to show consideration for the losers?</i>

496
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,520
<i>By giving a belief that life is not over after you have lost once.</i>

497
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,320
<i>How will that be done?</i>

498
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,020
<i>By giving an opportunity to try again.</i>

499
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,800
<i>A Second Chance.</i>

500
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:20,160
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

501
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,210
<i>Eight years ago. Do you remember the Second Chance Bill,</i>

502
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,900
<i>which was not submitted to the Assembly<br> because the party's policy panel opposed it?</i>

503
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,860
<i>That was your original resolution.</i>

504
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:49,700
<i>I am looking forward to seeing you admit <br>your past mistakes and making a fresh start.</i>

505
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,370
Secretary Lee.

506
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,930
Please make a U-turn at the next light.

507
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,720
Yes, Assemblyman.

508
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,720
Yes.

509
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,870
Hankook University Professor Park Young Sam and Attorney Yoon Sun Hae seem to be strong candidates to chair the Emergency Response Commission (ERC).

510
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,850
Really?

511
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,360
They would be okay.

512
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,300
How did they decide to make up the Emergency Response Commission (ERC)?

513
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,410
One from each faction and the rest will be filled by public figures from outside.

514
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,420
One per faction, does that include the Indifferent-to-BH faction?

515
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,260
Just get ready to print new business cards for Assemblyman Jin.

516
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,320
Assemblyman.

517
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,360
Aren't you happy? An Emergency Response Commission member is at the same level as a supreme councilman.

518
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,300
Can't you just do it, Assemblywoman Hong?

519
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,890
But I am in the National Election Commission's clutches over a political contribution issue.

520
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,400
People will cuss me out, saying I haven't come to my senses yet.

521
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,960
I guess you're like this because you feel uncomfortable about factions divvying up the positions.

522
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,710
But this is an emergency. You have to be there to counterbalance the Pro- and Anti-BH

523
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,480
and to help out the chairperson coming from outside.

524
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,850
I really don't feel like it. The very sound of it is unattractive, Bidet... (Korean pronunciation sounds like toilet seat or obese)

525
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:24,550
If you won't do this either, I will really quit this office.

526
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,050
Why do you bring up this unnecessary topic again.

527
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,200
I really mean it.

528
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,690
Why are you like this again, scaring me...

529
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,620
If you're scared, be an ERC member!

530
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,230
Ah, I got it. I will do it.

531
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,950
Really?

532
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,120
Ah, yeah...

533
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,710
You should have done this earlier.

534
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,930
Assemblyman Jin.

535
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,890
Yes?

536
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:54,370
As the old saying goes, never hang on to a daughter-in-law or an aide who wants to leave.

537
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,300
Should I introduce you to a very capable aide?

538
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,720
Oh, well, can you do that for me? Even better

539
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,630
if the person doesn't engage in drunk drivel and is amiable.

540
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,410
That kind of person is a dime a dozen in the Assembly Hall. The age group?

541
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,840
The younger, the better... I guess.

542
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,490
If you are going to buy a skirt anyway, go for the vermillion one (prettier, better one). Trends cannot be ignored in politics.

543
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,950
A guy would be better. I can go to the bathhouse with him and we can scrub each other's backs.

544
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,390
Guy? Bathhouse...

545
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,550
Do it.

546
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,400
What? You want me to step down from the Strategy and Finance Committee chair position?

547
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,130
But, why are you saying this out of the blue?

548
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,290
Just quit if I tell you to quit.

549
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,710
But, this old man, has he gone senile?

550
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:52,150
Assemblyman Park, do you know how meaty that position is?

551
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:57,380
Do you know how much I wined and dined assemblymen to occupy that seat?

552
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,080
Assemblyman Kang.

553
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,900
You will have to take our seat on the ERC.

554
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,590
Ah, well, ERC...

555
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,570
Emergency Response Commission member? Me?!

556
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,610
It's about time that you take a party position.

557
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,670
Do well.

558
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,640
Oh...

559
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,720
Assemblyman Park, thank you very much! I will work hard!

560
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,430
Yes, work hard.

561
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,740
Yes, yes, yes.

562
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,700
A glory to my family.

563
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,090
Assemblyman Park.

564
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:51,870
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

565
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Go to the investigating authorities and promptly admit the charges.

566
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,700
Hiding behind an aide is not something an old hand should do.

567
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,280
I intend to get Mr. Im Gyu Tae out as soon as possible.

568
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,550
Do you have that kind of power still remaining in your hands?

569
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,880
I will have to regain it.

570
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,630
Because one defeat does not mean no second chance.

571
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,830
It is getting late.

572
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,990
Why don't you go back now?

573
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,490
Actually, I

574
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,340
have a very dangerous item in my hands.

575
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,010
But it is also an item

576
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,740
you would covet a lot if you saw it.

577
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,050
What is that?

578
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:46,650
Presidential election funds that were not reported to the National Election Commission.

579
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,840
If you help me with my comeback, I will gladly give it to you.

580
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,170
Oppa, it's me, Joo Hee. Have you been well?

581
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,510
Yes, go on.

582
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,230
Aigo, really, so gruff. When you answered only after one million calls.

583
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,830
Sorry. I've been a bit busy. What's up?

584
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,890
Oppa, what are you doing tomorrow? If you have nothing to do, would you like to go to a PC room with me?

585
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:01,700
Oppa, I am dying of boredom nowadays.

586
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,470
But I have so much to do lately. I don't have time to play with you.

587
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,940
Ah, really. I wouldn't ask you for this kind of favor if only my dad lived with me.

588
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,520
- Joo Hee<br>- Huh?

589
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,280
I'm sorry but don't call me in the future.

590
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,480
Don't text me either.

591
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,280
Um, I got it.

592
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,070
Good-bye.

593
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,290
Oppa!

594
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,110
Really just one game, okay?

595
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:47,120
Okay. Just one game. Let's go!

596
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,070
You could be a pro gamer. How can you move your hands so fast?

597
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,760
It's because I did martial arts, why?

598
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,800
Ah... I want to play with you like this everyday.

599
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,360
- Joo Hee.<br>- Yes?

600
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,980
I have an exam coming up soon. So don't call me for a while, okay?

601
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,630
I understand.

602
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,980
I will leave first.

603
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,370
Uh huh. Good-bye.

604
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,620
Yes, Aide Choi.

605
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,070
Assemblyman, where are you right now? Hurry and come back.

606
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,490
Why? Did something happen?

607
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,400
The atmosphere is ominous.

608
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,980
Assemblyman.

609
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,530
What's the matter?

610
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,200
The deputy party leader had an emergency meeting with the floor leaders.

611
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,130
A rumor is circulating that they are going to announce the members of the Emergency Response Commission.

612
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,000
Without consulting us, just among themselves? Where is Assemblywoman Hong?

613
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,730
She went to the meeting place but was refused entrance because they said it was private.

614
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,230
These people, really.

615
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,220
Assemblyman.

616
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,700
Assemblywoman, what happened?

617
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,630
We got shafted.

618
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,800
I am Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho who has been

619
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,770
selected as a member of Gookmin Party's Emergency Response Commission.

620
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:44,250
I will tell you the names of the five people

621
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,830
who were finalized as the ERC members today.

622
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,920
As members from outside the Party,

623
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,280
former Supreme Court Justice Park Joo Young, Professor Jo Jeong Hwa,

624
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,040
these two people were appointed.

625
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,170
And as inside members, I, Kang Sang Ho,

626
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,580
and Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon were chosen.

627
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,250
What the heck is this?

628
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:28,780
Assemblyman! But isn't Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon currently being investigated by prosecutors?

629
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,210
Oh,

630
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,440
but he is neither indicted nor

631
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,510
are his charges proven, right?

632
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:40,120
I will continue and announce the chairperson

633
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,800
of the ERC that everyone is curious about.

634
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,020
Until the next party convention, the chairperson

635
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,500
who will lead our Gookmin Party's

636
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,320
Emergency Response Commission is...

637
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,190
Assemblyman Park Choon Seop.

638
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,040
<i>Emergency Response Commission Chairman Park Choon Seop</i>

639
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,820
Assemblyman Park.

640
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,510
You seized the party leadership. Congratulations.

641
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,540
Congratulations on your comeback.

642
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,010
Let us work well together in the future.

643
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,190
Please take care of me.

644
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:37,940
There definitely was a certain deal among Baek Do Hyeon, Park Choon Seop and the BH.

645
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,800
Cornered Baek Do Hyeon must have offered something

646
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,820
while pushing Park Choon Seop as the chairman of the Emergency Response Commission.

647
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,990
What is that?

648
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:50,130
Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon oversaw the affairs of the past presidential election.

649
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,490
- For sure...<br>- The election-related funds?

650
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,050
Yes, that must be it.

651
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:02,110
I will further analyze the situation and come up with a counter-strategy as soon as possible.

652
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,900
Just let it be.

653
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,670
What?

654
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,700
No matter what foolery the Pro- and Anti-BH factions engage in,

655
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,970
let us just do the work that we have do.

656
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,290
Assemblyman, I understand that you are disheartened.

657
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,620
But because of Assemblyman Baek's power hunger,

658
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,690
the leadership of the ruling party fell into the hands of the tired old power.

659
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,810
Are you saying we should ignore it?

660
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,630
I'm not saying this because I'm disheartened.

661
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,110
Nor am I ignoring it.

662
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,070
I just want to stop exchanging blows and fighting.

663
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,350
I want to start doing real politics.

664
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,150
What is the real politics you have in mind?

665
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,610
Lawmaking.

666
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:50,950
Assemblymen are not fighters.

667
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,390
They are lawmakers.

668
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:03,870
They are elected so that they can make good laws that would better the people's lives even by a slight degree.

669
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:11,270
But look. How much remains of the regular session now?

670
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,790
Not much.

671
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,720
Aide Choi.

672
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,660
Assemblywoman Hong.

673
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,050
No matter what foolery other people engage in,

674
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:33,270
let us just go our way, okay?

675
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:37,650
Yes, let's.

676
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,270
Yes.

677
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,050
I was short-sighted.

678
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,570
I am sorry.

679
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,450
Gyu Hwan.

680
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:07,650
Assemblyman.

681
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,750
What are you doing here right now?

682
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,370
When you should be studying, what are you doing here?

683
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,510
I am doing this so I can study.

684
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,110
What?

685
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,120
Leave. The business will be open soon.

686
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,540
Hey, did Hyung Dal Soo also know about what a troublemaker you are?

687
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,960
Don't bring up father.

688
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,420
I still

689
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,720
cannot laugh and talk about him with you.

690
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,180
Leave. The owner will be here soon.

691
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,320
Leave what, punk?

692
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,220
Call him and tell him you're quitting.

693
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,160
And register as an intern again.

694
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,800
I won't make you work overtime, so you can attend a night school, got it?

695
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,980
Let's go.

696
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,770
I have no thought of that. Just leave.

697
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,270
Let's go, punk.

698
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,880
Didn't I tell you I don't want to?

699
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,660
Listen to me, please, punk!

700
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,640
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

701
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,240
Because I'm Bae Gyu Hwan?

702
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,940
Because you think you can erase your guilt towards my father this way?

703
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:38,160
I don't need all this almsgiving.

704
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
So just go.

705
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,460
Yes, punk, it's because you're Bae Gyu Hwan.

706
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,740
So I want to show you, that's why.

707
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,340
You, punk, said just the sound of "po" in "politics" makes you retch.

708
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:57,740
So let's go. I will show you what real politics is.

709
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,760
Stick by my side and watch.

710
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,790
Got it?

711
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,610
Chairman, Jin Sang Pil is giving a news conference right now.

712
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:21,770
This fellah... did he catch on somehow?

713
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,120
<i>Yes, I am People's Spoilsport Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, the big boss of Gookmin Party's Indifferent-to-BH faction.</i>

714
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,740
The reason I am here today...

715
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,960
is not to expose something.

716
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,500
Nor am I here to criticize the Pro- and Anti-BH factions suddenly being very buddy-buddy lately.

717
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,320
<i>My purpose for being here today is to introduce</i>

718
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,940
a bill that I must absolutely, undoubtedly

719
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:00,220
pass during this regular session of the Assembly.

720
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,310
What the...

721
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,610
Yes, I know.

722
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:12,090
That this kind of story is not newsworthy, I do know.

723
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,670
But you have to publicize these kinds of stories too

724
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:21,690
so that we assemblymen would try to make even better laws.

725
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,070
It won't take much of your time, so listen carefully

726
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,090
and I hope you report a lot about it.

727
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,200
Ms. Choi In Kyung, over there...

728
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,660
Yes, the bill I will primarily sponsor this time

729
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,260
is one that allows our country and society to support,

730
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:04,220
and to extend a helping hand to those among our countrymen

731
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:16,410
who could not help but fall down, despite having done their utmost to live diligently.

732
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:26,780
Namely, a bill to support giving a second chance to those who have lost.

733
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,380
But what kind of bill name is like that?

734
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,300
Just by hearing it, I can tell it's about populism.

735
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,680
All the while I was making this bill,

736
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:04,500
there was a person who did not leave my thoughts even for one moment.

737
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,400
That person worked harder than anybody else.

738
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,760
He was more conscientious than anybody else.

739
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,780
And more than anybody else,

740
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,020
he was a really great father.

741
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:31,190
But because of just one defeat,

742
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,950
because of that defeat,

743
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,390
he was a person

744
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,490
who broke down so helplessly, so painfully.

745
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:51,370
If to that person, just one more chance had been given,

746
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:59,720
no, even if he could have had a belief that one more chance would be given to him,

747
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:06,650
in my opinion, I absolutely believe

748
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:13,230
that he would not have climbed that tall crane.

749
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,730
That person is...

750
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,710
Even though some of you might remember, probably

751
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:24,750
almost everyone must have forgotten him, probably so.

752
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,650
The late Mr. Bae Dal Soo,

753
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,710
the laid-off worker from Korea Shipbuilding &amp; Repairs Co.

754
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,470
Assemblyman...

755
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,670
has bet even his life on this bill.

756
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,710
If something goes wrong, that will be your responsibility.

757
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,350
Yes, so for me, the real name of this bill is

758
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,390
Bae Dal Soo,

759
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,750
yes, it's Bae Dal Soo's Law.

760
