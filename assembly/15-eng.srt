<i>All characters, party names, and incidents appearing in this drama are fictitious creations.</i>

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,740
Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi was pissed.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,590
How are other members reacting to Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu's enrollment?

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,870
The response was not good.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,290
They will like it when they see the things happening in the future.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,120
What?

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,770
We've transferred in the new student.

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,990
Now we have to take care of the troublemaker.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,620
Jin Sang Pil... I will expel him from the party.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,870
For sure.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,090
<i>Episode 15</i>

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,330
Gisong Island is our country's iconic migratory bird sanctuary.

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,870
Every year, tens of thousands of birds flock to the wintering grounds

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,230
and more than 30 of the world's rarest species can be observed there.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,150
What do you mean you want to build a massive resort there?

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,910
Not there but next to it...

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,290
- Vice Minister of Ministry of Environment.<br>- Yes.

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,070
This is an issue that is directly related to the raison d'être of the Ministry of Environment.

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,540
You can never endorse the Environmental Impact Assessment.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,410
Man cannot be the only species populating the earth.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,250
Animals have to live too and plants too. We all have to co-exist.

22
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,260
That way, we can achieve that sustainable development or whatever.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,700
As Assemblywomen Cheon said, the Ministry of Environment should

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,220
firmly intervene.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,230
Yes, after a careful review...

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,140
Point of order.

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,080
"Don't endorse the Environmental Impact Assessment."

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,930
"Intervene."

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,700
These are obviously and explicitly pejorative words.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,740
At this rate, how can the Ministry of Environment work in a principled way

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,250
and conduct an unbiased review?

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,160
I request your retraction of the statements.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,430
Assemblyman Jo, since when did you belong to the ruling party to side with it?

34
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,620
Be ashamed of yourself.

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,330
Please also retract your ad hominem statement toward a fellow assemblyman.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,470
I too raise a point of order.

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,390
Vice Minister, please come to our Gookmin Party to do an environmental assessment.

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,390
- Excuse me?<br>- Our party is supposedly a newly rising migratory bird habitat.

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,870
And supposedly we have a strange bird, too, which thinks of itself as an assemblyman.

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,440
You know ornithologists? Please bring them on your visit.

41
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,900
Please come without fail. Please I beg you.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,830
How can you spit out whatever comes to your mind like that?

43
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,390
Did you see the meeting?

44
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,580
Assemblyman Jo is holding it in because he has a twinge of conscience.

45
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,910
What do you think would have happened with another assemblyman?

46
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,850
They would have raised a ruckus about taking you to a disciplinary action or suing you for slander.

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,000
Would I have said such a thing to another fellah?

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,930
It was because Jo Woong Bird spoke too brashly like that.

49
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,100
Don't even mouth the words of Gookmin Party being a migratory bird habitat.

50
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,260
You must refrain from all statements provoking the party for the time being.

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,150
- Why?<br>- With Assemblyman Jo's enrollment, the ratio of the ruling and opposition party seats changed to 152:148.

52
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,550
The swing vote, the Indifferent-to-BH faction's sole weapon, is gone!

53
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,120
So you are saying even if I'm kicked out of the party, the majority government by the ruling party will be maintained.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,370
That is right.

55
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,370
Even though we look very serene on the outside, the Indifferent-to-BH faction is facing a very serious crisis.

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,430
- Aide Choi, it seems like you don't know much now.<br>- What?

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,280
Why is the swing vote the Indifferent-to-BH faction's sole weapon?

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,500
When we have secret weapons?

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,790
Flame Man, JSP.

60
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,700
And Aide Choi and Kids.

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,040
The only solution is to recruit a new assemblyman into the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,370
Unless that person is out of his mind, who would want to join the Indifferent-to-BH faction?

63
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,410
That is right, though. If they come, it's not like some special benefit will be waiting... was what you were going to say, right?

64
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,620
But lately, there is a person in the Gookmin Party who has lost her grasp on reality.

65
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,670
- Who?<br>- Who do you think it is?

66
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,080
Madam Hong?

67
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,300
<i>Stop shoddy construction, waste of budget, and environmental destruction!</i>

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,000
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
<i>- Stop shoddy construction!<br>- Stop it! Stop it!</i>

70
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,180
<i>Stop shoddy construction, waste of budget, and environmental destruction!</i>

71
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,160
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>Stop shoddy construction, waste of budget and environmental destruction! Stop it!</i>

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,000
Madam Hong?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Party Leader Yoon Jeong Soo is said to have taken umbrage at Assemblyman Jin's migratory bird habitat comment.

75
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,080
But we can't sanction him for that alone. We may get a media whiplash that way.

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,890
Secretary General, how about using the method I proposed...

77
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,950
No, that is too risky.

78
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,140
I'd like to hear your explanation about the election of the party chapter head in Seogyeong City Gap Voting District.

79
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,440
Secretary Lim, you may leave.

80
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,370
Please have a seat.

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,290
- Answer me first.<br>- Assemblywoman Hong.

82
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,150
If only you had given me some support,

83
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,510
I would not have lost so shamefully.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,430
What is the reason you didn't help me?

85
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,500
<i>Tell Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi to schedule meetings with Assembly news desk chairs.</i>

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,160
<i>But... I can't get in touch with Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

87
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,700
<i>I think an order has been handed down from the Blue House.</i>

88
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,620
The secretary general is a position that cannot and must not interfere with any election within the party.

89
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,000
Secretary General Baek!

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,950
Humbly accept the outcome.

91
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,390
The reason for your defeat was not lack of my help.

92
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,110
But would it not be because you failed to capture the party members' hearts?

93
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,660
I will cut to the chase. The possibility of my getting next year's nomination for the Seogyeong City Gap Voting District,

94
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,910
is there any remaining?

95
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,450
No, I will revise my question.

96
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:55,540
Inside you, is there any intent to give me a nomination?

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,900
That is enough for today.

98
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,950
I have done my best for you for the last four years.

99
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,160
Is this how you repay me?

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,200
Assemblywoman Hong.

101
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,790
When you were getting pressured by the Blue House to resign,

102
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,690
who appeared in this room first and shielded you...

103
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,950
Have you already forgotten about it?

104
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:34,820
You came to visit me in this room that day in order to shield me?

105
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,750
Yes.

106
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,500
Assemblywoman Hong, you merely got in my line.

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,580
- What?<br>- Rather than from Jin Sang Pil,

108
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,820
it would be far easier to get a nomination from the Baek Do Hyeon Secretariat. Such a thoroughly political calculation.

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,290
The subject toward whom you did your best for the last four years

110
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,420
was not Baek Do Hyeon, but a nomination. Can you deny that?

111
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,000
For whatever term that remains, have some faith in the voting district

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,870
and faithfully carry out your duties as a proportional representative.

113
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,760
Just do it while I'm telling you nicely.

114
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,420
- I don't want to.<br>- Let's do it.

115
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,150
- I said I don't want to.<br>- Why don't we listen and be obedient?

116
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,410
You'll have to talk sense before I will listen.

117
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,790
Why is this nonsense?

118
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,120
Go outside and ask the secretaries...

119
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,490
whether seducing Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi to join the Indifferent-to-BH faction makes any sense.

120
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,050
But the only recruitable person right now is Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi.

121
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,410
Still, you have to look before you leap.

122
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,660
Just leap anywhere, when a viper is there? You'll get snapped at, bitten!

123
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,050
Even though Assemblywoman Hong has become too puffed up after sudden success at a young age,

124
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,690
originally she was a rather sensible woman.

125
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,730
Don't just say no but rise to the challenge.

126
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,330
Challenge what? I hate the idea.

127
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,450
Seriously!

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,290
- Let's do it already.<br>- If you are so desperate, you can just go and do it!

129
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,290
Go and do it! Valiantly!

130
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,920
I can't do it because I'm scared. Of getting bitten. I will never do it!

131
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,330
If you keep doing this, I will disregard our ranks again.

132
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,540
You just try disregarding ranks, really.

133
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,950
The last time, I overlooked it because you were drunk, not because you were a girl.

134
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,750
And do you even know how heavy you are...

135
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,830
Where are you going in the middle of the conversation!

136
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,010
I have to go self-wash the car. It's really dirty.

137
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,010
So why did you send Secretary Byeon on a vacation, when we are dying from overwork!

138
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,370
<i>Civil Service Exam Prep School Signs</i>

139
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,200
Aish, really...

140
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,830
How can there be so many civil servant schools?

141
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,450
At this rate, everyone will become a civil servant...

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,140
Work hard.

143
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,850
Hyung, why does it takes days for you to find one person?

144
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,250
Hyung, are you perhaps screwing around somewhere?

145
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,080
Are you going to keep saying those things that get to me?

146
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,310
Hey. Do you really think Secretary Kim is around here?

147
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,530
To me, I don't think he's here.

148
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,760
He told Aide Choi by email that

149
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,100
he was with his buddies who studied together for the police exam.

150
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,000
So, hurry up and find him. Don't contact me until you find him. Jeez.

151
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,920
Hey, Sang Pil. Hey. Hey.

152
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,490
Why is it so hard to find one person?

153
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,840
<i>Hong Chan Mi<br>Assemblywoman</i>

154
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,400
<i>The only person we can recruit now is Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

155
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,390
Why are you loitering around another assemblyman's office?

156
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,790
I wasn't loitering. Since you are just across from me, I was wondering how you were doing and such.

157
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,820
Step aside.

158
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,800
Assemblywoman Hong.

159
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,600
I... about the committee chairperson election,

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,710
I know about it.

161
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,590
So? You came to congratulate someone when they're mourning?

162
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,450
No. That's nonsense.

163
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,130
If you are inclined,

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,900
in Indifferent-to-BH faction, there is this one good position.

165
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,380
Maybe you can come into our faction...

166
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,390
-What did you say?<br>-It's not that I am trying to belittle you.

167
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,450
As for me, with sincerity...

168
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,900
If I go in, what are you going to do for me?

169
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,500
What?

170
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,460
Are you able to give me a nomination?

171
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,080
Come on, that would be hard for me.

172
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,290
What about political funds?

173
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,590
What about an executive party position or an organization?

174
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,720
All of that I can't...

175
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,180
Then, shut that mouth of yours.

176
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,150
But honestly, if you come into the Indifferent-to-BH faction,

177
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,360
guaranteed monthly income, room and board, things like that are impossible, but...

178
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,950
-You will suffer like a dog but...<br>-Stop!

179
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,870
But since both of us are in the same situation...

180
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,030
Stop. Stop and shut your mouth! Shut it!

181
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,830
If you ever start talking about frivolous things again,

182
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,900
then, you'll end up dying and I'll end up dying.

183
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,470
Did you see that just now?

184
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,860
Did you see the venomous snake ripping me to shreds?

185
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,370
You knew you couldn't get her to join, so you made me do it.

186
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,600
I was so scared, my smile muscles atrophied.

187
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Welcome, Assemblyman Kang.

188
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,590
So, what brings you here?

189
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:50,410
A while ago, during the Secretary General upheaval,

190
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,870
I heard that there was something promised between you and our Assemblyman Park.

191
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Are you talking about increasing the Anti-BH share to 40% in next year's general election?

192
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,990
Yes, as it's an important matter,

193
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,970
either a memorandum or written promise

194
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,420
would put him at ease, he said.

195
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,460
His personality is not by nature that meticulous.

196
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,890
But Secretary General Baek, you've been doing a lot of backstabbing.

197
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,200
That's why he's being this way. So you'll understand and write one, right?

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,500
Assemblyman Park, Baek Do Hyeon asks for a little more time.

199
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,740
I guess he's afraid that he might fall into our trap.

200
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,160
Don't worry.

201
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,990
I will punch in at his office every day to badger him.

202
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,560
And if things don't work out, I will just punch him.

203
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,630
Hello.

204
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,510
To what do I owe this honor, Assemblywoman Hong?

205
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,810
I have something important to tell you face to face.

206
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,090
Oh, yes, I understand. Then I will see you there.

207
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,510
By Assemblywoman Hong, do you mean Hong Chan Mi?

208
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,320
She says she has something important to say.

209
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,460
Important my butt.

210
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,600
She got used and ditched by Baek Do Hyeon.

211
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,400
It's obvious that she will ask us take her in.

212
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:37,470
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

213
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,230
Secretary General.

214
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,920
Why are you here?

215
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,860
Assemblyman Park Choon Seop asked me to relay this message to you.

216
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,240
He is having a hard time as it is to take care of current family members.

217
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,780
He's not in a position to accept a new family member.

218
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,460
I will overlook this for old times' sake.

219
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,830
But you'd better be more judicious in the future.

220
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,250
Since you brought up old times,

221
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,290
let me just ask you one question.

222
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,160
During the last 4 years, what was I to you, Secretary General?

223
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,700
A butler or a trainbearer?

224
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,270
If neither, a dog that barks on command?

225
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,730
If I have to put it into words, probably a partner.

226
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,500
Who can always be contractually terminated if she fails to meet the profit goals.

227
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:51,160
So it was like that, after all. When I considered you a comrade.

228
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:59,090
Assemblywoman Hong, a comrade refers to a person

229
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,510
who will gladly accompany you any time through thick and thin.

230
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,860
If it's Choi In Kyung, then maybe.

231
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,760
So till the end, you are talking about Choi In Kyung.

232
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,800
That word "comrade" does not fit you, Assemblywoman Hong.

233
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,700
Secretary Baek! No, you! You underestimated me. <br><i> (The form of "you" rather than his name is an insult.)</i>

234
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,380
You will end up regretting this.

235
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,720
So it is a word that describes the relationship between an act and the law.

236
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,990
Commonly, legality means...

237
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,260
Maybe it's because I know now. He's a spitting image of his father when he was young.

238
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,490
They say becoming a civil servant is like plucking a star out of the sky.

239
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,860
Will he do well?

240
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,450
Let's go now.

241
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,860
And not see Secretary Kim?

242
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,480
It's enough that I've seen him doing well.

243
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,230
How can you make me work like a dog for several days just so that you can see his face, huh?

244
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,490
I am sorry, Hyung.

245
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,500
<i>Could you give me some time? Hong Chan Mi.</i>

246
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,530
Why, is Aide Choi giving you a hard time again?

247
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,760
I was rude to you earlier. I am sorry.

248
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,450
Aigo, well, I didn't do anything commendable either. Just ended up rubbing it in...

249
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,610
I am sorry, too.

250
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,350
The reason I asked to see you

251
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,670
is to add to the Indifferent-to-BH faction's track record.

252
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,240
Track record? What track record?

253
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,780
Just promise me one thing.

254
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,620
The information I am about to give you now,

255
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,530
not to tell anyone that you got it from me.

256
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,430
But at least to our Aide Choi --

257
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,600
I have to say it.

258
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,940
Then consider this never happened.

259
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,730
You can turn back.

260
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,690
What is it, so you're like this?

261
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,680
Promise me first.

262
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,490
But I'll get into big trouble.

263
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,260
Okay, I will promise.

264
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,540
You mean it?

265
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,290
Have you been tricked all your life? Yes, I will promise.

266
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,390
What is it?

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,730
<i>An allegation about cutting up the nomination pie along the faction lines in Gookmin Party...</i>

268
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,410
<i>You should not have done as you wished. You should have consulted with me first!</i>

269
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,230
<i>- I can no longer do it.<br>- Aide Choi!</i>

270
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,410
<i>I can't do it!<br>No way!</i>

271
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,190
Good morning!

272
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,530
Did you have a good vacation?

273
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:26,200
What vacation? I've come back from studying to death.

274
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,700
- Study?<br>- You must have studied oriental paintings (Go-stop game).

275
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,190
Right, right.

276
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,020
The Assemblyman didn't come up with you?

277
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,280
Assemblyman Jin is holding a press conference in the Media Hall now.

278
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,870
- What press conference?<br>- How would I know what even you don't know?

279
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,660
Pro-BH faction's Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon and Anti-BH faction's Assemblyman Park Choon Seop

280
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,330
had a closed-door meeting during the Secretary General's resignation scandal

281
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,700
and, in return for their support of Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon keeping the secretary general position,

282
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,370
agreed to cut up the nomination pie along faction lines for the next general election.

283
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,250
The gist was

284
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,290
to enlarge the Anti-BH's share, which currently makes up

285
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,500
<i>35% of the incumbent party assemblymen, to 40%.</i>

286
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,760
Has Assemblyman Jin scored another one again?

287
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,580
That is not just one score, but it's a mega-ton nuclear bomb.

288
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,040
At this juncture when a special committee to reform the party nomination system is actively working,

289
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,830
the leaders of these two factions were meeting behind closed doors and colluding this way.

290
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,000
In a nutshell, this was a textbook case of the old-school, anti-democratic,

291
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,580
backward-looking politics that undermines democracy.

292
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,980
Wake up. The people are watching.

293
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,660
<i>Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon and Assemblyman Park Choon Seop,</i>

294
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,700
<i>explain yourselves before the people right away.</i>

295
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,550
<i>That is all.</i>

296
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,120
Yes?

297
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,490
By this, what are you trying to pull now?

298
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,930
I am in the middle of investigating the circumstances under which this came to pass myself.

299
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,250
The circumstances or whatever, I am telling you in no uncertain terms.

300
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,450
If this agreement was all for naught, you won't be safe yourself.

301
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,150
Assemblyman Park, don't you think Baek Do Hyeon passed on the information

302
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,470
to Jin Sang Pil so as not to give us a written promise?

303
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,420
Do Hyeon, was Jin Sang Pil's disclosure true?

304
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,050
Whether it's true or not, put out urgent fires first.

305
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,000
Don't give reporters time to exercise their powers of imagination.

306
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,030
Make an immediate announcement that it is baseless.

307
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,700
How come it's quiet... Is it a situation where she's praising him for a good job?

308
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,150
Don't you know Aide Choi's personality? Wait. For an explosion in no time.

309
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,990
- You should have consulted with me first!<br>- See?

310
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,570
So I am apologizing to you right now because of that.

311
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,970
Would an apology solve this problem?

312
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,250
Don't you know what a huge mess you created just now?

313
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,540
I know. Wouldn't I know it?

314
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,580
If I don't know that, then I am a real psycho, a real jerk.

315
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,160
I know, but my situation was...

316
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,920
Here, Aide Choi. When you're angry, chocolate...

317
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,410
But who ate all of this?!

318
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,630
Really people, without telling me, seriously...

319
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,300
Please stop being angry now.

320
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,680
Okay.

321
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,360
I will stop being angry and ask you a different question.

322
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,620
This... comes from an informant, right?

323
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,040
- Yes.<br>- Who is it?

324
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,330
It has quieted down quickly.

325
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,240
Today's ending is boring. What a pity.

326
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,250
Why don't we all go back to work?

327
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,790
- You can't tell me? Does that make any sense?<br>- They are going at it again!

328
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,580
But I told you I promised that informant not to divulge the identity.

329
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,250
Not to other people, but you must at least tell me.

330
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,910
- Don't you trust me?<br>- I do!

331
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,330
I trust you so much. If not you, whom would I trust, huh?

332
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,500
But that is really... A promise is a promise.

333
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,470
Hurry and tell me. I have to know who the informant is

334
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,100
so that I can figure out if that is reliable information,

335
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,320
and if it's reliable, the reason behind the tip-off.

336
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,750
I'm really sorry.

337
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,270
Assemblyman!

338
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,430
I am really truly sorry, but a promise...

339
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,560
Why don't you just hit me instead? I'm okay, just hit me!

340
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,350
Slap me, I'm fine with it!

341
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,040
Do you want to give me an ass whooping? Do it, whoop me!

342
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:27,620
Assemblyman Park, Baek Do Hyeon held a press conference.

343
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,640
- The contents?<br>- Jin Sang Pil's statement was a total fabrication

344
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,660
and an epitome of mudslinging politics that abuses his parliamentary privilege.<br> (<i>i.e. cannot be sued for slander)</i>

345
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,500
Assemblyman Park, if it plays out like this,

346
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,890
our share of 40% is completely out of the question now.

347
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,160
Is it Secretary General Baek?

348
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,660
Ah, Baek—

349
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,120
Assemblyman Park, is Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's disclosure true?

350
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,210
Have you agreed to a faction share with Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon?

351
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,880
But reporters, Assemblyman Park is not running away or anything.

352
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,480
So calm down and sit down to drink some tea

353
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,170
and share some cookies as well...

354
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,300
Secretary General Baek officially denied it. What is the Anti-BH position?

355
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,910
Assemblyman Park, please answer.

356
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,950
This should be, in a calm manner...

357
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,930
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's claim is made up.

358
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:27,090
Without fail, I will ask him to bear responsibility for this fabrication.

359
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,290
<i>Joint Announcement of Baek Do Hyeon and Park Choon Seop: "Agreement about Gookmin Party Nominee Shares Is Fabrication!"</i>

360
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:55,090
- Yes.<br>- How does it feel to get beaten up by a partner who had been contractually terminated?

361
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,640
I should rather thank you for stopping the Anti-BH's share from getting bigger.

362
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,370
Is Assemblyman Park Choon Seop the kind of person who'd tolerate a loss?

363
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,390
Even though not much time remains in my term,

364
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,950
I will be able to watch you losing the election, while exchanging blows with the Anti-BH faction.

365
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,700
Good luck.

366
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,140
Secretary General Baek, what on earth happened here!

367
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,620
Explain yourself!

368
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,100
Are you stabbing us in the back so as to not to give us the written promise, or what!

369
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,620
- It was Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi.<br>- What?

370
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,310
- Hong Chan Mi?<br>- She holds a grudge because of yesterday's event and she tipped off Assemblyman Jin.

371
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,280
We don't have any interest in that sort of thing.

372
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,450
What I want is

373
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,940
Secretary General Baek's promise to carry out the agreement.

374
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,700
Yes, a written promise!

375
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,390
Before you write us that promise, I won't take even one step from here ever!

376
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,250
Aren't you two somehow mistaken about the priorities?

377
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,380
- What?<br>- Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil who has dishonored the party by spreading a false rumor

378
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,120
and Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi who fed him that false rumor!

379
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,890
I think taking appropriate measures against those two comes first.

380
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,200
Do you intend to drag this out again?

381
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,390
I'm just saying we should get rid of weeds first to harvest better fruit.

382
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,080
What do you think?

383
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,900
Exposé politics, obnoxious politics.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

384
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,370
Out, Jin Sang Pil!

385
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,910
Out, Jin Sang Pil!

386
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,330
I, Park Choon Seop, during the last 30 years

387
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,280
of my political career, acted with rationality,

388
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,120
and I'm proud to say that I've always kept my dignity and stayed only on the right path.

389
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,940
However, because of Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's irresponsible exposé,

390
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,140
the pride and honor that I have built through all these years

391
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,350
collapsed completely.

392
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,890
All this time, our party

393
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,120
has done its part with patience and efforts at persuasion

394
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,180
in dealing with Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's perpetuation of exposé politics.

395
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,920
But we can't approve it anymore.

396
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,780
We have decided to file a complaint against Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil to our party's ethics committee.

397
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,280
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil shall, before the Ethics Committee hearing,

398
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:56,950
prove to the party and citizens that what he exposed today was not false information.

399
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,050
If he ignores our demand,

400
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:06,250
the Ethics Committee shall remove his name and expel him from the party.

401
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,610
Exposé politics, obnoxious politics. Out, Jin Sang Pil!

402
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:21,550
Out, Jin Sang Pil! Out, Jin Sang Pil!

403
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,740
To avoid being removed from the party,

404
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,170
you have to prove the credibility of your claim.

405
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,950
You'll have to tell us who the informant was in the end.

406
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,100
That's right. Stop being stubborn.

407
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,000
You'll get kicked out at this rate.

408
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,520
If they want to kick me out, let them.

409
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,130
Assemblyman.

410
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,280
Assemblyman.

411
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,480
The Ethics Committee disciplinary hearing has been scheduled.

412
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,240
What discipline?

413
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,540
<i>Notice of the Party's Ethics Committee Hearing.<br>Expulsion of Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil</i>

414
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,750
Wow. These people

415
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,750
Wow. These people are surely moving fast.

416
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,670
Are you still not going to tell us who the informant is?

417
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,480
I can't help it.

418
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,940
Do you know what it means

419
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,560
to be expelled from the party?

420
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,500
It means the Indifferent-to-BH faction that has been gaining much support from the citizens will cease to exist.

421
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,600
I still can't help it.

422
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,090
The informant definitely belongs to Gookmin Party.

423
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,750
From this point on, log onto the websites of every single assemblyman as well as the party,

424
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,430
and find out if anyone used the same format as this one

425
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,430
- for a press conference statement.<br>- Yes.

426
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,950
Even if the format's different, if the statements have similar text or expressions, print them out

427
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,720
and bring them to me.

428
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,340
- Understood?<br>- Yes.

429
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:20,480
To stop Assemblyman from being expelled from the party, we must find the informant.

430
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,260
Yes.

431
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,480
Assemblyman Jin, you must keep your promise.

432
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,620
Why aren't you answering?

433
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,460
You promised you would never tell people that I was the one who gave you the tip.

434
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,670
It's just that you asked about the obvious.

435
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,140
Don't worry. Bye.

436
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,300
Assemblyman Jin. Assemblyman!

437
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,780
Who was that?

438
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,470
It's nothing.

439
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,910
What is it?

440
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,590
<i>A notice from the Ethics Committee was transmitted.</i>

441
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,780
Ethics Committee?

442
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,360
What is it?

443
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,400
<i>List of Members of the Committee: Hong Chan Mi, Kang Sang Ho...</i>

444
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,580
Whose idea was it to put me on the disciplinary committee

445
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,240
to judge Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil?

446
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,190
I'm not sure. Why don't you ask the Ethics Committee?

447
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,150
I asked who!

448
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,390
It's Park Choon Seop.

449
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,840
Why did you include me in the disciplinary committee?

450
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,400
Obviously, because what you did was despicable.

451
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,130
Aren't you being too hasty to decide it was me?

452
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,070
If it ever turns out

453
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:14,030
that you were Assemblyman Jin's informant,

454
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:21,000
Secretary General and I will issue a joint statement

455
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,700
I'm listening.

456
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,140
Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi, who lost the election for the chairman of the member council,

457
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,710
became upset at Secretary General for not helping her,

458
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,790
and was denied after attempting to join the Anti-BH faction.

459
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:45,090
She then began to bear a grudge, and in order to create conflict between the two factions,

460
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:51,080
on the condition that he wouldn't reveal the informant,

461
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,120
she supplied Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil with false information.

462
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,100
Do you think I'll just let you do that and do nothing?

463
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,570
I'm an attorney.

464
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,010
Look, Assemblywoman Hong.

465
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,890
The place we live in is not a law court but Yeouido.

466
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,660
Turning a Spokeswoman who gained popularity with her looks alone into an idiot

467
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,480
is a piece of cake here.

468
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,640
Hello.

469
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,560
Assemblyman Park's green tea's quite aromatic.

470
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,390
It truly is.

471
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:52,210
Attend the disciplinary hearing and demand Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's expulsion from the party.

472
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,870
Why do I have to do that?

473
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:59,870
If Jin Sang Pil says your name aloud, isn't it better for you to deny it right then?

474
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,930
It would be extremely troublesome for you if things get out of hand and you're not there.

475
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,040
Assemblyman Jin will never disclose the informant.

476
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,580
Don't forget. Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil must be expelled.

477
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,360
Look, Assemblywoman Hong.

478
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,180
Will Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil

479
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,430
disclose the informant or not?

480
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,350
He won't.

481
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,710
Although he's incompetent, he's a man of principle.

482
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,470
It might seem people are different,

483
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,450
but if you look inside, they're all the same.

484
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,100
If you like something, others like it too, and if you hate something, others hate it too.

485
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,380
If you think you might tell on someone, others will do the same.

486
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,530
Aide Choi.

487
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:04,010
We looked everywhere but can't find anything similar to this.

488
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,570
- Secretary Sim.<br>- Yes.

489
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,240
Did you check everything from the Spokeswoman's office and Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi's office?

490
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,520
Yes, I compared them all.

491
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,920
Why Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi all of a sudden?

492
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,130
No matter how much I think about it, Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi is the informant.

493
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,670
To have access to such classified information, the person must be one of the assemblymen.

494
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,450
Because Assemblywoman Hong had a falling out with Secretary General Baek, that gives her motivation too.

495
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,110
What's up with him?

496
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,690
Aide.

497
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,880
- About Assemblywoman Hong.<br>- Yes.

498
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,380
I just received an electronic notice.

499
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,660
She's one of the disciplinary committee members for our Assemblyman.

500
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,360
Disciplinary committee member?

501
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,500
Then it's not her.

502
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:02,590
Unless she's gone crazy, would she strike him with disciplinary action when she was the one feeding him information?

503
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:10,470
<i>Attend the disciplinary hearing and demand Assemblyman Jin's removal.</i>

504
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
What are you doing?

505
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,100
I'm here because I have something to say.

506
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,650
<i>If it's Choi In Kyung, then maybe.</i>

507
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,590
<i>That word "comrade" does not fit you, Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

508
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,280
I have nothing to hear from you.

509
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,320
Would you vote

510
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,740
against expelling my Assemblyman?

511
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,480
What did you say?

512
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,880
Disciplinary committee member.

513
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,390
You probably became one by Secretary General Baek's order.

514
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,150
But instead of Secretary General Baek who has hit rock bottom,

515
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,910
I'm asking you to choose my Assemblyman.

516
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,740
You seem to be relapsing into the symptom of not knowing your place again.

517
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,610
Do I look like a person who will work with someone like Assemblyman Jin?

518
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,330
About 6 years ago,

519
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,580
at a gathering of attorneys who loved the environment,

520
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,180
when you were demonstrating for amending the environmental acts,

521
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,410
I accompanied Secretary General Baek there.

522
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,420
What?

523
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,020
At the place where the demonstration took place,

524
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,900
there was a young lawyer who wrote something on the big poster.

525
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:49,590
Even though she had magic marker pen marks all over her hands and face,

526
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:55,980
she asked to shake our hands without hesitation.

527
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,250
She was brave and passionate.

528
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,020
What are you talking about right now?

529
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,950
I am telling you that you were like that in the old times.

530
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,900
So?

531
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,400
You want to tell me I have changed, huh?

532
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,990
"After a promising person got the gold badge,

533
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,060
she became trash." That's what you want to ridicule me about.

534
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,020
Assemblywoman, you have not changed nor became trash. But...

535
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,360
What about <i>But</i>?

536
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,060
Like many of the proportional assemblymen,

537
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,520
I think you are weighed down by the badge worn suddenly

538
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,600
without much preparation.

539
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,840
Ally yourself with our Assemblyman.

540
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:53,050
Our Assemblyman is the person who can bear the weight with you.

541
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,800
Get out.

542
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,630
- Assemblywoman.<br> - Didn't you hear? Get out!

543
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,450
Still, I...

544
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,680
did my best. Do you know that?

545
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,200
If anybody among the proportional assemblymen worked harder than I did on Assembly activities, ask him to step forward.

546
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,610
I admit that you worked hard on Assembly activities.

547
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,810
But as a proportional assemblywoman,

548
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,790
whom you represented, indeed --

549
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,200
- can you say that with confidence? <br> - What?

550
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,830
Please check with whom you ate lunch and dinner for the last four years.

551
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:53,100
It shows there whom you represented.

552
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,290
This bravado...

553
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,170
In Kyung, what are you going to do if you started a fire?

554
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,270
Aide Choi.

555
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,950
What?

556
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,740
I found...

557
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,470
What?

558
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,970
The informer.

559
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,330
The informer has to be this person.

560
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,960
Your reasoning?

561
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,480
There was a fact that went unnoticed.

562
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,770
Madam Hong is the incarnate fiend of ad lib.

563
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,420
-Ad lib? <br>- Yes.

564
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,840
Hence, from the statements on the home page

565
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,280
we couldn't figure out who was the informer.

566
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,470
Because those statements were written by the aides.

567
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,430
Right? Look at this.

568
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,340
<i>The people watch us.</i>

569
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,530
Here.

570
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,400
The Assemblyman's statement written by the informer herself.

571
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,640
<i>Wake up! The people are watching!</i>

572
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,610
<i>The people are watching.</i>

573
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,610
<i> The people are watching.</i>

574
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,360
She is properly caught. M.a.d.a.m. Hong.

575
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,780
Did I do well?

576
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,810
Yeah.

577
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,860
Praise me.

578
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,840
That was praise, wasn't it?

579
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:20,080
<i>Do you understand the meaning of getting expelled?</i>

580
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,860
<i>It means Indifferent-to-BH, who received a lot of support from the public, will disappear.</i>

581
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:35,510
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

582
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,800
Aide Choi.

583
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,670
Assemblywoman Hong, who gave the information to you,

584
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,380
became a member of the very disciplinary committee that will discipline you.

585
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,040
Tell the press now. Even though Hong Chan Mi will deny it.

586
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,610
First, break the news.

587
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,580
- It's okay.<br>- Pardon?

588
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,890
In order not to get expelled from the party,

589
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,210
revealing the informer seems so low.

590
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,160
Assemblyman.

591
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,320
Assemblywoman is going to expel you from the party right now.

592
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,390
Is it a big deal that you don't look low in this situation?

593
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,150
Go home now.

594
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,410
If you are not able to do it, I will.

595
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,400
Aide Choi. Wait for a moment. Wait.

596
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,200
It is no use even if you stop me.

597
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,030
I can't watch Indifferent-to-BH to disappear like this. If Indifferent-to-BH disappears,

598
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:52,220
my goal, that I will get you re-elected, will vanish.

599
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,640
Aide Choi.

600
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,530
I, too, do this to save Indifferent-to-BH.

601
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:03,370
What are you saying?

602
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,520
You said I can't act by myself for Indifferent-to-BH.

603
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,780
Then, you are doing this because of recruiting Assemblywoman Hong?

604
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:16,090
Assemblywoman Hong asked me what I can do for her if she joins Indifferent-to-BH.

605
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,660
Nomination? I can't offer it to her.

606
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,130
Political funds, a party position, or an Assembly position...

607
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:28,500
I can't get her any of them. But, when I thought about it,

608
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,120
there is one thing I can do for her.

609
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,820
What is that?

610
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,990
Keeping the promise. Not betraying her.

611
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,810
I can be trustworthy to the person who always deceives or is deceived.

612
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,420
Assemblywoman Hong

613
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,200
almost lost her reason.

614
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,260
Do you think she would know your intention?

615
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,910
Whether she knows or not, if I am a leader of Indifferent-to-BH, I have to act this way.

616
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:02,940
-Assemblyman. <br> -That's why you just pretend not to know it.

617
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,900
I beg of you.

618
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,400
<i>Gookmin Party</i>

619
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,790
<i>2015 3rd Ethics Committee</i>

620
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:22,940
<i>Agenda: Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's Disciplinary Punishment of Expulsion from the Assembly and the Party</i>

621
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,490
Ahh, really crazy.

622
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,590
Because Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil circulated the fabricated false information,

623
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,790
the image of the party has fallen to the ground, right now.

624
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,540
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, do you admit your conduct is subject to discipline?

625
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,610
No, I don't admit it.

626
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,620
I told the truth. How is it that conduct subject to discipline?

627
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,700
Playing pat-a-cake with the shares of nominees between the Pro-BH and Anti-BH factions

628
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,100
is the conduct for which discipline should be applied.

629
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,550
Are you saying pat-a-cake? Give proof we played pat-a-cake!

630
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:58,810
Huh? From whom on earth did you receive this information?

631
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,500
-What are you doing without answering?<br>- Confess quickly who that person was.

632
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,420
I can't answer.

633
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,670
What does it matter who the informer was?

634
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:11,060
I made a promise to the source to keep it secret.

635
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,550
Do you know you will be expelled from the party? Do you still want not to tell?

636
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,480
No. I will not.

637
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:21,260
Assemblyman Jin, don't make it too complicated.

638
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,650
How about resigning on your own?

639
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:27,540
You don't love our Gookmin Party much, do you?

640
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,680
Yes. I love it very much.

641
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,940
Sometimes, it looks like Balsam Institute; I feel right at home. <br><i> (A school in comedy show Gag Concert ).</i>

642
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,210
Its environment is so pleasant that even a migratory bird flies in.

643
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,420
Assemblyman, your speaking is subject to discipline.

644
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,260
Assemblyman Jin, what is your true color?

645
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,010
What do you mean what? He is a leftist.

646
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,630
I am an onion (Yang Pa) that belongs to leftist (Joi Pa) and to rightist (Wu Pa). The more you peel it, newer ones show up.

647
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,310
Stop playing on words. Where is that kind of ideology in the world?

648
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,410
Yes.

649
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:58,230
If you want to hear my ideology, I am...

650
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,960
only a human. A human.

651
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,640
Assemblyman Kang!

652
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,990
A human, like truly being a human:

653
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,090
to believe one another;

654
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,090
to get along well;

655
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,070
not to stab someone else's back, please;

656
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:25,680
not to fight each other; not to make someone cry;

657
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,840
to join hands,

658
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,940
and to walk together...

659
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,500
that's my political idea.

660
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,050
<i>Humanism</i>

661
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:04,090
Aide Choi who had worked in BH sent a text to me just now.

662
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,210
That it is called <i> Humanism.</i>

663
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,830
Will this be the answer to your question?

664
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,530
Excuse us during the meeting.

665
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:25,090
I came to watch here as a representative of the assemblymen who filed a complaint.

666
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,740
This Committee thinks that we have to take the action of

667
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,720
Assemblyman Jin's expulsion from the party right away.

668
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,760
-I agree.<br>- I agree.

669
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,880
Assemblyman Jin has to be expelled from the party.

670
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,380
<i>Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi Schedule</i>

671
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,070
<i>Please check with whom you ate lunch and dinner for the last four years.</i>

672
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,900
<i>It shows there whom you represented.</i>

673
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:15,230
Assemblywoman Hong, what have you been looking at continuously?

674
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,730
State your opinion of the disciplinary punishment quickly.

675
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:24,770
<i>If I have to put it into words, probably a partner.</i>

676
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:30,470
<i>Who can always be contractually terminated if she fails to meet the profit goals.</i>

677
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:39,270
<i>The place we live in is not a law court but Yeouido.</i>

678
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:44,890
<i>Turning a spokeswoman who gained popularity with her looks alone into an idiot</i>

679
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,800
<i> is a piece of cake here.</i>

680
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,540
Assemblywoman Hong?

681
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,460
I will tell my opinion of the disciplinary punishment.

682
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,380
I want to take the action of expulsion.

683
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,400
But the target of the action is not Assemblyman Jin.

684
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,870
It must be to me, Assemblywoman Hong, who told the truth to him.

685
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,850
Assemblywoman Hong? Assemblywoman Hong!

686
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:39,070
Assemblyman Jin only trusted the informer.

687
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:43,540
He had no intention to drive the party into a difficult position by circulating false information.

688
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:50,480
Therefore, there is no cause for discipline in Assemblyman Jin's action.

689
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,490
If you want to bring disciplinary action against me,

690
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,230
please form a Disciplinary Committee at your convenience.

691
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:08,330
Whether the information I supplied is true or not,

692
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:14,100
let's call that into question there, again, Secretary General Baek.

693
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,180
Assemblyman Park,

694
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,640
well... shall we proceed properly?

695
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:39,810
Avatar of Anti-BH, will you announce the result of today's meeting?

696
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,540
From this moment

697
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:51,000
I resign from the position of Spokesperson of the Gookmin Party.

698
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,090
<i> Oh, No... Assemblywoman Hong...</i>

699
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,000
<i>Assemblywoman Hong!</i>

700
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
<i>Please. Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

701
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,240
Assemblywoman Hong.

702
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,730
You are...

703
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:15,470
a fool.

704
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,510
Hello.

705
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,630
Assemblyman Jin!

706
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,860
I know. I know. So creepy!

707
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,980
It's okay. Okay.

708
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,830
Well done, Assemblyman.

709
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,380
I am sorry. I always make you edgy.

710
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,120
I will consider it as my fate from now on.

711
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,380
Meet Assemblywoman Hong soon.

712
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,250
Ah...Really. Where is Assemblywoman Hong?

713
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,970
How...

714
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,000
on earth...

715
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,540
Why on earth...

716
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:00,300
Long time no see. Have you been well?

717
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,190
You are studying well?

718
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,520
Yes. Aide Choi, you've been well, right?

719
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,300
Don't even mention it. You don't know how hard I have to work to raise a kid who is not supposed to be my fate.

720
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,520
I saw the news. He was almost expelled from the party.

721
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,220
He had a close call.

722
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,180
Assemblyman might have saved the country in his previous life.

723
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,900
It's because you are by his side.

724
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,140
When you two team up, no one can match you.

725
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:27,400
By the way, how is the bill you were making going?

726
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,210
I stopped making it. It looks like I don't yet have the ability to make it.

727
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,050
Try to send it to me although it's not finished. I will check it for you.

728
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:38,650
That's okay. If you read it, it will only hurt your eyes.

729
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,720
Next time, just call me with your cellphone.

730
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,150
I won't tell Assemblyman. What is this, like a criminal?

731
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,650
Yes.

732
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,770
Anyhow, Aide Choi, cheer up.

733
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:51,980
Okay. Thank you.

734
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:07,880
Aide Choi.

735
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,820
What are you doing?

736
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:14,020
It seems Assemblywoman Hong hasn't come to work today either.

737
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,360
Did you think she would come to work in the middle of a rumor about her resignation from the Assembly?

738
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,600
She doesn't answer the phone.

739
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,830
Will she really resign?

740
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,830
-Hello?<br>-<i>Kim Gyu Hwan?</i>

741
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,410
Yes. Who is calling?

742
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:39,420
<i>I am Section Chief Kim Sang Jin from Central Branch Prosecutor's Office.</i>

743
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,810
Central Branch Prosecutor's Office?

744
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,850
What is the question you want to ask?

745
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,550
Yes.

746
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,510
There is a case that we are investigating secretly.

747
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,680
Secret investigation?

748
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,360
Do you know Hanmin Bank?

749
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,770
Hanmin Bank?

750
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:13,970
You received a shopping bag where there was money from the secretary of the bank president.

751
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,110
And you delivered it to Assemblyman Jin, didn't you?

752
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,380
<i>If...I mean if...</i>

753
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:35,220
<i>If you have not received the money back from Assemblyman Jin,</i>

754
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:40,590
<i> there seems no chance to hand over to the prosecutor your loan irregularities we discovered.</i>

755
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,480
<i>6th day of the Parliamentary Inspection</i>

756
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:05,010
<i> Of course, Bank President, you will get a punishment, but</i>

757
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:11,530
<i>compared to the punishment for the illegal loan of $140 million, it will be a mere smidgen.</i>

758
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,750
Bank President.

759
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:19,890
Have you received the money back from Assemblyman Jin?

760
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,200
Tell me.

761
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,480
Did you deliver the money to Assemblyman Jin or not?

762
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,730
<i>Of course not.</i>

763
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:33,540
<i>I have not received it back.</i>

764
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,100
<i>Yes. You haven't so.</i>

765
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,390
<i>I understand well.</i>

766
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,300
<i>Secretary General.</i>

767
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,450
<i>Assemblyman Jin, he is in no exit situation now.</i>

768
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:05,580
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki </i>

769
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:13,570
<i> This inspection is the first and last parliamentary inspection for you.</i>

770
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,980
<i>I will beat you even because of Hyung Dal Soo.</i>

771
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,230
<i>Did you deliver the money to Assemblyman Jin or not?</i>

772
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,220
<i>I want to see you now.</i>

773
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,200
<i>What did you do with the designer watch you received from President Lee Taek Jo?</i>

774
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,560
<i>Kim Gyu Hwan said he delivered the money to Assemblyman Jin.</i>

775
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,440
<i> In this case, Secretary General Baek must be behind it.</i>

776
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,660
<i>People don't believe me.</i>

777
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,490
<i>We can have the motion for the arrest rejected.</i>

778
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:41,510
<i>I will appear in the prosecutor's office.</i>
