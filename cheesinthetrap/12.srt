1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,630
<font color="yellow">Over here.</font>

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,250
<font color="yellow">Here, coffee. You drink coffee, right?</font>

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,140
<font color="yellow">What's with you today?</font>

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,640
<font color="yellow">First you buy me that crappy meal.
Now this coffee.</font>

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,250
<font color="yellow">The food in the cafeteria is really good.</font>

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,830
<font color="yellow">Forget it. What do you want?</font>

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,880
<font color="yellow">You have something to say,
don't you?</font>

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,840
<font color="yellow">Do you want to attend a piano concours?</font>

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,940
<font color="yellow">I think this would be perfect for you.</font>

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,130
<font color="yellow"><i>I think In Ho has really tamped down
his temperament lately.</i></font>

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,020
<font color="yellow">I can see the unique colors of his
that you spoke of...</font>

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,360
<font color="yellow">I see them shining through.</font>

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's good.</font>

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,350
<font color="yellow">I would like to do something for him
at this point in time.</font>

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,670
<font color="yellow">At a time like this,
it would be good to have an actual goal.</font>

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,580
<font color="yellow">Then what about a competition?</font>

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,510
<font color="yellow">Ah, that sounds good.</font>

18
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,460
<font color="yellow">Next month, there is
a national piano concours.</font>

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,990
<font color="yellow">With In Ho's skills and one month...</font>

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,640
<font color="yellow">I think we could do it if we work hard.</font>

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,140
<font color="yellow">I think a small concours would be better
than a big one right now.</font>

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,810
<font color="yellow">With a personality like that,
would he do a small one?</font>

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,060
<font color="yellow">What is it? You don't want to?</font>

24
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,760
<font color="yellow">I want you to know that your tastes
are quite old-fashioned.</font>

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,090
<font color="yellow">Old-fashioned?</font>

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,080
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down on it
for being a small event?</font>

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,990
<font color="yellow">A bit.</font>

28
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,430
<font color="yellow">Are you doing it or not?</font>

29
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,710
<font color="yellow">I have to, of course.</font>

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,550
<font color="yellow">I'm even thankful for this right now.</font>

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,500
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd say that.</font>

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,600
<font color="yellow">I can really do this, right?</font>

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,410
<font color="yellow">Of course! Just work hard.</font>

34
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,140
<font color="yellow">Concours...</font>

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,000
<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 12]</i></font>

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,590
<font color="yellow">This guy keeps posting pictures.</font>

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,380
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, I'm positive that this is
Yonyi University.</i></font>

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,690
<font color="yellow"><i>This guy keeps getting worse and worse.</i></font>

39
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,510
<font color="yellow">- Who is this nosy person?
- <i>This is fun. Don't stop him.</i></font>

40
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Isn't it a matter of time
before we find out who it is?</i></font>

41
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,240
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you all please.</font>

42
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,140
<font color="yellow">Once I catch who it is and report him...</font>

43
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,150
<font color="yellow">But if they ask me
if I really stalked her...</font>

44
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,850
<font color="yellow">Will they contact Hong Seol too?</font>

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,590
<font color="yellow"><i>Is he filming me right now?</i></font>

46
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,840
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

47
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,260
<font color="yellow"><i>That wild boar.
Why doesn't he just look for food?</i></font>

48
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,140
<font color="yellow">- <i>Why is he so nosy?</i>
- What are you doing there?</font>

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,580
<font color="yellow">All right, all right.</font>

50
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,230
<font color="yellow">I have to stop this before rumors start.</font>

51
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,850
<font color="yellow"><i>This caller is unavailable...</i></font>

52
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,970
<font color="yellow">He won't pick up.</font>

53
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,010
<font color="yellow">I should have just told him quickly.</font>

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,070
<font color="yellow">I only didn't because
we hadn't been talking for a while.</font>

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,540
<font color="yellow">We just made up and we're fighting again.</font>

56
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,650
<font color="yellow">That expression he had before wasn't
simply because he was a little mad.</font>

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,990
<font color="yellow">Show yourself.</font>

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,100
<font color="yellow">If you don't come out,
I'm going to report you to the police.</font>

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
<font color="yellow">You could just run now.</font>

60
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,140
<font color="yellow">Seol...</font>

61
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,170
<font color="yellow">Don't come any closer
and talk from there.</font>

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,610
<font color="yellow">Seol, I was wrong.</font>

63
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,110
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this? Are you crazy?</font>

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,290
<font color="yellow">I was wrong about everything, including
bothering you all you this time.</font>

65
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,560
<font color="yellow">I won't harass you ever again.</font>

66
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,030
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me just this once.
Would you?</font>

67
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,780
<font color="yellow">I'll even sign a contract
promising not to see you.</font>

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,320
<font color="yellow">So tell that thug friend of yours
to give it a rest, okay?</font>

69
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,060
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

70
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,860
<font color="yellow">That guy put up photos of me on the
internet calling me a stalker.</font>

71
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,470
<font color="yellow">It's that thug, right?</font>

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,480
<font color="yellow">Stop him for me.</font>

73
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,900
<font color="yellow">If you do that,
I will stay quiet and not report him.</font>

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,830
<font color="yellow">You made such a big fuss
ever since last year.</font>

75
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,150
<font color="yellow">Now you even show up in my neighborhood?</font>

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,300
<font color="yellow">Are you sane?</font>

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,810
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

78
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,340
<font color="yellow">You ignored my sincerity
and were cruel with my feelings.</font>

79
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,520
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm here today.</font>

80
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,570
<font color="yellow">So it's all my fault?</font>

81
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,250
<font color="yellow">Have you ever actually considered me?</font>

82
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,930
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

83
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,290
<font color="yellow">find it really frustrating
that I like someone like you.</font>

84
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,990
<font color="yellow">Whenever you see rich and handsome guys
like Yoo Jung, you go nuts.</font>

85
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,580
<font color="yellow">Pull yourself together.</font>

86
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,520
<font color="yellow">You're always bringing up Senior.</font>

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,230
<font color="yellow">To me, you can't even compare to
someone like Senior.</font>

88
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,620
<font color="yellow">Not in any respect.</font>

89
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,720
<font color="yellow">What's so great about Yoo Jung?</font>

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,610
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung is the one who started
all of this.</font>

91
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,400
<font color="yellow">He pretends to be nice and makes me
the bad one in front of others.</font>

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,690
<font color="yellow">Because of him,
I became a outsider at school.</font>

93
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,670
<font color="yellow">You know clearly that he was the one who
convinced me that you liked me.</font>

94
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,580
<font color="yellow">Then he goes behind my back
and starts dating you?</font>

95
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,230
<font color="yellow">He's the one who really has done wrong.</font>

96
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,030
<font color="yellow">It was him who deceived me and did
everything that was truly strange!</font>

97
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,830
<font color="yellow">Why is it me
who gets treated like garbage?</font>

98
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,140
<font color="yellow">Why? Why, why, why!</font>

99
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,220
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

100
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,910
<font color="yellow">You wanted to get revenge on him?</font>

101
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,910
<font color="yellow">You were only using me to get revenge
on Senior.</font>

102
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,020
<font color="yellow">You didn't like me.</font>

103
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,080
<font color="yellow">What do you know to show off like that?</font>

104
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,210
<font color="yellow">Wow, really...</font>

105
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,590
<font color="yellow">You really don't get it.</font>

106
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,130
<font color="yellow">Hey, should I really scare you?</font>

107
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,140
<font color="yellow">Should I make you shake in fear
every time you go home?</font>

108
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,130
<font color="yellow">Should I make it so you can't go to
school anymore?</font>

109
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,400
<font color="yellow">Should I grab your hair in front of
your restaurant to knock sense into you?</font>

110
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,200
<font color="yellow">If you don't want that, shut up and
tell that thug to delete those posts.</font>

111
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,120
<font color="yellow">Or else I'll kill you and him.</font>

112
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,350
<font color="yellow">Baek In Ho has nothing to do with it.</font>

113
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

114
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,250
<font color="yellow">Because I did it.</font>

115
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Seol, do you really think this is okay?</i></font>

116
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's not put it up. I'm scared.</i></font>

117
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,550
<font color="yellow"><i>It'll be fine.</i></font>

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,880
<font color="yellow"><i>It's better if I put it up.</i></font>

119
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't hold back anymore.</i></font>

120
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,640
<font color="yellow"><i>Young Gon is a stalker.</i></font>

121
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,510
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, I'm watching everything.</i></font>

122
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,760
<font color="yellow"><i>So why don't you stop at this point?</i></font>

123
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,370
<font color="yellow">So, you...</font>

124
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,940
<font color="yellow">You were the one playing me?</font>

125
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,170
<font color="yellow">I warned you to stop.</font>

126
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,660
<font color="yellow">You were the one who didn't listen.</font>

127
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,290
<font color="yellow">Ah, you're right.</font>

128
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,590
<font color="yellow">Your face was blurred out
in every single photo.</font>

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,970
<font color="yellow">You're dead!</font>

130
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,620
<font color="yellow">Ow! Hey!</font>

131
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,380
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop! My eyes! Stop right there!</font>

132
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,760
<font color="yellow">Mission complete.</font>

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,500
<font color="yellow"><i>That loser followed your girlfriend
home today.</i></font>

134
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,950
<font color="yellow"><i>I filmed it all.</i></font>

135
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,590
<font color="yellow"><i>You're going to say I did a good job.</i></font>

136
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,010
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, should I really scare you?</i></font>

137
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,960
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I make you shake in fear
every time you go home?</i></font>

138
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I make it so you can't go to
school anymore?</i></font>

139
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,200
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I grab your hair in front of
your restaurant to knock sense into you?</i></font>

140
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,740
<font color="yellow"><i>You've kept everything you filmed safe,
haven't you?</i></font>

141
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Send everything to me.</i></font>

142
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,730
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Eun Taek?</font>

143
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,360
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

144
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,440
<font color="yellow">Hong Seol, stop!</font>

145
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,350
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop!</font>

146
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,460
<font color="yellow">Dad, Dad!</font>

147
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,730
<font color="yellow">My eyes!</font>

148
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,800
<font color="yellow">- Dad.
- Who are you, punk?</font>

149
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,870
<font color="yellow">No one, I'm just Seol's friend.</font>

150
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,190
<font color="yellow">Hi, Seol. Goodbye.</font>

151
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,310
<font color="yellow">Stop right there. I said stop, you punk!</font>

152
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,280
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you if I catch you.</font>

153
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,600
<font color="yellow">- Dad, Dad!
- Stop!</font>

154
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,870
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

155
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,330
<font color="yellow">Hey, who is that kid? What's with him?</font>

156
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,540
<font color="yellow">Dad, are you okay?</font>

157
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
<font color="yellow">I'm okay? Are you okay?</font>

158
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,440
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- Are you hurt anywhere?</font>

159
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,210
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Dad, shoes...</font>

160
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,590
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I am.</font>

161
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh Young Gon went crazy
and even came to my neighborhood.</i></font>

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,850
<font color="yellow">He must be truly crazy.</font>

163
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,910
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

164
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,330
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you okay, Seol?</i></font>

165
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,410
<font color="yellow"><i>I ended up recording it</i></font>

166
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,510
<font color="yellow"><i>so if I show this file and the pictures,
he won't be able to do anything.</i></font>

167
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,920
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

168
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,040
<font color="yellow"><i>You are finally free.</i></font>

169
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,670
<font color="yellow"><i>It could become a problem
that I put up those posts.</i></font>

170
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Now we'll both go down together.</i></font>

171
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Anyway, I have all the evidence,
so it's done.</i></font>

172
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,790
<font color="yellow">Young Gon is the one who started
stalking and writing posts first.</font>

173
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,210
<font color="yellow">He did it all first.</font>

174
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,270
<font color="yellow">Yeah, he bothered you so much.</font>

175
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,940
<font color="yellow">It will be okay, Seol.</font>

176
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,910
<font color="yellow">Heart.</font>

177
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,050
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it will.</font>

178
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,700
<font color="yellow">What about Senior...</font>

179
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,270
<font color="yellow">Well, he won't pick up even if I call.</font>

180
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,560
<font color="yellow">Young Gon is here.</font>

181
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're all here.</font>

182
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,340
<font color="yellow">Hi, hi, hi, hi.</font>

183
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,140
<font color="yellow">This worked out well.</font>

184
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,360
<font color="yellow">You're all going to eat, right?
What should we eat?</font>

185
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,970
<font color="yellow">It's my treat.</font>

186
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,770
<font color="yellow">Meat... how about meat?</font>

187
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,310
<font color="yellow">- Meat?
- Yeah.</font>

188
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,360
<font color="yellow">I don't want it.</font>

189
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,270
<font color="yellow">Come on, Senior!</font>

190
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,030
<font color="yellow">You're going to come, right?
You know I love you, Senior.</font>

191
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, how about we go for neck meat?</font>

192
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,340
<font color="yellow">It's just too rough.</font>

193
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,990
<font color="yellow">Then how about marbled beef?</font>

194
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,960
<font color="yellow">They always give you too little.</font>

195
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,510
<font color="yellow">Ribs... how about ribs?</font>

196
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,780
<font color="yellow">- Ribs?
- Yes.</font>

197
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,210
<font color="yellow">My lovable junior, Young Gon!</font>

198
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,620
<font color="yellow">My lovable senior, Sang Chul!</font>

199
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,710
<font color="yellow">Sang Chul? You dropping honorifics?</font>

200
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,920
<font color="yellow">Hey, whatever! Let's get going.</font>

201
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,560
<font color="yellow">Young Gon is buying meat.
Do Hyun, let's go.</font>

202
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,700
<font color="yellow">- I guess I can go.
- Let's go!</font>

203
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,230
<font color="yellow">- Ribs, ribs, ribs!
- Ribs, ribs!</font>

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,420
<font color="yellow">Ribs!</font>

205
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,710
<font color="yellow">This is so tiring.</font>

206
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,520
<font color="yellow">Oh Young Gon is so annoying.</font>

207
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,880
<font color="yellow">Kim Sang Chul is even worse.</font>

208
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,060
<font color="yellow">He goes crazy over meat.</font>

209
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,430
<font color="yellow">He sure has a lot of money.</font>

210
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,500
<font color="yellow">The one who buys and the ones who
follow are on the same low level.</font>

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,800
<font color="yellow">It's not like they're in grade school.
Why do they all follow just to get meat?</font>

212
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,260
<font color="yellow">He knows he can't win over girls,
so he's trying to get the guys.</font>

213
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,410
<font color="yellow">Why are guys so simple-minded?</font>

214
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,800
<font color="yellow">Just ignore him.</font>

215
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,040
<font color="yellow">Everything is over for him,
but he doesn't know it.</font>

216
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
<font color="yellow">Quite pathetic.</font>

217
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,510
<font color="yellow">Eat up, everyone! Eat up!</font>

218
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,170
<font color="yellow">Eat the meat and the vegetables too.
The vegetables are good for you.</font>

219
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,870
<font color="yellow">- I'm only going to eat meat.
- Really?</font>

220
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,570
<font color="yellow">As always, spend your money
and they will all come running.</font>

221
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,060
<font color="yellow">Oh Young Gon, did you really cheat?</font>

222
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,790
<font color="yellow">You know that woman who slapped you?
She was not bad for a second.</font>

223
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,160
<font color="yellow">Pass her to me if you're not meeting her.</font>

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,370
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I was really curious too.</font>

225
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,400
<font color="yellow">I just happened to be missing that day.</font>

226
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,820
<font color="yellow">- Hey, tell us.
- Yeah!</font>

227
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,450
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

228
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,900
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I was cheating.</font>

229
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,160
<font color="yellow">Wow, really?</font>

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,740
<font color="yellow">Young Gon, I'm feeling
more and more close to you.</font>

231
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Senior.</font>

232
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,240
<font color="yellow">All the girls are saying crap about you,
but the guys are jealous of you.</font>

233
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,850
<font color="yellow">That woman who came to school
was really beautiful.</font>

234
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,030
<font color="yellow">I love bodies like that.</font>

235
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,640
<font color="yellow">I only dated her because she kept
following me around.</font>

236
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,210
<font color="yellow">And I know I became a really bad guy
last time.</font>

237
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,530
<font color="yellow">But actually, I was a victim too.</font>

238
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,110
<font color="yellow">She was cheating with Yoo Jung.</font>

239
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,300
<font color="yellow">Cheating? What about Seol?</font>

240
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,840
<font color="yellow">Well, he is a guy too.</font>

241
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,050
<font color="yellow">And to tell you the truth,
Yoo Jung's with Seol because of me.</font>

242
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,700
<font color="yellow">Because I said I wanted to date Seol,
he started to feel threatened...</font>

243
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,780
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you doing now?</i></font>

244
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,090
<font color="yellow"><i>There's something strange written about
you on the school site.</i></font>

245
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,370
<font color="yellow"><i>Take a look.</i></font>

246
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,620
<font color="yellow">Young Gon, there's a picture of you
on the school site.</font>

247
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,830
<font color="yellow">Ah, not my good-looking face again.</font>

248
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,460
<font color="yellow"><i>[THIS PERSON]</i>
Hey, hey. This isn't me.</font>

249
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,300
<font color="yellow">There's something about Do Hyun too.</font>

250
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,130
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- There's something written here.</font>

251
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,400
<font color="yellow">I don't look like this.</font>

252
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,290
<font color="yellow">Wait. What is this?</font>

253
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,480
<font color="yellow">"He's already in fourth year,
but is trash that still creeps on girls."</font>

254
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,300
<font color="yellow">- Senior, it wasn't me.
- Just hold on!</font>

255
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,580
<font color="yellow">"Worst of all, he only goes
after girls younger than him."</font>

256
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,480
<font color="yellow">"Last time, he tried flirting with
a younger girl"</font>

257
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,740
<font color="yellow">"and got dumped at the retreat."</font>

258
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,260
<font color="yellow">"At this point, he should be wearing
an electronic ankle monitor."</font>

259
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,870
<font color="yellow">Hey, did I ask for the intro?
You offered to introduce me to her!</font>

260
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,070
<font color="yellow">Did you say I got dumped?
I dumped her, you punk!</font>

261
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you dumped her.</font>

262
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,510
<font color="yellow">"With a good-looking face,
he goes around seducing men."</font>

263
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,510
<font color="yellow">Senior, is that what you think of me?</font>

264
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,570
<font color="yellow">No, let's drink.</font>

265
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,710
<font color="yellow">Sang Chul,
there's something about you too.</font>

266
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,890
<font color="yellow">- No...
- What could he say about me?</font>

267
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,250
<font color="yellow">That's right, Senior!
You don't need to look.</font>

268
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,780
<font color="yellow">Young Gon likes me a lot.</font>

269
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,870
<font color="yellow">- You can't see it.
- Wait, wait.</font>

270
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,490
<font color="yellow">- There is something.
- Where, where?</font>

271
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,900
<font color="yellow">"He's the most senior, but is always
poor and mooches off others."</font>

272
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,560
<font color="yellow">"He steals his junior's notebook
and always wants to eat meat."</font>

273
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,210
<font color="yellow">"He's almost 190 centimeters tall
with a tummy that sticks out."</font>

274
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,500
<font color="yellow">"He's a total bum."</font>

275
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,790
<font color="yellow">"I don't know how he got into our school.
I feel sorry for his parents."</font>

276
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,010
<font color="yellow">- You insult my parents, huh?
- Senior.</font>

277
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,180
<font color="yellow">I said it's not me.</font>

278
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,740
<font color="yellow">I even kept your stalker stuff to myself.</font>

279
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,940
<font color="yellow">- Hey, hey.
- Stop it.</font>

280
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,690
<font color="yellow">Wait. Hold still!</font>

281
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,420
<font color="yellow">Stay put.
He's a total stalker.</font>

282
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,160
<font color="yellow">His pictures are all over the internet.</font>

283
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,660
<font color="yellow">I saw him following girls
and taking their pictures.</font>

284
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,630
<font color="yellow">- You psychopath trash!
- Wow, you're psychotic.</font>

285
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,720
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

286
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,530
<font color="yellow">"Whenever Sang Chul calls for him,
he runs off like a servant."</font>

287
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,990
<font color="yellow">"He always wears fake luxury goods
and asks if it's obvious."</font>

288
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,790
<font color="yellow">"Poor idiot in class of 2009."</font>

289
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,590
<font color="yellow">Hey, there's one more.</font>

290
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,910
<font color="yellow">"They're all dirt poor,
and Yoo Jung buys them meals."</font>

291
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,260
<font color="yellow">"So they all gather around happily
like bums."</font>

292
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,800
<font color="yellow">"I bought them meals too
and, like bums, they gathered around me."</font>

293
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
<font color="yellow">"Why are there so many bums
in such a prestigious school?"</font>

294
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,070
<font color="yellow">What? Bums?</font>

295
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,910
<font color="yellow">"Honestly, these people should all be
taken out..."</font>

296
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,830
<font color="yellow">"and cleaned out."</font>

297
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,560
<font color="yellow">- Clean?
- Cleaned out?</font>

298
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,000
<font color="yellow">Wow, clean out the trash, huh?</font>

299
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,990
<font color="yellow">Say something!
Why don't you say something?</font>

300
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,980
<font color="yellow">Am I trash that needs to be cleaned up?</font>

301
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,540
<font color="yellow">- Hey, where are you going?
- Pay before you go!</font>

302
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,340
<font color="yellow">How did they find out?</font>

303
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

304
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,080
<font color="yellow">Hong Seol? Hong Seol, that wench.</font>

305
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,440
<font color="yellow">She took it down from that site
and then put it up on the school site?</font>

306
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill her.</font>

307
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,750
<font color="yellow"><i>I noticed you did something entertaining
to Seol yesterday.</i></font>

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,670
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

309
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,910
<font color="yellow">How did she find out?</font>

310
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,710
<font color="yellow">Pick up. Please, pick up.</font>

311
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,490
<font color="yellow">- <i>This caller is currently not...</i>
- Just pick up!</font>

312
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,460
<font color="yellow">You must feel guilty about something too.</font>

313
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,550
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung told you to do it, right?</font>

314
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,360
<font color="yellow">The two of you planned this
and you're trying to screw me over.</font>

315
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,660
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung, you, Hong Seol...</font>

316
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,530
<font color="yellow">And that thug too.
I'm going to sue you all.</font>

317
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,780
<font color="yellow">I will never settle.</font>

318
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,380
<font color="yellow">Who do they think they're dealing with?</font>

319
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,080
<font color="yellow"><i>You're going to sue? You?</i></font>

320
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Stalking, attempted assault.</i></font>

321
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Threatening, defamation, and contempt.</i></font>

322
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,170
<font color="yellow"><i>I assume you're going to sue because
you're prepared to deal with all this.</i></font>

323
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,230
<font color="yellow">What... what is this?
My face is showing in these.</font>

324
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,450
<font color="yellow">My face is in all of these. You bastards!</font>

325
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,250
<font color="yellow">My face!</font>

326
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,220
<font color="yellow">Don't send them. Please don't send them.</font>

327
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,570
<font color="yellow">You only approached me to do this,
didn't you?</font>

328
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,710
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill you all.</font>

329
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,760
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare show yourself to me.</font>

330
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,800
<font color="yellow"><i>You talk a lot for a guy who can't even
tell when someone's being fake.</i></font>

331
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,410
<font color="yellow">Fake... fake...</font>

332
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,900
<font color="yellow">He's totally fake. Can't you see it?
He's completely fake!</font>

333
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you all talking when you can't
even tell someone's being fake?</font>

334
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,770
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm returning that phrase to you.</i></font>

335
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,400
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung.</font>

336
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, should I really scare you?</i></font>

337
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,080
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I make you shake in fear
every time you go home?</i></font>

338
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,200
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I make it so you can't go to
school anymore?</i></font>

339
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,650
<font color="yellow">You're Yoo Jung, aren't you?</font>

340
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,780
<font color="yellow">Is that what's important?</font>

341
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,410
<font color="yellow">You better behave yourself from now on.</font>

342
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,250
<font color="yellow">Or I'll be putting that video up
on the school site too.</font>

343
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,540
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

344
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,890
<font color="yellow">Come out now.</font>

345
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,080
<font color="yellow">Come out, you bastard!</font>

346
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,160
<font color="yellow">This is my last warning.</font>

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
<font color="yellow">It would be best if you didn't show up
in front of me.</font>

348
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,080
<font color="yellow">He... Hello?</font>

349
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,670
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

350
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,390
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at!</font>

351
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,730
<font color="yellow">Get lost!</font>

352
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,440
<font color="yellow">Get lost! I said get lost!</font>

353
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,030
<font color="yellow">Those bastards!</font>

354
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,300
<font color="yellow">They totally got me.</font>

355
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,380
<font color="yellow">They totally got me.</font>

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,790
<font color="yellow"><i>You received my phone, right?</i></font>

357
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,570
<font color="yellow"><i>I think we're done crushing that loser.</i></font>

358
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,770
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll receive your gratitude later
after I get back everything that's mine.</i></font>

359
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,910
<font color="yellow">Isn't the weather nice, children?</font>

360
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,960
<font color="yellow">Should we go have fun in our house?</font>

361
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,680
<font color="yellow"><i>I won't need anything more from you.</i></font>

362
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,510
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know. Do you think so?</i></font>

363
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,410
<font color="yellow">I'll get you some friends before we go.</font>

364
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,600
<font color="yellow">Where should I get them from?</font>

365
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,750
<font color="yellow">I deleted the posts I put up.</font>

366
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,160
<font color="yellow">The person who put up the new posts
on the school site...</font>

367
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,080
<font color="yellow">- The person who put them up...
- Okay, it was me!</font>

368
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,860
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong?</font>

369
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,360
<font color="yellow">I think I did well.</font>

370
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, was it really you?</font>

371
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
<font color="yellow">What if you get sued for it?</font>

372
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,890
<font color="yellow">Seol said she'd take care of it
and not to do it.</font>

373
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,390
<font color="yellow">Hong was in trouble last night
and that's why I did it.</font>

374
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,290
<font color="yellow">I wanted to end it for good.</font>

375
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,590
<font color="yellow">You have no fear, do you?</font>

376
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,960
<font color="yellow">You had that trouble with Oh Young Gon
last year too.</font>

377
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are you going to do, Hong?</font>

378
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,630
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you tell Senior?</font>

379
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,740
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

380
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,360
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't tell them we fought again.</i></font>

381
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:07,020
<font color="yellow">I don't want Senior to know about
Oh Young Gon.</font>

382
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,300
<font color="yellow">Ah, well...</font>

383
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,220
<font color="yellow">Um, well...</font>

384
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,500
<font color="yellow">Hong, um...</font>

385
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,730
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Uh...</font>

386
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,030
<font color="yellow">Well, actually...</font>

387
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,570
<font color="yellow">- What happened this time...
- What?</font>

388
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,460
<font color="yellow">Yoo... Yoo Jung helped me out with it.</font>

389
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,230
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Hey! What happened?</font>

390
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,780
<font color="yellow">It's been since midterms.</font>

391
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,220
<font color="yellow">I told everything regarding Young Gon
to Yoo Jung.</font>

392
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,090
<font color="yellow">I shared all the pictures and videos.</font>

393
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,630
<font color="yellow">It was Yoo Jung who said to put it up
on the school site too.</font>

394
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,220
<font color="yellow"><i>Senior knew everything?</i></font>

395
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,590
<font color="yellow">So you want me to put up all the things
Young Gon wrote on the school site?</font>

396
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,590
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

397
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,700
<font color="yellow">That way everyone at school can see it.</font>

398
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,920
<font color="yellow">He cares about what other people think,
so I think that will be good.</font>

399
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I guess you are right.</font>

400
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,390
<font color="yellow">Take out anything to do with Seol.</font>

401
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,970
<font color="yellow">Only put up the things Young Gon wrote
about people at school.</font>

402
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,050
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling us now?</font>

403
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,150
<font color="yellow">Because Yoo Jung was waiting
until Seol told him herself.</font>

404
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,020
<font color="yellow">That's why I didn't say anything.</font>

405
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,210
<font color="yellow">Senior isn't ordinary.</font>

406
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,060
<font color="yellow">His girlfriend was being stalked
and harassed, so how...</font>

407
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,070
<font color="yellow">Could you act that way?</font>

408
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,310
<font color="yellow">Oh no! I'd run right over
and just pound his head in.</font>

409
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:36,140
<font color="yellow">If anyone bothers you, I'll fly over
and chew them up with my gold teeth.</font>

410
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,650
<font color="yellow">And then I'll make a gold ring for you.</font>

411
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,900
<font color="yellow">That's not necessary.</font>

412
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,880
<font color="yellow">You're a bit much too.</font>

413
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,510
<font color="yellow">How could you let things go this far
and not say anything to Senior?</font>

414
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,910
<font color="yellow">If it were me, I'd be so angry
and tell him everything every single day.</font>

415
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave now. Sorry.</font>

416
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,350
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

417
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,040
<font color="yellow">They are kind of alike
if you think about it.</font>

418
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,690
<font color="yellow">They aren't very ordinary.</font>

419
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,930
<font color="yellow">I guess people who are alike
are left together in the end.</font>

420
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,290
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

421
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,730
<font color="yellow">I just need to give you a gold ring now.</font>

422
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,220
<font color="yellow"><i>You're going to get hurt by Yoo Jung
at some point.</i></font>

423
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Think about it carefully.</i></font>

424
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,970
<font color="yellow">Why would he have sent me to you
last year?</font>

425
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,490
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung threatened me and made me
throw away his report.</font>

426
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,910
<font color="yellow">So you could have the scholarship.</font>

427
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,190
<font color="yellow">This hand...</font>

428
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,520
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung did it.</font>

429
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,010
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Yoo Jung.</font>

430
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,200
<font color="yellow">He's not everything he seems.</font>

431
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,550
<font color="yellow">Senior, please say something.</font>

432
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,710
<font color="yellow">You're the one who chose the topic
and you even sent the slides to me.</font>

433
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,360
<font color="yellow">I understand Jung.</font>

434
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,250
<font color="yellow">So with understanding and compassion,
we have a give and take relationship.</font>

435
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,390
<font color="yellow">Both parties win.</font>

436
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,640
<font color="yellow"><i>So if you don't think you can handle it,
just leave already.</i></font>

437
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,560
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't make Jung suffer for no reason.</i></font>

438
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,010
<font color="yellow">Hey, Baek In Ha!</font>

439
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,320
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Mister.</font>

440
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,690
<font color="yellow">You're already home. Where are you going?</font>

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,180
<font color="yellow">You can go, sir.</font>

442
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,040
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

443
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, In Ho? Are you going to work?</font>

444
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,500
<font color="yellow">Where did you get the money for this?</font>

445
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, this?</font>

446
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,570
<font color="yellow">Jung gave it to me.</font>

447
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,230
<font color="yellow">- Yoo Jung?
- Yeah.</font>

448
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,390
<font color="yellow">He took all your money,
but then gave you this?</font>

449
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,910
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- You should learn to lie better.</font>

450
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,450
<font color="yellow">Seriously, I need to get my own place
and leave already.</font>

451
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,830
<font color="yellow">Aren't you being too nosy
just because we live together?</font>

452
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,000
<font color="yellow">If you don't tell me everything,
I'm going to throw this out.</font>

453
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

454
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,460
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

455
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,600
<font color="yellow">Be careful! Give that back.</font>

456
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,960
<font color="yellow">Can I come in?</font>

457
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,200
<font color="yellow">Come here. Sit down.</font>

458
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,820
<font color="yellow">Why did he give you this?</font>

459
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,680
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't know if I told you.</font>

460
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,360
<font color="yellow">I know, so just tell me.</font>

461
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,650
<font color="yellow">I made a deal with Jung.</font>

462
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,950
<font color="yellow">What deal?</font>

463
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,140
<font color="yellow">About Hong Shil or Hong Sam, that girl.</font>

464
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,320
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to get rid of that loser
he had stuck on her before.</font>

465
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,000
<font color="yellow">- So I did.
- Loser?</font>

466
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,470
<font color="yellow">Would you even know if I told you?
There's this guy. A loser.</font>

467
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,780
<font color="yellow">Who is the loser?</font>

468
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,570
<font color="yellow">You mean stalker?</font>

469
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,590
<font color="yellow">Oh, you know so well!
You know everything about her!</font>

470
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,520
<font color="yellow">So in return for getting rid of him,
you got this?</font>

471
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,810
<font color="yellow">Hey, what could I do?</font>

472
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,400
<font color="yellow">Jung needed me so much.</font>

473
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,920
<font color="yellow">You just don't know anything,
but do you know how busy I was?</font>

474
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,000
<font color="yellow">Jung looks for me when he needs anything.
He only depends on me.</font>

475
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
<font color="yellow">What can I do? I had to help him.</font>

476
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,200
<font color="yellow">Then I got my cards re-opened
and bought these things myself.</font>

477
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,320
<font color="yellow">Don't touch them!</font>

478
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,880
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

479
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,660
<font color="yellow">It was Yoo Jung who got you
to bring that loser around.</font>

480
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,510
<font color="yellow">And it's now Yoo Jung
who's trying to get rid of him too?</font>

481
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,140
<font color="yellow">Then... he's just playing around, right?</font>

482
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,620
<font color="yellow">He was playing her.</font>

483
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,390
<font color="yellow">Go and ask him.</font>

484
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,890
<font color="yellow">He was playing around from the beginning.
Yoo Jung, that jerk.</font>

485
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,310
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, why...</font>

486
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,680
<font color="yellow">did you just leave like that?</font>

487
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,090
<font color="yellow">Was it because I looked friendly
with Baek In Ho?</font>

488
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,260
<font color="yellow">Is that why you didn't answer my calls?</font>

489
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,030
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

490
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,440
<font color="yellow">I was busy. That's why.</font>

491
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,480
<font color="yellow">Oh really?</font>

492
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,170
<font color="yellow">Baek In Ho and I...</font>

493
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,950
<font color="yellow">To be honest, we have gotten closer.</font>

494
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,670
<font color="yellow">I received a lot of help from him lately.</font>

495
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,650
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to help him too.</font>

496
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,970
<font color="yellow">I wanted to help him play the piano.</font>

497
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,320
<font color="yellow">And I wanted to help him get his GED.</font>

498
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,100
<font color="yellow">That's everything there is
regarding Baek In Ho.</font>

499
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,370
<font color="yellow">As for Oh Young Gon...</font>

500
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,240
<font color="yellow">You've heard everything from Eun Taek.</font>

501
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,260
<font color="yellow">You know he even came to my home
yesterday.</font>

502
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,590
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

503
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,440
<font color="yellow">It seemed like you didn't want
to talk about it.</font>

504
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,970
<font color="yellow">I just pretended not to know.</font>

505
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
about that beforehand.</font>

506
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,250
<font color="yellow">I didn't feel comfortable talking about
these things with you.</font>

507
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,060
<font color="yellow">Well, it's all over now.</font>

508
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,650
<font color="yellow">- Let's stop talking about it.
- No.</font>

509
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,860
<font color="yellow">It's not over.</font>

510
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,850
<font color="yellow">Right now...</font>

511
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,890
<font color="yellow">I'm trying really hard.</font>

512
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,420
<font color="yellow">And saying all of this to you.</font>

513
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,050
<font color="yellow">Now, I want to hear your answer.</font>

514
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,040
<font color="yellow">What answer?</font>

515
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,580
<font color="yellow">Your honest answer.</font>

516
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,160
<font color="yellow">Do you feel like I'm hiding something?</font>

517
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,310
<font color="yellow">There's that answer you always give.</font>

518
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,160
<font color="yellow">"I didn't know Oh Young Gon
would go that far."</font>

519
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,610
<font color="yellow">"I didn't intend for it to go that far."</font>

520
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,780
<font color="yellow">These are not the answers that I want.</font>

521
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,960
<font color="yellow">Then what?</font>

522
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,890
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want me to say?</font>

523
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,400
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about Oh Young Gon.</font>

524
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,580
<font color="yellow">This isn't an Oh Young Gon problem.</font>

525
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,330
<font color="yellow">This is a problem between us.</font>

526
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,170
<font color="yellow">Stop avoiding it.</font>

527
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,950
<font color="yellow">"Seol, I sent that text to Oh Young Gon
because I disliked you so much."</font>

528
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,460
<font color="yellow">"I didn't miss your calls
because I was busy."</font>

529
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,800
<font color="yellow">"I was angry because of Baek In Ho,
so I avoided them on purpose."</font>

530
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,590
<font color="yellow">These are the answers that I want.</font>

531
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,670
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

532
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,190
<font color="yellow">do you want to hear things like that?</font>

533
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,860
<font color="yellow">I said many times.</font>

534
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,590
<font color="yellow">I asked you to be honest with me.</font>

535
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,290
<font color="yellow">And when you weren't,
it made me angry and frustrated.</font>

536
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,370
<font color="yellow">I thought it was all your fault.</font>

537
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,890
<font color="yellow">But I realized something this time.</font>

538
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,810
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell you my inner feelings.</font>

539
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,670
<font color="yellow">And I demanded you be honest
about your feelings.</font>

540
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,100
<font color="yellow">I won't do that anymore.</font>

541
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,640
<font color="yellow">So I want you to do that too.</font>

542
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,230
<font color="yellow">Don't hide things anymore.</font>

543
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,330
<font color="yellow">I want to see you the way you are.</font>

544
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,730
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

545
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,650
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll take you home.</font>

546
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,890
<font color="yellow">Baek In Ha, what's with you?</font>

547
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,510
<font color="yellow">Just to get stuff like this,
you do chores for Yoo Jung.</font>

548
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you have pride? Are you his toy?</font>

549
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,630
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

550
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,550
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

551
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,550
<font color="yellow">So pathetic.</font>

552
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,210
<font color="yellow">Pride? Does that feed me or house me?</font>

553
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,390
<font color="yellow">Who are you to be concerned about me?
What right do you have?</font>

554
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,620
<font color="yellow">To me, you're much more of a bad guy
than Jung will ever be.</font>

555
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,700
<font color="yellow">Do you know that?</font>

556
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,990
<font color="yellow">This is so expensive!
How dare you kick it.</font>

557
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
<font color="yellow">Tada!</font>

558
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,890
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Look.</font>

559
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,530
<font color="yellow">Daniel Redkovich?</font>

560
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,030
<font color="yellow">- That pianist you always talk about?
- Yeah.</font>

561
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,650
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I'd get to see his concert
before I die.</font>

562
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,810
<font color="yellow">But he's coming here to Korea.</font>

563
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,490
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

564
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,510
<font color="yellow">I'm going to look online and find
the sheet music for his arrangements.</font>

565
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,080
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get him to sign it
and keep it forever.</font>

566
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,920
<font color="yellow">Isn't this on the day
of your piano concours?</font>

567
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll skip it.</font>

568
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,100
<font color="yellow">Annoyingly, it's on the same day.</font>

569
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,200
<font color="yellow">You can't, man. My dad's going too.</font>

570
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,840
<font color="yellow">No, who knows when he's coming back.</font>

571
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,450
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

572
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,170
<font color="yellow">If you really want to go,
you can try to convince my dad.</font>

573
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you unfeeling jerk.</font>

574
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,960
<font color="yellow">Only your name is Yoo Jung [AFFECTION].
You actually have no feelings.</font>

575
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,170
<font color="yellow">My joke is funny, right?</font>

576
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,950
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's go play piano.</font>

577
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,740
<font color="yellow">Why would I go there?</font>

578
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,530
<font color="yellow">I'll be bored. Just come watch.</font>

579
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,940
<font color="yellow">Come in. I'll be bored.</font>

580
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,180
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jung.</font>

581
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,630
<font color="yellow">Hey, Yong Soo.</font>

582
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,720
<font color="yellow">Are you attending the concours too?</font>

583
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,510
<font color="yellow">Yeah. You knew?</font>

584
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,210
<font color="yellow">Right, you get support from
Yoo Jung's family too.</font>

585
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,310
<font color="yellow">Why don't you do better then?
How come you never win a prize?</font>

586
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,250
<font color="yellow">What is this?
Are you studying for a test?</font>

587
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,580
<font color="yellow">What? This is why you don't do well.</font>

588
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,200
<font color="yellow">Your playing has no soul.</font>

589
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,520
<font color="yellow">Hurry. Go and don't practice.</font>

590
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,910
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

591
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,650
<font color="yellow">Be careful how you talk.</font>

592
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,990
<font color="yellow">What? I'm saying it all for his own good.</font>

593
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,860
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm not going to the competition
this time.</font>

594
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,210
<font color="yellow">- Baek In Ho.
- What?</font>

595
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,660
<font color="yellow">I've been in first many times.</font>

596
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,040
<font color="yellow">I'll rest this time
and place first next time.</font>

597
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,070
<font color="yellow">I thought Jung was coming with you.
Why isn't he here?</font>

598
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,850
<font color="yellow">He said he had to be somewhere.</font>

599
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,890
<font color="yellow">He said he'd come before it ends.</font>

600
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,510
<font color="yellow">It's not just any other day though.</font>

601
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,020
<font color="yellow">There's not much going on at school,
is there?</font>

602
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,150
<font color="yellow">If there were, I would have told you
already.</font>

603
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,780
<font color="yellow">- Mister?
- Yes.</font>

604
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,580
<font color="yellow">Where are we going to eat today?</font>

605
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,860
<font color="yellow">That restaurant near here
was really good.</font>

606
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,970
<font color="yellow">- Oh yeah? Then we'll go there.
- Yes.</font>

607
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,630
<font color="yellow">I have something to talk about too.</font>

608
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,050
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

609
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,520
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah!</font>

610
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,420
<font color="yellow">Adopt?</font>

611
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,660
<font color="yellow">I see you're very surprised.</font>

612
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,920
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time
since you both came to stay.</font>

613
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,260
<font color="yellow">Now we're pretty much like family.</font>

614
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:55,100
<font color="yellow">And I'd like if you were
like real siblings to Jung in the future.</font>

615
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,540
<font color="yellow">So before it's too late, I'm thinking of
adding you two to our family register.</font>

616
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,600
<font color="yellow">What do you two think?</font>

617
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,760
<font color="yellow">You don't need to decide right now.</font>

618
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,890
<font color="yellow">Take your time and think about it, okay?</font>

619
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,130
<font color="yellow">No, I don't like it!</font>

620
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,490
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

621
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,240
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't you like it?
We'll become a real family.</font>

622
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,100
<font color="yellow">Family, yeah right.</font>

623
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,140
<font color="yellow">I have to marry Jung.
I can't be registered in his family.</font>

624
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,680
<font color="yellow">- Think about it.
- You're still saying that?</font>

625
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,440
<font color="yellow">You think just because you ask,
he'll do it?</font>

626
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,760
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill you.</font>

627
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,510
<font color="yellow">Stop saying nonsense
and just do what Jung's dad says.</font>

628
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Jung won't like it either.</font>

629
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,040
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

630
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,080
<font color="yellow">He did seem taken aback,
but so were we.</font>

631
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,920
<font color="yellow">He definitely didn't have an expression
of not liking it.</font>

632
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,050
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's his sincere feeling?</font>

633
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,790
<font color="yellow">Do you still not know Jung at all?</font>

634
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,930
<font color="yellow">I know him better than you.</font>

635
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,990
<font color="yellow"><i>- Is this really for me?
- Of course.</i></font>

636
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,560
<font color="yellow"><i>This is really hard to get. Wow...</i></font>

637
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,100
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's the big fuss?</font>

638
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,660
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

639
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,670
<font color="yellow">A signed Daniel Redkovich CD?</font>

640
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,290
<font color="yellow">That's mine. Give it to me.</font>

641
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,610
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

642
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,340
<font color="yellow">Jung, I'll see you in class.</font>

643
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

644
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,700
<font color="yellow">Hey... hey!</font>

645
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,780
<font color="yellow">I gave it to him.</font>

646
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

647
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,910
<font color="yellow">I went to that concert.</font>

648
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

649
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,310
<font color="yellow">So you didn't come to my concours
and went to that concert? So...</font>

650
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving that to him?</font>

651
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,700
<font color="yellow">I thought it would good for Yong Soo
to hear.</font>

652
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you mad at me about something?</font>

653
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,790
<font color="yellow">- No.
- What do you mean no?</font>

654
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,620
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm stupid?
It's totally obvious.</font>

655
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,790
<font color="yellow">Is it because of that?</font>

656
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,120
<font color="yellow">- What your dad said...
- The adoption?</font>

657
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,480
<font color="yellow">That's Dad's decision.</font>

658
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,430
<font color="yellow">Not your dad. How about you?
How do you feel about it?</font>

659
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,450
<font color="yellow">If you don't like it, just say so.
What kind of a guy...</font>

660
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,810
<font color="yellow">It makes no difference to me.</font>

661
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,720
<font color="yellow">It makes no difference?</font>

662
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,570
<font color="yellow">So you don't like it or dislike it?
It makes no difference to you?</font>

663
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, it makes no difference.</font>

664
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,510
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung, what do you do on the weekend?</i></font>

665
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,250
<font color="yellow">I just stay home if I have nothing to do.</font>

666
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
<font color="yellow">How about you?</font>

667
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,080
<font color="yellow">I just study or go for a walk.</font>

668
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,660
<font color="yellow">I go fishing. Have you been fishing?</font>

669
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,880
<font color="yellow">No, never.</font>

670
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,100
<font color="yellow">You've never fished?</font>

671
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,980
<font color="yellow">I went fishing last weekend.</font>

672
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,080
<font color="yellow">I caught a 30-centimeter fish and then...</font>

673
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,620
<font color="yellow">- Right on that spot...
- Gosh, this tastes bad.</font>

674
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,630
<font color="yellow">You're making me lose my appetite.
Just have an orange.</font>

675
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:10,240
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung, I prepared
these incredible girls just for you.</font>

676
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,790
<font color="yellow">You know that place "Remember,"
right?</font>

677
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,860
<font color="yellow">8:00 p.m. at "Remember."</font>

678
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,100
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting. See you.</font>

679
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,850
<font color="yellow">- Make sure to come.
- My English sounds good today.</font>

680
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,580
<font color="yellow">Remember!</font>

681
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,270
<font color="yellow">- Yong Soo.
- Yeah, Jung.</font>

682
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,110
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere with those guys?</font>

683
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,030
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- That place "Remember."</font>

684
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,060
<font color="yellow">Don't they hang out in dangerous places?</font>

685
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,430
<font color="yellow">They're not so bad
once you get to know them.</font>

686
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,400
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to go too?
- Me?</font>

687
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,460
<font color="yellow">With you?</font>

688
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,990
<font color="yellow">Sure, I'll go too.</font>

689
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,470
<font color="yellow">Hey, why don't you practice instead of
going to places like that?</font>

690
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,420
<font color="yellow">Baek In Ho, do you want to go too?</font>

691
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,170
<font color="yellow">Forget it, it's obvious
what they're going to do there.</font>

692
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,040
<font color="yellow">Is that what you do these days...</font>

693
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,390
<font color="yellow">Anyway, be careful.</font>

694
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,690
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything weird.
You're in trouble if your dad finds out.</font>

695
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,860
<font color="yellow">How would Dad find out
unless someone tells on me?</font>

696
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,890
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

697
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,780
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

698
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,010
<font color="yellow">I heard
you're attending another concours.</font>

699
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,610
<font color="yellow">You should be practicing instead of
going to places like that.</font>

700
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,190
<font color="yellow">You're getting financial support.</font>

701
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,390
<font color="yellow">What if you can't even make it
past preliminary round?</font>

702
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,710
<font color="yellow">Watch your expression.</font>

703
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,220
<font color="yellow"><i>Cheers, cheers!</i></font>

704
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,490
<font color="yellow">You're all so tacky.
I'm not sure we can hang out with you.</font>

705
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you have whiskey?</font>

706
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,560
<font color="yellow">Pour a little bit at a time and drink it.
Then it tastes good.</font>

707
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,490
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

708
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,050
<font color="yellow">Jung said he'd be here.</font>

709
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,220
<font color="yellow">Yoo Jung? Did he say he'd come?</font>

710
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,390
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

711
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,450
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

712
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,110
<font color="yellow">Nice going!</font>

713
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,640
<font color="yellow">How old are you that
you're already drinking with girls?</font>

714
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,650
<font color="yellow">You get caught
and dirty your school's name!</font>

715
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,010
<font color="yellow">Hey, Park Yong Soo.
Why are you in this group?</font>

716
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,730
<font color="yellow">Am I really not allowed to go to
my piano concours?</font>

717
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,140
<font color="yellow">You sure are funny.</font>

718
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,050
<font color="yellow">You got caught too.
You want to be the only one unpunished?</font>

719
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,390
<font color="yellow">Who told you to hang out
with guys like this?</font>

720
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,700
<font color="yellow">Get down on the floor. Get down!</font>

721
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,890
<font color="yellow">Who ratted us out?</font>

722
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,940
<font color="yellow">No one knew about that place but us.</font>

723
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,780
<font color="yellow"><i>You should be practicing instead of
going to places like that.</i></font>

724
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,290
<font color="yellow">You're getting financial support.</font>

725
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,600
<font color="yellow">What if you can't even make it
past the preliminary round?</font>

726
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,390
<font color="yellow">I know who.</font>

727
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

728
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,620
<font color="yellow">I know who reported us.</font>

729
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,050
<font color="yellow">- Let go.
- You reported us to the cops.</font>

730
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,390
<font color="yellow">Get up, you punk.</font>

731
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,800
<font color="yellow">- You want to die?
- Let go, punk!</font>

732
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,880
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me, you crazy bastards!</font>

733
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,550
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

734
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,570
<font color="yellow">Stop it, you punks!</font>

735
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,590
<font color="yellow">It's all your fault!</font>

736
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

737
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,820
<font color="yellow">I really just...</font>

738
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,170
<font color="yellow">wanted you to become siblings to Jung.</font>

739
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,230
<font color="yellow">Was it that uncomfortable?</font>

740
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,060
<font color="yellow">In Ho.</font>

741
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,880
<font color="yellow">It's not true, right?</font>

742
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,370
<font color="yellow">That it was you.</font>

743
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,000
<font color="yellow">What should I say
to put your mind at ease?</font>

744
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,370
<font color="yellow">Was it really you?</font>

745
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,800
<font color="yellow">I'm asking if it was really
you who did it.</font>

746
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,270
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

747
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,030
<font color="yellow">You're the one who did it, not me.</font>

748
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,180
<font color="yellow">Give it some thought.</font>

749
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,600
<font color="yellow">You son of a bitch.</font>

750
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,560
<font color="yellow">Why on earth did you do that to me?</font>

751
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,410
<font color="yellow">Why on earth did you do it?</font>

752
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,580
<font color="yellow">Why is it that people covet
what doesn't belong to them?</font>

753
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,600
<font color="yellow">They mistakenly think that what actually
belongs to someone else is theirs</font>

754
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,700
<font color="yellow">and ultimately lose what belongs to them.</font>

755
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,930
<font color="yellow">Did you do this to me...</font>

756
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,980
<font color="yellow">because you hated the idea of us
being adopted into your family?</font>

757
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,000
<font color="yellow">Just because of that?</font>

758
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,350
<font color="yellow">Think whatever you want.</font>

759
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,200
<font color="yellow">Baek In Ho!</font>

760
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,870
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

761
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,980
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

762
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,090
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Don't wait up for me.</font>

763
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,630
<font color="yellow">Fine. Go on.</font>

764
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,600
<font color="yellow">You're always like this.</font>

765
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,670
<font color="yellow">I must've momentarily forgotten.</font>

766
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,370
<font color="yellow">You're someone who can abandon me
whenever he wants to.</font>

767
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,790
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

768
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,860
<font color="yellow">You better leave and never come back.</font>

769
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,810
<font color="yellow">I'll do fine on my own.</font>

770
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,720
<font color="yellow">Just try and come back!</font>

771
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,240
<font color="yellow">I won't stand for it.</font>

772
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you for driving me home.</font>

773
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,770
<font color="yellow">Seol.</font>

774
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,410
<font color="yellow">I'm going.</font>

775
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,690
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you? Come see me.</i></font>

776
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,210
<font color="yellow">What have you done to Baek In Ha?</font>

777
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,550
<font color="yellow">I guess she couldn't wait
and opened her mouth.</font>

778
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:21,000
<font color="yellow">Acting like a victim
while getting everything she wants...</font>

779
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,750
<font color="yellow">- I'm sick and tired of it now.
- This jerk, to the very end...</font>

780
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,010
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to
keep hanging around Seol?</font>

781
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,600
<font color="yellow">It seems like you're doing it
to make me upset.</font>

782
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,560
<font color="yellow">But doesn't it seem
pathetic to you, too?</font>

783
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,600
<font color="yellow">Come to your senses
and think of your future.</font>

784
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,660
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

785
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,880
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you for a favor.</font>

786
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,640
<font color="yellow">Let me punch you just this once.</font>

787
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,390
<font color="yellow">I really want to hit you.</font>

788
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,390
<font color="yellow">One fight, man to man.</font>

789
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,910
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

790
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,170
<font color="yellow">Sounds good.</font>

791
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,700
<font color="yellow">Fine, let's try to kill each other
tonight, you son of a bitch.</font>

792
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,880
<font color="yellow">Tonight sounds real good, you jerk!</font>

793
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,410
<font color="yellow">Let's try to kill you!</font>

794
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,590
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

795
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:37,180
<font color="yellow">I've put up with you long enough.</font>

796
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,630
<font color="yellow">What a load of shit, you bastard!</font>

797
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,280
<font color="yellow">Get up, you bastard.</font>

798
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,390
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

799
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,020
<font color="yellow">How did a guy who's so good at
beating people up hold back for so long?</font>

800
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:13,150
<font color="yellow">You should've showed your true colors
sooner, you double-faced bastard!</font>

801
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,530
<font color="yellow">If you had done so, our friendship
would've never gotten this bad.</font>

802
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,580
<font color="yellow">Blaming me again, are you?</font>

803
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,080
<font color="yellow">This bastard keeps acting like a victim
while coveting what's not his...</font>

804
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,690
<font color="yellow">What about you then?</font>

805
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,850
<font color="yellow">You get your hackles up like a porcupine
whenever anyone provokes you.</font>

806
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,140
<font color="yellow">You sent a stalker to the subway</font>

807
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,980
<font color="yellow">and now you're trying to use someone
to get rid of that same stalker.</font>

808
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,830
<font color="yellow">Is that your way of protecting Dog Fur?</font>

809
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,500
<font color="yellow">Shut up, you bastard.</font>

810
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,860
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

811
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,190
<font color="yellow">But still!</font>

812
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,390
<font color="yellow">I thought that your feelings
for Dog Fur were genuine.</font>

813
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,730
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what it means
to like someone, you son of a bitch?</font>

814
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,170
<font color="yellow">What does it matter to you?</font>

815
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,220
<font color="yellow">Because I like Dog Fur.</font>

816
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,550
<font color="yellow">It matters to me because
I like Dog Fur, you bastard!</font>

817
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,510
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

818
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,700
<font color="yellow">This is what you're best at.</font>

819
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,120
<font color="yellow">You act like a friend, but then
you stab people in the back!</font>

820
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,290
<font color="yellow">Who stabbed whom in the back first?</font>

821
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,510
<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

822
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,800
<font color="yellow">This isn't considered stabbing
someone in the back, is it?</font>

823
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,690
<font color="yellow">Stay away from Seol!</font>

824
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,130
<font color="yellow">Says who?</font>

825
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,910
<font color="yellow">Geez!</font>

826
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,090
<font color="yellow">So what can you do for Seol?</font>

827
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,580
<font color="yellow">Your own life is cumbersome enough.</font>

828
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,440
<font color="yellow">Then tell me, you bastard.</font>

829
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,900
<font color="yellow">Just like you did to me...</font>

830
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,440
<font color="yellow">can you guarantee that you won't
do the same to Dog Fur?</font>

831
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,330
<font color="yellow">Are you confident
about that, you bastard?</font>

832
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,740
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

833
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,700
<font color="yellow">A son of a bitch like you</font>

834
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,390
<font color="yellow">will eventually show
his true colors in time.</font>

835
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,110
<font color="yellow">Even if someone like me knows that</font>

836
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,990
<font color="yellow">you think Dog Fur won't be able
to figure it out?</font>

837
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,760
<font color="yellow">Hide what's actually worth hiding,
you bastard!</font>

838
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,410
<font color="yellow">You're the reason why
everyone's lives are ultimately ruined.</font>

839
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,200
<font color="yellow">The one who should truly
stay away from Dog Fur...</font>

840
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,060
<font color="yellow">isn't me, but you, you bastard.</font>

841
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,250
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard!</font>

842
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,690
<font color="yellow">Ow, seriously.</font>

843
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,600
<font color="yellow">You bastard.</font>

844
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,310
<font color="yellow">How long will it take for you
to come to your senses and...</font>

845
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,490
<font color="yellow">You're the one who should
stay away from her, you bastard!</font>

846
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,540
<font color="yellow">Dog Fur... you bastard!</font>

847
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,480
<font color="yellow">- Hey...
- Let go!</font>

848
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,570
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

849
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,380
<font color="yellow">It hurts!</font>

850
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,150
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

851
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,880
<font color="yellow"><i>Seol, I'm standing outside your house.
Could you come out for a bit?</i></font>

852
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,450
<font color="yellow">What could it be?</font>

853
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,280
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

854
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,300
<font color="yellow">Senior!</font>

855
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,500
<font color="yellow">What's with your face?</font>

856
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,820
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Who did this to you?</font>

857
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,060
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

858
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,770
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

859
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,700
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

860
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,850
<font color="yellow">Look at your face.</font>

861
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,050
<font color="yellow">How are you going to go to work tomorrow?</font>

862
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,590
<font color="yellow">You fought with Baek In Ho, didn't you?</font>

863
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,090
<font color="yellow">He started it.</font>

864
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,310
<font color="yellow">So did you just agree to it
and fight him?</font>

865
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

866
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,370
<font color="yellow">You two used to only fight with words,
but now you're using your fists.</font>

867
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:22,200
<font color="yellow">Why? What's wrong?</font>

868
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,860
<font color="yellow">Let's say it was about
Baek In Ho's hand...</font>

869
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,590
<font color="yellow">but why did you do it?</font>

870
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,460
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

871
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,670
<font color="yellow">Still fighting over something
that happened in high school...</font>

872
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,300
<font color="yellow">I honestly don't get it.</font>

873
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,880
<font color="yellow">You're not the type to get into fights.</font>

874
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,890
<font color="yellow">Why do you hate Baek In Ho so much?</font>

875
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,930
<font color="yellow">- I have one more.
- Oh?</font>

876
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,420
<font color="yellow">I like this more than the original one.</font>

877
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,150
<font color="yellow">Is this my score?</font>

878
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,790
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is the arranged one!</font>

879
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,400
<font color="yellow">You're a real fan.
What's your name?</font>

880
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,230
<font color="yellow">In Ho Baek.</font>

881
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,990
<font color="yellow">Thanks for attending
my concert tonight, In Ho.</font>

882
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,870
<font color="yellow">Thanks. Thanks for playing tonight.</font>

883
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,200
<font color="yellow">- Hey, is it your turn?
- Yes.</font>

884
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,700
<font color="yellow">Did you hear me?
I totally got into the mood.</font>

885
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,750
<font color="yellow">The audience was so moved
by my performance...</font>

886
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:08,510
<font color="yellow">- I saw the Chairman is here.
- Mister?</font>

887
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,220
<font color="yellow">He came to see me tonight.</font>

888
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,160
<font color="yellow">He still comes even though
I tell him not to.</font>

889
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,390
<font color="yellow">But... how did you get to be
such good friends with Yoo Jung?</font>

890
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,210
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you want to
become friends with him too?</font>

891
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,040
<font color="yellow">Because Mister is your benefactor?</font>

892
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,990
<font color="yellow"><i>Dream on.</i></font>

893
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,210
<font color="yellow">He may smile at you, but on the inside,
he hates guys like you.</font>

894
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:34,420
<font color="yellow"><i>Yoo Jung hails from a wealthy family
and he's popular and a good student.</i></font>

895
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,790
<font color="yellow"><i>- Everyone envies him.
- Is that something to envy?</i></font>

896
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:39,780
<font color="yellow">It must be because
you don't hang out with him...</font>

897
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,440
<font color="yellow">He's a pitiful fellow
once you get to know him.</font>

898
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,500
<font color="yellow"><i>What good is it if your family is rich?</i></font>

899
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,360
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung has no dreams
and can't do anything he wants to do.</i></font>

900
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,600
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why things are so easy for him.</i></font>

901
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,610
<font color="yellow">I might be the only person
who understands him.</font>

902
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,520
<font color="yellow">He's a really pitiful guy.</font>

903
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,440
<font color="yellow">In any case, don't be nervous
and put on a good performance.</font>

904
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,780
<font color="yellow">Fighting!</font>

905
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,440
<font color="yellow">Adopt?</font>

906
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,400
<font color="yellow">Now we're pretty much like family.</font>

907
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:36,200
<font color="yellow">And I'd like if you were
like real siblings to Jung in the future.</font>

908
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,040
<font color="yellow">So before it's too late</font>

909
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,720
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of adding you two
to our family register.</font>

910
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,200
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

911
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,710
<font color="yellow"><i>I already had the idea of
adopting them on my mind.</i></font>

912
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,060
<font color="yellow">I've imposed on you so much,
Doctor Baek.</font>

913
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,490
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that I'll take care of
your grandchildren.</font>

914
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:04,290
<font color="yellow">Why on earth would you
say such a thing?</font>

915
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,740
<font color="yellow">Why would anyone who abandoned
their children try to get involved now?</font>

916
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,110
<font color="yellow">Jung won't be against the idea either.</font>

917
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,600
<font color="yellow">There's no reason for him
to be against it.</font>

918
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

919
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,280
<font color="yellow">Keep tabs on?</font>

920
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,380
<font color="yellow">How does that count
as keeping an eye on him?</font>

921
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,340
<font color="yellow">You know what Jung is like.</font>

922
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,970
<font color="yellow">It's not that I think he's strange,
but you said if he's left on his own</font>

923
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,450
<font color="yellow">he'd always have trouble with
personal relationships.</font>

924
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,860
<font color="yellow">If someone isn't by his side
to take care of him</font>

925
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,390
<font color="yellow">he can't survive on his own.</font>

926
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,220
<font color="yellow">That's why he needs siblings.</font>

927
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:41,770
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I've made this decision
for Jung's sake.</font>

928
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,270
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of
the kids' adoption process...</font>

929
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:49,450
<font color="yellow">so don't concern yourself
about this matter anymore.</font>

930
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,620
<font color="yellow"><i>It was from that time...</i></font>

931
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,200
<font color="yellow">It's not that I hated the idea
of them being adopted.</font>

932
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,960
<font color="yellow">It was a bit of a shock,
but I could accept it.</font>

933
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,360
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

934
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,720
<font color="yellow">but the people
whom I thought were my friends...</font>

935
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:13,150
<font color="yellow">that they were keeping tabs on me...</font>

936
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:16,560
<font color="yellow">It was hard to put up with that.</font>

937
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:21,380
<font color="yellow">Father knew everything.</font>

938
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,040
<font color="yellow">As if... he was always
watching over us.</font>

939
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,170
<font color="yellow">He always took hold of
my shoulder and told me...</font>

940
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,340
<font color="yellow">"Be meek." "Don't get greedy."</font>

941
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,780
<font color="yellow">"Always concede to others."</font>

942
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,680
<font color="yellow">As if I was being scolded
for doing something wrong.</font>

943
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,830
<font color="yellow">Did I really appear to be that strange?</font>

944
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:04,270
<font color="yellow">Do I... really seem...
that strange to you?</font>

945
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,980
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

946
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,370
<font color="yellow">We really didn't get along
in the beginning, didn't we?</font>

947
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,130
<font color="yellow">We both hated each other and treated
one another like weird people.</font>

948
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,710
<font color="yellow">But if I think about that now...</font>

949
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,570
<font color="yellow">we weren't weird...</font>

950
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,180
<font color="yellow">but I think we were different.</font>

951
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,690
<font color="yellow">You were like this...</font>

952
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,260
<font color="yellow">and I was like that.</font>

953
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:46,070
<font color="yellow">Just... different people like that.</font>

954
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:56,450
<font color="yellow">I used to frequently hear that I was
sensitive and frustrating to be around.</font>

955
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,200
<font color="yellow">So I worried a lot about that.</font>

956
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,350
<font color="yellow">But my conclusion was...</font>

957
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,430
<font color="yellow">"That's just who I am."</font>

958
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:15,200
<font color="yellow">I might not be fully certain,
but you, Senior...</font>

959
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,230
<font color="yellow">I don't think you had many chances
to be honest with people.</font>

960
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,510
<font color="yellow">It must've been really lonely for you.</font>

961
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,890
<font color="yellow">Don't have a hard time
on your own from now on.</font>

962
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,760
<font color="yellow">We'll go through it together.</font>

963
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:50,180
<font color="yellow">I really want to get to know you.</font>

964
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,360
<font color="yellow">I was scared.</font>

965
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:10,770
<font color="yellow">That you might leave me
if you found out who I truly am.</font>

966
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,560
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

967
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,510
<font color="yellow">like you a lot, Senior.</font>

968
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,060
<font color="yellow">Much more than before.</font>

969
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,590
<font color="yellow">You were different than
everyone else to begin with, Seol.</font>

970
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,600
<font color="yellow">You've always observed me...</font>

971
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,090
<font color="yellow">and it was always obvious
whenever you didn't like something.</font>

972
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:15,380
<font color="yellow">This may sound funny,
but I always found that helpful.</font>

973
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,390
<font color="yellow">No matter how minor
they may have seemed to you.</font>

974
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:26,410
<font color="yellow">It might have been because
you were scared of me.</font>

975
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,940
<font color="yellow">Scared that you might
end up provoking me.</font>

976
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,380
<font color="yellow">I don't like that.</font>

977
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,050
<font color="yellow">But it's not like that now.</font>

978
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,090
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

979
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,520
<font color="yellow">I'm scared that you might leave me.</font>

980
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,040
<font color="yellow">I like you a lot too.</font>

981
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,520
<font color="yellow">Very much.</font>

982
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,900
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

983
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,570
<font color="yellow">It hurts.</font>

984
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,290
<font color="yellow">Ah, it's cold. It's cold.</font>

985
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,490
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you put ointment on?</i></font>

986
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,630
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you want to give me that</i></font>

987
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,360
<font color="yellow"><i>when it wasn't enough to ask why
your boyfriend beat me up?</i></font>

988
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,600
<font color="yellow"><i>That sort of threat
doesn't work on me anymore.</i></font>

989
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,670
<font color="yellow"><i>- Seol knows everything now.
- How much does she know?</i></font>

990
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,990
<font color="yellow"><i>She won't ever be able to understand you.</i></font>

991
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:01,240
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, Hong! It's a paper!</i></font>

992
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,400
<font color="yellow"><i>All you need to do is graduate!</i></font>

993
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,720
<font color="yellow"><i>It's not a paper
you worked that hard at.</i></font>

994
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,940
<font color="yellow"><i>Does Hong know that you like her?</i></font>

995
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,100
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't hang around her
and act like her friend.</i></font>

996
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,900
<font color="yellow"><i>It's game over the moment she finds out!</i></font>

997
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,600
<font color="yellow"><i>We won't be alone by ourselves
other than when we're studying.</i></font>

998
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm giving you a week
for that 10 million won.</i></font>

999
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,520
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't get any funny ideas.</i></font>

1000
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I can ruin you and everyone around you.</i></font>

1001
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,110
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you have someone you like?</i></font>

1002
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't worry about
tutoring me anymore.</i></font>

1003
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,390
<font color="yellow"><i>- Is something wrong?
- What does it matter to you?</i></font>

1004
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:30,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, wake up! A doctor!</i></font>

1005
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,050
<font color="yellow"><i>Open your eyes! Dog Fur!</i></font>

1006
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Sorry. I'll make sure that you
never get hurt like this.</i></font>

1007
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,440
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll always be by your side.</i></font>
