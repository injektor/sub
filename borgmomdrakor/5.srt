1
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

2
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she trying to stand out
by herself?</font>

3
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,929
<font color=#FFFF00>She didn't have to direct traffic.
Why is she doing that by herself?</font>

4
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,229
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

5
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,900
<font color=#FFFF00>She also made the party awkward
yesterday.</font>

6
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,229
<font color=#FFFF00>She must like the attention.</font>

7
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll send you a signal
Tingling</font>

8
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,669
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, I'm so excited today.</font>

9
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,839
<font color=#FFFF00>You're taking me to school,</font>

10
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,110
<font color=#FFFF00>and Mom's already there.</font>

11
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,279
<font color=#FFFF00>- I wish it was like this every day.
- Really?</font>

12
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:46,479
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you happy?
- Yes.</font>

13
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,690
<font color=#FFFF00>That's Mom.</font>

14
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:04,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom rocks! She looks so cool.</font>

15
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,500
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

16
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. Can you that too, Mom?</font>

17
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,080
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom, can you do that for us too?
- Please?</font>

18
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

19
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,349
<font color=#FFFF00>- I said, let's go!
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

20
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you just...</font>

21
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,649
<font color=#FFFF00>going to watch her?</font>

22
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,019
<font color=#FFFF00>(Borg Mom)</font>

23
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,989
<font color=#FFFF00>(A malware virus has been detected.
Code Name: Outcast)</font>

24
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Yool, hurry inside.</font>

25
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,360
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom. Dad. Bye!
- Bye.</font>

26
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Borg Mom, go and get changed.
Let's go home together.</font>

27
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,339
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's not possible now.
- Why is that?</font>

28
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,809
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a meeting with the Elegance
Mother Committee.</font>

29
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,679
<font color=#FFFF00>- Today...
- Today's meeting...</font>

30
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,880
<font color=#FFFF00>has been canceled.</font>

31
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it canceled because of the rain?</font>

32
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,769
<font color=#FFFF00>You might feel better if you think
it's because of the rain.</font>

33
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,239
<font color=#FFFF00>What is she talking about?</font>

34
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever it is, it's canceled.
So let's go now.</font>

35
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Go get changed.</font>

36
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I will see you
after three minutes.</font>

37
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,189
<font color=#FFFF00>(1 hour ago)</font>

38
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,179
<font color=#FFFF00>The location of the outfit
has been changed.</font>

39
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,580
<font color=#FFFF00>An item that was not seen earlier
has been spotted.</font>

40
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,739
<font color=#FFFF00>Acquisition of the outfit's
new location is completed.</font>

41
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. It smells so bad.</font>

42
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Your clothes are all ruined.
What will you do?</font>

43
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure that I became
an Elegance Mother this time?</font>

44
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,739
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just...
- Just finish it well.</font>

45
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,480
<font color=#FFFF00>- You...
- You should hurry up.</font>

46
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Finish it, and come out.</font>

47
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

48
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to do this to become
an Elegance Mother.</font>

49
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

50
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm greeting you gladly
out of surprise.</font>

51
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you still wearing that?
What are these?</font>

52
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,530
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this smell?</font>

53
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,639
<font color=#FFFF00>These are my clothes.</font>

54
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,470
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to your clothes?</font>

55
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't found out the exact cause.</font>

56
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,879
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a mess. I'm sure...</font>

57
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,749
<font color=#FFFF00>that I clearly set the data for
personal belonging organization...</font>

58
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:46,989
<font color=#FFFF00>and cleanliness.
That's strange.</font>

59
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, let's go before
someone sees us.</font>

60
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,960
<font color=#FFFF00>According to my analysis,</font>

61
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,199
<font color=#FFFF00>you're embarrassed by me.</font>

62
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,270
<font color=#FFFF00>It might not seem like it, but it's
the trendy color of 2017, greenery.</font>

63
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, keep yourself 1m away
from me. Let's go.</font>

64
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,879
<font color=#FFFF00>The weather is so nice.</font>

65
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:34,329
<font color=#FFFF00>(Maintaining a distance of 1m)</font>

66
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm maintaining a distance of 1m.</font>

67
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,819
<font color=#FFFF00>That doesn't matter anymore.
What happened to your memory chip?</font>

68
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I will protect
my important parts.</font>

69
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,110
<font color=#FFFF00>(May 2, 2005,
The first day of class at college)</font>

70
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

71
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,379
<font color=#FFFF00>You're that guy
from the orientation.</font>

72
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,449
<font color=#FFFF00>That guy?</font>

73
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,619
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll have to hurry if you
don't want to be late for class.</font>

74
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,849
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the first class today,
but the professor is famous...</font>

75
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:36,819
<font color=#FFFF00>for being a psycho, and
he's really stern.</font>

76
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,990
<font color=#FFFF00>He's going to be really mad
if I'm late.</font>

77
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,589
<font color=#FFFF00>You should really hurry before
the psycho and really stern...</font>

78
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:45,160
<font color=#FFFF00>professor scolds you.</font>

79
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, let's go.</font>

80
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't forget this, and I'll repay
this kindness later.</font>

81
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,339
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

82
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry.</font>

83
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank goodness.</font>

84
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,050
<font color=#FFFF00>The professor isn't here yet, right?</font>

85
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Did the teaching assistant check
attendance?</font>

86
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, a minute ago.</font>

87
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I answered in place of you with
my naturally talented voice.</font>

88
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:15,959
<font color=#FFFF00>So treat me to lunch later.</font>

89
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, thank you.</font>

90
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:20,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I'd give a bad impression
of being late on the first day.</font>

91
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,429
<font color=#FFFF00>In my opinion,</font>

92
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:26,540
<font color=#FFFF00>you left a bad impression
in another way.</font>

93
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,140
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Why would I?</font>

94
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,709
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no reason for me to
leave a bad impression...</font>

95
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,609
<font color=#FFFF00>to a professor
I've never seen before.</font>

96
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know who the professor is
for this class?</font>

97
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

98
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,719
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the rumor of him being
a psycho and really stern.</font>

99
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Is there something else?</font>

100
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,890
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is there?
- She must not really know.</font>

101
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

102
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,160
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mi So.
- Yes?</font>

103
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,359
<font color=#FFFF00>My condolences to your future.</font>

104
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,599
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

105
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:55,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw that guy from the orientation
who couldn't drink alcohol well.</font>

106
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,969
<font color=#FFFF00>I met him.</font>

107
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,370
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- He's there.</font>

108
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,209
<font color=#FFFF00>That's him.</font>

109
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, everyone.</font>

110
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,020
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Professor Choi Go Bong, who
will teach the required subject...</font>

111
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,890
<font color=#FFFF00>"The Emotional Interaction
Between Cyborgs and Humans".</font>

112
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,829
<font color=#FFFF00>(Choi Go Bong)</font>

113
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he there?</font>

114
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor?</font>

115
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,209
<font color=#FFFF00>I will look forward
to this semester.</font>

116
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Since I became a professor
at a young age,</font>

117
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish I will be able
to communicate and spend...</font>

118
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,319
<font color=#FFFF00>time with you closely. But,</font>

119
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,349
<font color=#FFFF00>please don't mix drinks
and ask me to drink them for you.</font>

120
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Please verify the rumors
of me being...</font>

121
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,530
<font color=#FFFF00>a psycho from now on.</font>

122
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,359
<font color=#FFFF00>I will announce first...</font>

123
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,099
<font color=#FFFF00>that I'll be very strict in grading.</font>

124
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

125
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,380
<font color=#FFFF00>"If you drink this,"</font>

126
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,880
<font color=#FFFF00>"you'll go out with me."</font>

127
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,780
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, my.
- Gosh.</font>

128
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,050
<font color=#FFFF00>- Lee Mi So.
- Wasn't I like Son Ye Jin?</font>

129
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't I pretty?</font>

130
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,359
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

131
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:34,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't I really pretty?</font>

132
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,599
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.</font>

133
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know now?</font>

134
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:45,040
<font color=#FFFF00>You threw up in his arms
during the orientation.</font>

135
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi So, I recommend you spending
this semester as quiet as possible.</font>

136
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's start our first class.</font>

137
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't it so funny?</font>

138
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't Borg's mom scary?</font>

139
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,179
<font color=#FFFF00>She should know by now.</font>

140
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,089
<font color=#FFFF00>How could she look so calm?</font>

141
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,660
<font color=#FFFF00>She feels different from
all of the other moms.</font>

142
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,329
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

143
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:37,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Her poker face gives me goosebumps.</font>

144
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,170
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop.
- She wants us to stop for today.</font>

145
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Are we done already?</font>

146
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,339
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a hard time.
My neck became stiff.</font>

147
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

148
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Do Hye has to change alone.</font>

149
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

150
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,189
<font color=#FFFF00>She never shows us her naked body.</font>

151
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,760
<font color=#FFFF00>She's too mystic.</font>

152
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Fields have eyes,</font>

153
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,929
<font color=#FFFF00>and woods have ears.</font>

154
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,059
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

155
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:17,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Fields have eyes,
and woods have ears.</font>

156
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,609
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful what you talk about.</font>

157
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,839
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here.</font>

158
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. Fencing.</font>

159
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
<font color=#FFFF00>This is it.</font>

160
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hire a special coach?</font>

161
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Why fencing suddenly?</font>

162
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,890
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

163
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Our kids will enter
elementary school next year.</font>

164
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,329
<font color=#FFFF00>To endure the hardships
of examinations,</font>

165
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,000
<font color=#FFFF00>it's a must to train their physical
and mental strength.</font>

166
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:48,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you know?</font>

167
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Kids learn horse riding
and fencing...</font>

168
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,140
<font color=#FFFF00>before they enter elementary school.</font>

169
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

170
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,540
<font color=#FFFF00>But we don't have time for it.</font>

171
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't cancel her Chinese class.</font>

172
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I cancel her coding class?</font>

173
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Some mothers say that coding classes
aren't essential these days.</font>

174
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:07,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Coding? What is that?</font>

175
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyhow,</font>

176
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,859
<font color=#FFFF00>William can join your group, right?</font>

177
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:16,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Under a condition.</font>

178
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,800
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that?</font>

179
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard his class went home
two hours later than the schedule.</font>

180
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,809
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean Borg's class.</font>

181
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:33,109
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you loud and clear.</font>

182
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you're going to let William
join your fencing class, right?</font>

183
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

184
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,990
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello?
- Ma'am.</font>

185
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,819
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't come to pick up
Borg over two hours.</font>

186
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wondering
if something happened to you.</font>

187
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard his class would be dismissed
two hours later...</font>

188
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,160
<font color=#FFFF00>as it's an extended school day.</font>

189
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, no. That's not true.
Where are you now?</font>

190
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,400
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm in front of your classroom.</font>

191
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,179
<font color=#FFFF00>He just fell asleep
while waiting for you.</font>

192
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,609
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you Mr. Kwon Hyun Bin?
- Yes.</font>

193
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,920
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please sign here.
- Thank you.</font>

194
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,550
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom sent this.</font>

195
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,459
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

196
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on a second.</font>

197
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Borg just fell asleep. I don't think
waking him up now is a good idea.</font>

198
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,780
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance, are you free now?</font>

199
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I don't usually
celebrate my birthdays.</font>

200
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I just had my own birthday party.</font>

201
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't people spend their birthdays
with their family or loved ones?</font>

202
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:32,359
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.
That's what people usually do.</font>

203
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,929
<font color=#FFFF00>But actually,
ever since when I was young,</font>

204
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,199
<font color=#FFFF00>my mom has been working
hard overseas.</font>

205
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,939
<font color=#FFFF00>So living separately has
become the norm for our family.</font>

206
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,969
<font color=#FFFF00>But she never forgets
my birthdays...</font>

207
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,939
<font color=#FFFF00>and makes sure she sends me
a gift every year from afar.</font>

208
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Mom.</font>

209
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,719
<font color=#FFFF00>This year, my mom is giving
me some love as always</font>

210
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,089
<font color=#FFFF00>(Happiness: 50 percent, Longing:
20 percent, Excitement 30 percent)</font>

211
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,530
<font color=#FFFF00>This is too much for me
to finish by myself.</font>

212
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,329
<font color=#FFFF00>But it'd be a shame
if I throw this out,</font>

213
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,770
<font color=#FFFF00>and you have to wait for Borg
to wake up anyway.</font>

214
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday to you</font>

215
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday to you</font>

216
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday, dear Mr. Kwon</font>

217
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:33,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday to you</font>

218
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:37,329
<font color=#FFFF00>You must not.</font>

219
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
<font color=#FFFF00>You must make a wish first
and blow out the candles.</font>

220
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:42,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

221
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday to you, Mr. Kwon.</font>

222
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Now this feels like
a real birthday party.</font>

223
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,720
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, it's my first time
celebrating my birthday...</font>

224
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,690
<font color=#FFFF00>after my seventh birthday.</font>

225
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

226
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,200
<font color=#FFFF00>thanks to you, Borg's mom,</font>

227
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,669
<font color=#FFFF00>this years' birthday will
be unforgettable</font>

228
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,809
<font color=#FFFF00>It would've been nicer
if I prepared a gift for you.</font>

229
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:21,940
<font color=#FFFF00>What a bummer.</font>

230
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Right on.
That's quite disappointing.</font>

231
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I really want a birthday gift
from you.</font>

232
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there anything you want?</font>

233
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I keep that birthday gift
for now?</font>

234
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,720
<font color=#FFFF00>If I happen to think of a gift
I want,</font>

235
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:39,720
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure I tell you about it.</font>

236
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. You can do that.</font>

237
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:44,359
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Shall we eat?
Which dish would you like?</font>

238
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,230
<font color=#FFFF00>This is...</font>

239
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Bulgogi made with Korean beef
from Hoengseong, Gangwon Province.</font>

240
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Sushi with the best sea urchin roe
from Hokkaido.</font>

241
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Caviar salad with the caviar
from Russia.</font>

242
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,409
<font color=#FFFF00>And you have an octopus dish
from Muan which gives life...</font>

243
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:57,940
<font color=#FFFF00>into a dying cow.</font>

244
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's my respect.
You have great eyes.</font>

245
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:02,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Dig in, ma'am.</font>

246
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:11,490
<font color=#FFFF00>You must eat sushi with your hands
to avoid messing up the form...</font>

247
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,329
<font color=#FFFF00>and dip the raw fish
into the soy sauce, not the rice...</font>

248
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,129
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to enjoy the real taste
of the ingredient.</font>

249
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,440
<font color=#FFFF00>And this.</font>

250
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,859
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ma'am, please have some.
- Okay.</font>

251
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

252
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Borg, you're up.</font>

253
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Join us. This is really good.</font>

254
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Yool, which one would you like?</font>

255
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:57,770
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a man.</font>

256
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,379
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

257
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,649
<font color=#FFFF00>(Happy birthday, Mr. Kwon, the
sunshine of Buckingham Preschool)</font>

258
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,669
<font color=#FFFF00>Unbelievable.</font>

259
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,609
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she reject me?</font>

260
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah Reum.</font>

261
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't I good enough
for your hot fling?</font>

262
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did I buy this?</font>

263
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me a bottle of soju.</font>

264
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,530
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, no. We're packed now.
- Darn it.</font>

265
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on. Excuse me.
Please share your table with him.</font>

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:22:59,800
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take a seat right there.
- Okay.</font>

267
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me. Please share the table.</font>

268
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,440
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you sit
at the same table, you trash?</font>

269
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:10,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Me?</font>

270
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,050
<font color=#FFFF00>You're from Cola Girls.</font>

271
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,050
<font color=#FFFF00>It is you.</font>

272
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you the weasel from upstairs?</font>

273
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me be upfront with you.</font>

274
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:30,399
<font color=#FFFF00>We've met a long time ago,
haven't we?</font>

275
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, seriously? Are you going
to bring that up again, weasel?</font>

276
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:36,069
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, I'm so sick of you.</font>

277
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. You know each other?</font>

278
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,609
<font color=#FFFF00>What a destiny. This is good.</font>

279
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Share the table. I'll throw in...</font>

280
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,879
<font color=#FFFF00>a bottle of soju
and stir-fried eels for free.</font>

281
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, you're quick-witted.</font>

282
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I'm so nice.</font>

283
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,190
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

284
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:59,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I waited for him so long.</font>

285
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Me too. I waited for her so long.</font>

286
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,700
<font color=#FFFF00>It happened to you too?</font>

287
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I even...</font>

288
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,639
<font color=#FFFF00>prepared a gift for her.</font>

289
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,639
<font color=#FFFF00>So did I.</font>

290
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't these pretty?</font>

291
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:24,550
<font color=#FFFF00>They're great.</font>

292
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't these awesome?</font>

293
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,960
<font color=#FFFF00>They are awesome.</font>

294
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,700
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't even wear them because
they're for men. I'll throw them...</font>

295
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do it!</font>

296
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me that.
In exchange, I'll give you these.</font>

297
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Put it on.</font>

298
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:02,089
<font color=#FFFF00>- This looks nice.
- You look great in it.</font>

299
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,960
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. We should drink to this.
Here you go.</font>

300
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

301
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!</font>

302
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are those two here?</font>

303
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know them?</font>

304
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:42,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

305
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,030
<font color=#FFFF00>One of them is my neighbor, and
the other one is almost like family.</font>

306
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,369
<font color=#FFFF00>Then please take them with you.</font>

307
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:50,500
<font color=#FFFF00>They got drunk
and were making a scene.</font>

308
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of them, the other
customers are about to leave.</font>

309
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:55,309
<font color=#FFFF00>In that case,</font>

310
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:58,240
<font color=#FFFF00>can I borrow this for one more day?</font>

311
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:03,919
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

312
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Come back to me.</font>

313
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:29,309
<font color=#FFFF00>How can someone be this drunk?</font>

314
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,510
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a similar disgraceful behavior
as yours yesterday.</font>

315
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,379
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough. What about Yool?</font>

316
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:38,280
<font color=#FFFF00>He's in REM sleep...</font>

317
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,980
<font color=#FFFF00>after I read
"Red Riding Hood" to him.</font>

318
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:44,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Go Bong?</font>

319
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:49,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I really need to do it tonight.</font>

320
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,730
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

321
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Do what?</font>

322
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:55,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't...</font>

323
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:59,270
<font color=#FFFF00>stand it anymore.</font>

324
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:03,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm about to burst.</font>

325
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand it anymore...</font>

326
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,059
<font color=#FFFF00>seeing your condition.</font>

327
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

328
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too urgent.</font>

329
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:31,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't close your eyes.</font>

330
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at me.</font>

331
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll open it up for you now.</font>

332
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, please be careful.</font>

333
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Go Bong.</font>

334
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:58,559
<font color=#FFFF00>(Fingerprint recognition complete)</font>

335
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,470
<font color=#FFFF00>(Pupil recognition complete)</font>

336
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:04,599
<font color=#FFFF00>The food waste disposal is open.</font>

337
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,309
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

338
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,419
<font color=#FFFF00>You ate a lot.</font>

339
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,619
<font color=#FFFF00>It's completely filled.</font>

340
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:30,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

341
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,669
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

342
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,510
<font color=#FFFF00>The disposal of the food waste
inside the body is complete.</font>

343
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,480
<font color=#FFFF00>The residue is 0 percent.</font>
