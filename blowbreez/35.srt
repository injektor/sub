00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:15,562
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim Mi-poong, what is this money?</font>

3
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,923
<font color="yellow">I don't know.
I don't know what that money is!</font>

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,148
<font color="yellow">Isn't this your drawer?</font>

5
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,609
<font color="yellow">It is, but I don't know anything
about that money.</font>

6
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,406
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it!</font>

7
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,898
<font color="yellow">We're going to confiscate this as evidence.</font>

8
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:41,775
<font color="yellow">Please follow us to the audit
room for further investigation.</font>

9
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:43,774
<font color="yellow">I'll take her.</font>

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,452
<font color="yellow">Fine. Please bring her to the audit room.</font>

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

12
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:09,305
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

13
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,664
<font color="yellow">Cash was found in Kim Mi-poong's drawer?</font>

14
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:14,492
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

15
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:16,846
<font color="yellow">$300,000 was found.</font>

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,625
<font color="yellow">We are currently investigating her past and
the process of the leakage of information.</font>

17
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:26,613
<font color="yellow">However, she keeps denying it,
so it'll take some time.</font>

18
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:30,133
<font color="yellow">Leaking company information is unacceptable.</font>

19
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:34,449
<font color="yellow">Make sure you thoroughly investigate this
to find out how the design was disclosed.</font>

20
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:35,992
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

21
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:46,250
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee Jang-go?</font>

22
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:49,494
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

23
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,093
<font color="yellow">Oh, he works as a lawyer in
Winner Group's legal investigation team.</font>

24
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,672
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

25
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:58,914
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

26
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,149
<font color="yellow">Just recently.</font>

27
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,570
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,476
<font color="yellow">But he's Kim Mi-poong's husband.</font>

29
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,827
<font color="yellow">Will he be part of this investigation?</font>

30
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:17,481
<font color="yellow">Of course not. As the rules state, families
cannot be involved in the investigations.</font>

31
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,709
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han. Ms. Park.</font>

32
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:24,426
<font color="yellow">I am Kim Mi-poong's husband, but I am
also part of the investigation team.</font>

33
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,945
<font color="yellow">I have the confidence to be
as objective as possible.</font>

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,961
<font color="yellow">Please let me be a part of it.</font>

35
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:32,055
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, please abide by the rules.</font>

36
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:35,264
<font color="yellow">You can't help but be subjective
to your family members.</font>

37
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:40,739
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han, make sure Mr. Lee
can't be part of this investigation.</font>

38
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,641
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am.</font>

39
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,641
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

40
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,968
<font color="yellow">Please allow me to at least
speak to Kim Mi-poong.</font>

41
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,008
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee.</font>

42
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,100
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

43
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,309
<font color="yellow">How can Mi-poong's husband be
working in our investigation team?</font>

44
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:20,480
<font color="yellow">However, no matter what he does,
she won't be able to get out of this one.</font>

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,484
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened.</font>

46
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:30,776
<font color="yellow">I don't know how the apparels I designed were</font>

47
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:34,560
<font color="yellow">released as the products
of our rival company.</font>

48
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:39,545
<font color="yellow">I don't know why such a large amount
of money was in my drawer either.</font>

49
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,688
<font color="yellow">What happens to me now?</font>

50
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,545
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong. Kim Mi-poong.</font>

51
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,569
<font color="yellow">Look into my eyes. Focus here.</font>

52
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,278
<font color="yellow">You can't become weak-hearted.</font>

53
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,051
<font color="yellow">Get your head together, got it?</font>

54
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,673
<font color="yellow">Did anyone approach you lately?</font>

55
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:06,299
<font color="yellow">Did anyone ask you to hand over the design?</font>

56
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,163
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

57
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,216
<font color="yellow">I never saw or met anyone.</font>

58
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,210
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

59
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:17,719
<font color="yellow">Then when was the last time
you opened that drawer?</font>

60
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,639
<font color="yellow">Yesterday.</font>

61
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:22,097
<font color="yellow">There wasn't any money in it yesterday.</font>

62
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:24,452
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

63
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:25,733
<font color="yellow">I'm sure.</font>

64
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,672
<font color="yellow">That means this happened last night.</font>

65
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,506
<font color="yellow">I don't know why this happened to me.</font>

66
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:37,289
<font color="yellow">I feel like my heart is going to burst.</font>

67
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,784
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm going to find out
who did this to you.</font>

68
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:45,449
<font color="yellow">You didn't do this,
so the truth will be revealed.</font>

69
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:47,613
<font color="yellow">So don't worry.</font>

70
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,709
<font color="yellow">But that's not what's important right now.</font>

71
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:54,781
<font color="yellow">I don't care what happens to me,
but the apparels</font>

72
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,725
<font color="yellow">I made were supposed
to be released next week.</font>

73
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:01,413
<font color="yellow">But the apparels that were made
in the factory are useless now.</font>

74
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:03,028
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

75
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:06,707
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

76
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:20,701
<font color="yellow">Grandma, this, too.</font>

77
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,558
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

78
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,151
<font color="yellow">We almost forgot the fly swatter.</font>

79
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,267
<font color="yellow">Yes, we almost left this
important thing behind.</font>

80
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:30,277
<font color="yellow">Good job, Yoo-sung.</font>

81
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:41,589
<font color="yellow">- It seems like you're almost done packing.
- Yes, I'm almost done.</font>

82
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:46,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I couldn't even help
you out. You worked hard.</font>

83
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:49,898
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine. I don't have a lot of things.</font>

84
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:53,171
<font color="yellow">Until a few days ago,
we had a party together.</font>

85
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,730
<font color="yellow">I was happy that we were
finally getting along.</font>

86
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:00,470
<font color="yellow">You're moving away out of the blue.</font>

87
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:05,082
<font color="yellow">I feel so upset and guilty.</font>

88
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:10,951
<font color="yellow">No ma'am. I should be the sorry one.
Thank you for everything.</font>

89
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,248
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Mi-poong.</font>

90
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:18,066
<font color="yellow">I'll treat her like she's
my own granddaughter.</font>

91
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,175
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

92
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:28,199
<font color="yellow">Oh, my handsome Yoo-sung.</font>

93
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,418
<font color="yellow">I'm going to miss you
so much. What will I do?</font>

94
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,965
<font color="yellow">Your aunt lives here,
so come visit her often.</font>

95
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,465
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

96
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:45,395
<font color="yellow">Take this and buy something yummy.</font>

97
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma. Thank you.</font>

98
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,595
<font color="yellow">You're so precious.</font>

99
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,879
<font color="yellow">- Should we take these out?
- Yes, please.</font>

100
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,790
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's wrong? Did someone die?</font>

101
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,261
<font color="yellow">Don't say such nonsense!</font>

102
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:15,704
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo is really moving away.</font>

103
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,995
<font color="yellow">- They're moving out their things right now.
- Really? Right now?</font>

104
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,770
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil,</font>

105
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,933
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is right.</font>

106
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,403
<font color="yellow">What's not right?</font>

107
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:34,027
<font color="yellow">About Ms. Joo. I feel terrible about this.</font>

108
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:37,682
<font color="yellow">Aside from everything else,
you shouldn't send her away like</font>

109
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,150
<font color="yellow">you're kicking her out of here.
Don't you think that's wrong?</font>

110
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:46,389
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, how about we stop
them from moving right now?</font>

111
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,347
<font color="yellow">Mother, why are you saying this now?</font>

112
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:54,545
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you feel, but
I feel like a load is off my mind.</font>

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,090
<font color="yellow">Now that they're finally moving out,
I feel like my toothache is gone.</font>

114
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,777
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

115
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:03,066
<font color="yellow">How could you be so cruel?</font>

116
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,957
<font color="yellow">The three of them came down
from North Korea together.</font>

117
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:09,194
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's right that
you tear them apart?</font>

118
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,863
<font color="yellow">Especially in this frigid weather?</font>

119
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:16,416
<font color="yellow">Mother, we didn't tear their family apart.</font>

120
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:21,183
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong left her family behind
to get married to Jang-go.</font>

121
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:25,409
<font color="yellow">And they lived for free
in that house until now.</font>

122
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:30,285
<font color="yellow">We did as much as we could,
so we don't have to feel terrible at all.</font>

123
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:35,373
<font color="yellow">And even if we beg that woman to stay, do you</font>

124
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,403
<font color="yellow">think she'll be able to out of embarrassment?</font>

125
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,669
<font color="yellow">If she has a conscience,
she wouldn't be able to live here.</font>

126
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,302
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

127
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:46,638
<font color="yellow">No matter how much she needed a man.
No matter how much there was no man around.</font>

128
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:50,397
<font color="yellow">Because I'm so ashamed
of what she did, I can't even</font>

129
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:54,101
<font color="yellow">go out and I'm stuck here
preparing the bean sprouts.</font>

130
00:08:54,521 --> 00:09:00,310
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Geum-sil.
Ms. Joo said that isn't true.</font>

131
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:04,176
<font color="yellow">It's not that big of a deal to like someone.</font>

132
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,490
<font color="yellow">If she did like him, she would've said so.</font>

133
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,232
<font color="yellow">She said it isn't true because it isn't true.</font>

134
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:16,843
<font color="yellow">And I don't think she's the type
to steal another woman's man.</font>

135
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:19,154
<font color="yellow">So let's believe her.</font>

136
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,271
<font color="yellow">You go ahead and believe her.</font>

137
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:24,655
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see that woman ever again.</font>

138
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:29,737
<font color="yellow">How dare you call
your in-law "that woman!"</font>

139
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,669
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn your
manners from? How ignorant!</font>

140
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:35,775
<font color="yellow">Stop it. You lost.</font>

141
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:39,185
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

142
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,505
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Grandma. It seems like
Yoo-sung's family is moving away.</font>

143
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:47,490
<font color="yellow">There's a moving truck outside.</font>

144
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:57,221
<font color="yellow">- Is this the last one?
- Yes.</font>

145
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,318
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's that ring.</font>

146
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,981
<font color="yellow">But why is this here?</font>

147
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,412
<font color="yellow">The ring was here.</font>

148
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,974
<font color="yellow">How did this happen?</font>

149
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,792
<font color="yellow">I thought I had lost this ring.</font>

150
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:27,794
<font color="yellow">I guess it was under
the wardrobe all this time.</font>

151
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,318
<font color="yellow">Is that your ring?</font>

152
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:36,206
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is my ring.
I was so upset when I had lost it.</font>

153
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:40,830
<font color="yellow">Because we're moving,
I was able to find this ring.</font>

154
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:46,863
<font color="yellow">But I think I saw a ring like this before.</font>

155
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:50,207
<font color="yellow">Of course you did because I was wearing it.</font>

156
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:55,089
<font color="yellow">You did something great today.</font>

157
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,232
<font color="yellow">You found this precious ring for me.</font>

158
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,970
<font color="yellow">We're done. Should we go?</font>

159
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,458
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

160
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,382
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Yoo-sung.</font>

161
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:16,099
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything. Good-bye.</font>

162
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:20,317
<font color="yellow">- Hurry and get in the car. The driver is waiting.
- Okay.</font>

163
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,115
<font color="yellow">- Go safely.
- Bye, Yoo-sung.</font>

164
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,387
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

165
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:40,779
<font color="yellow">You're right. I don't feel right
since they're leaving like this.</font>

166
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:45,551
<font color="yellow">I know. Mi-poong will feel really sad when
she comes home and sees the empty house.</font>

167
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:48,612
<font color="yellow">People feel sad even when
a dog runs away from home.</font>

168
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:51,732
<font color="yellow">But she doesn't even
come out to say good-bye?</font>

169
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,710
<font color="yellow">Just ignore it.</font>

170
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,021
<font color="yellow">You're going to make it noisy.
I'm going to work.</font>

171
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,810
<font color="yellow">- Me, too, grandma.
- Let's go.</font>

172
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:07,537
<font color="yellow">What will she do with
little Yoo-sung on her own?</font>

173
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:17,172
<font color="yellow">Grandma, are you happy
that you found the ring?</font>

174
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,896
<font color="yellow">Of course I am.</font>

175
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:22,767
<font color="yellow">This is the ring that
your grandfather gave</font>

176
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,312
<font color="yellow">your grandmother when
they separated from each other.</font>

177
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,821
<font color="yellow">I see. It really is a precious ring.</font>

178
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,179
<font color="yellow">I should call your aunt and let her know.</font>

179
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,140
<font color="yellow">She'll be so surprised.</font>

180
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:41,395
<font color="yellow">The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</font>

181
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,669
<font color="yellow">Maybe she's busy.
She's not answering her phone.</font>

182
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,482
<font color="yellow">It's the same one.</font>

183
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:51,545
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

184
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:53,827
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

185
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,357
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung.</font>

186
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:03,487
<font color="yellow">From now on, only you
and I will be living together.</font>

187
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:10,335
<font color="yellow">Now that we found your grandfather's ring,
let's be strong and live well.</font>

188
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,870
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

189
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,269
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim Mi-poong.</font>

190
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,362

00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:24,144
<font color="yellow">Is the boss here?</font>

198
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:25,606
<font color="yellow">My boss?</font>

199
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:28,535
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for him?</font>

200
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

201
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,441
<font color="yellow">You have a guest.</font>

202
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,184
<font color="yellow">Shin Jung-mi?</font>

203
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:36,184
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hello.</font>

204
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,559
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

205
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:38,887
<font color="yellow">Who...?</font>

206
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,035
<font color="yellow">She's here for an interview.</font>

207
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:43,754
<font color="yellow">An interview?</font>

208
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,109
<font color="yellow">Continue what you were doing.</font>

209
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:48,426
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

210
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,199
<font color="yellow">Here's my resume.</font>

211
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:01,446
<font color="yellow">You were born in 1990. Your age...?</font>

212
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:03,847
<font color="yellow">- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven?</font>

213
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,461
<font color="yellow">You're very young.</font>

214
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,379
<font color="yellow">Young customers do come to our store,
but there will mostly be elderly ones.</font>

215
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:13,249
<font color="yellow">Will you be able to talk to them?</font>

216
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:14,974
<font color="yellow">It's not a problem.</font>

217
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:19,070
<font color="yellow">As you can tell from my resume,
I have a lot of experience selling things.</font>

218
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:25,035
<font color="yellow">Clothing stores in malls, health supplements,
cosmetics, and etcetera.</font>

219
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,410
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of experience
selling things, so I can do a great job.</font>

220
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:31,714
<font color="yellow">How long is the distance
from here to your house?</font>

221
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,910
<font color="yellow">It's about two bus stops away.
It's pretty close.</font>

222
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:39,070
<font color="yellow">You're perfect for my store.</font>

223
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:41,574
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

224
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,300
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me while I answer this call.</font>

225
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,417
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

226
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:55,410
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Is it nice working here?</font>

227
00:15:56,754 --> 00:16:01,418
<font color="yellow">If it was, why would I quit? Wouldn't
there be a reason why I want to quit?</font>

228
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:04,152
<font color="yellow">What's the reason?</font>

229
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,408
<font color="yellow">It's my first time meeting you today,
but I'm telling you this</font>

230
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,874
<font color="yellow">because you seem like a nice woman.</font>

231
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,371
<font color="yellow">Don't work here.</font>

232
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:19,925
<font color="yellow">The boss is really weird!</font>

233
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:21,777
<font color="yellow">He's weird?</font>

234
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:24,144
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

235
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:27,293
<font color="yellow">How can I explain this?</font>

236
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,511
<font color="yellow">He's very picky.</font>

237
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:35,006
<font color="yellow">For example, he asked me how
many customers came here, so I</font>

238
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:39,004
<font color="yellow">told him there were about ten.
He got extremely ticked off!</font>

239
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:43,496
<font color="yellow">He asked me,
"Is it nine people? Ten? Eleven?"</font>

240
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:44,699
<font color="yellow">What the heck?</font>

241
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,222
<font color="yellow">He's really weird.</font>

242
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,793
<font color="yellow">Right? His motto is, "Let's not live dully."</font>

243
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,168
<font color="yellow">"Let's not live dully?"</font>

244
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,847
<font color="yellow">So weird!</font>

245
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:58,574
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

246
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,386
<font color="yellow">He gives you a hard time for your outfits!</font>

247
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:03,774
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

248
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:08,736
<font color="yellow">I can put up with everything but people
who nag you about your clothes!</font>

249
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:10,691
<font color="yellow">So what if he's the boss?</font>

250
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,949
<font color="yellow">Why else would I want to quit?</font>

251
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,605
<font color="yellow">On top of that, he has mysophobia.</font>

252
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:18,435
<font color="yellow">Miss, make sure you think well
before you make a decision.</font>

253
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,777
<font color="yellow">But if I were you, I wouldn't work here.</font>

254
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:27,347
<font color="yellow">Shin Jung-mi, you can start working tomorrow.</font>

255
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,175
<font color="yellow">Sir, I can't work here!</font>

256
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:31,926
<font color="yellow">Good-bye!</font>

257
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,621
<font color="yellow">Shin Jung-mi!</font>

258
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,535
<font color="yellow">Did you say something strange to her?</font>

259
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,363
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that?</font>

260
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:51,881
<font color="yellow">This won't do.
Since you're having a hard time</font>

261
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,777
<font color="yellow">hiring someone,
I should continue working here.</font>

262
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:56,558
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

263
00:17:56,996 --> 00:17:58,863
<font color="yellow">Don't you understand Korean?</font>

264
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,971
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work here for your sake.</font>

265
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:07,457
<font color="yellow">Please move, sir.</font>

266
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,269
<font color="yellow">So this company bought the
sportswear design legally?</font>

267
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:22,422
<font color="yellow">Yes. We used  legal means to buy
this design. Is there a problem?</font>

268
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,153
<font color="yellow">Who was the one who sold this design?</font>

269
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:29,847
<font color="yellow">Mr. James Kang from
a company called K Design.</font>

270
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,008
<font color="yellow">Mr. James Kang from K Design?</font>

271
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,964
<font color="yellow">Where is he right now?</font>

272
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

273
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:41,167
<font color="yellow">He might be somewhere in the Philippines.</font>

274
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,021
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but can I have
his contact information?</font>

275
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,384
<font color="yellow">His phone number is in my office.
I'll text it to you.</font>

276
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:49,731
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

277
00:18:58,895 --> 00:18:59,895
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

278
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:02,824
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

279
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,191
<font color="yellow">What did you need to tell me urgently?</font>

280
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:14,452
<font color="yellow">There's another crucial evidence that shows
Kim Mi-poong did leak the information.</font>

281
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:18,136
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Crucial evidence?</font>

282
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:21,688
<font color="yellow">Through her e-mails, we were able to find out</font>

283
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:24,508
<font color="yellow">she did hand over the plan to James Kang.</font>

284
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,059
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

285
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,476
<font color="yellow">Something has gone wrong.</font>

286
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:32,496
<font color="yellow">She's not that kind of person.
Someone is blaming her for this.</font>

287
00:19:32,949 --> 00:19:34,634
<font color="yellow">You want to believe that's the case.</font>

288
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,386
<font color="yellow">It's not that I don't
understand how you feel.</font>

289
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:41,410
<font color="yellow">This is why I said you shouldn't
be a part of this case.</font>

290
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,636
<font color="yellow">You should stay out of this now.</font>

291
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:45,386
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han...</font>

292
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,472
<font color="yellow">It's my order as your team leader.</font>

293
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:52,685
<font color="yellow">From this point on, you will not
be able take part in this case.</font>

294
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,360
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

295
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:18,394
<font color="yellow">Why is there no video file
for this day and time only?</font>

296
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:20,980
<font color="yellow">The CCTV was broken that day.</font>

297
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,246
<font color="yellow">We tried to restore it the next day,
but we weren't able to restore that time.</font>

298
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:27,432
<font color="yellow">It was deleted?</font>

299
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:29,465
<font color="yellow">Rather than being deleted,</font>

300
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:35,003
<font color="yellow">it could have been broken or
someone could have damaged it.</font>

301
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:36,839
<font color="yellow">It would be impossible to check.</font>

302
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:41,058
<font color="yellow">How could that happen?
How can be so careless?</font>

303
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,707
<font color="yellow">I have no excuse to offer.</font>

304
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:52,049
<font color="yellow">However, if someone purposely deleted it, the</font>

305
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,777
<font color="yellow">one who would be responsible is Kim Mi-poong.</font>

306
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:56,731
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

307
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,583
<font color="yellow">It's true. The one who leaked the information</font>

308
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,188
<font color="yellow">would be the one to delete the video file.</font>

309
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:06,316
<font color="yellow">I'll call you if we can restore it.
Please leave now.</font>

310
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,394
<font color="yellow">We need to get back to work.</font>

311
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,628
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see the videos
from the past week to now.</font>

312
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,690
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim.
- Yes.</font>

313
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:19,448
<font color="yellow">- Show the videos to Mr. Lee.
- Yes, sir.</font>

314
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:33,504
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

315
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:39,605
<font color="yellow">Money was found in Kim Mi-poong's desk drawer,
and the e-mails were confirmed, too?</font>

316
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:43,891
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather. That's what
the investigation team found out.</font>

317
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,636
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

318
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,463
<font color="yellow">Did Mi-poong really do that?</font>

319
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:51,875
<font color="yellow">This happened at the last stage
of the sportswear production,</font>

320
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,158
<font color="yellow">so we suffered a great loss.</font>

321
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,970
<font color="yellow">Maybe there's a misunderstanding,
just like that box incident last time.</font>

322
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:04,369
<font color="yellow">I wanted to trust her
because of what happened</font>

323
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:08,009
<font color="yellow">last time, but the
evidence is clear this time.</font>

324
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,390
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I should do either.</font>

325
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:16,329
<font color="yellow">How could this happen? I saw her
positively because she saved me.</font>

326
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:19,247
<font color="yellow">Her mother is the same way.</font>

327
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,276
<font color="yellow">Did I misjudge their characters?</font>

328
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:27,604
<font color="yellow">I don't know why these things keep happening.</font>

329
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:32,954
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, I didn't want to tell you this.</font>

330
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,811
<font color="yellow">What is it? Tell me.</font>

331
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,245
<font color="yellow">To be honest, Ms. Joo
and Mi-poong had a bad habit</font>

332
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,290
<font color="yellow">of stealing when they had been in China.</font>

333
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:45,538
<font color="yellow">They would date any men they pleased.</font>

334
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:46,767
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

335
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:49,248
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

336
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:50,689
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

337
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,543
<font color="yellow">There was the incident with father, too.</font>

338
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,733
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should let them
off the hook anymore.</font>

339
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,939
<font color="yellow">Fire Kim Mi-poong immediately.</font>

340
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,376
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

341
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:17,052
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what will you do?</font>

342
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:21,327
<font color="yellow">The truth will be revealed one day.</font>

343
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,071
<font color="yellow">We believe you. You know that, don't you?</font>

344
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:29,444
<font color="yellow">That's right. We believe you.</font>

345
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:31,346
<font color="yellow">You have to come back, Mi-poong.</font>

346
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:34,955
<font color="yellow">We'll be waiting for you.
Keep in touch. Okay?</font>

347
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:36,673
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

348
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:45,641
<font color="yellow"><i>Following the silent road,</i></font>

349
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:51,647
<font color="yellow"><i>I wonder where I am</i></font>

350
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:58,421
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't see anything</i></font>

351
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:05,528
<font color="yellow"><i>So I'm getting afraid</i></font>

352
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:14,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Sometimes, I feel alone</i></font>

353
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:20,910
<font color="yellow"><i>I feel like I'll continue to be alone</i></font>

354
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:27,984
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm going without change</i></font>

355
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:34,323
<font color="yellow"><i>Tell me I'm close, to go a little more</i></font>

356
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:39,462
<font color="yellow"><i>I hear it</i></font>

357
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:55,056
<font color="yellow">Thank you. If you're able to
recover the file, let me know.</font>

358
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:56,345
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

359
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:25,150
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han, Kim Mi-poong isn't inside the
audit room. Is the investigation over?</font>

360
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,743
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear?</font>

361
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:33,720
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong was fired,
so she was sent home for now.</font>

362
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,141
<font color="yellow">Pardon? She was fired?</font>

363
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:58,051
<font color="yellow">What? Is he going to the
chairman's office right now?</font>

364
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:00,843
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

365
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:03,108
<font color="yellow">It was unfair for Kim Mi-poong
to be dismissed.</font>

366
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,272
<font color="yellow">Please revoke your decision.</font>

367
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:14,029
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong's dismissal was decided
according to the company regulations.</font>

368
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:16,406
<font color="yellow">There's something suspicious about this.</font>

369
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,858
<font color="yellow">The CCTV was broken during that time.</font>

370
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:22,224
<font color="yellow">And even if she did leak the design,
does it make sense</font>

371
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,474
<font color="yellow">for her to keep the money in her desk drawer?</font>

372
00:26:25,726 --> 00:26:28,632
<font color="yellow">What you're saying right now
are all assumptions!</font>

373
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:34,332
<font color="yellow">Don't bring me assumptions. Bring me
clear evidence that I can believe in.</font>

374
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:36,435
<font color="yellow">Don't just bring me words!</font>

375
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,046
<font color="yellow">Then I'll take care of her dismissal.</font>

376
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,876
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim!
- Mr. Lee!</font>

377
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,225
<font color="yellow">What are you doing using
your emotions like this?</font>

378
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:58,507
<font color="yellow">Then hand this case over to the
police for a public investigation.</font>

379
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:01,335
<font color="yellow">What? A public investigation?</font>

380
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:04,002
<font color="yellow">That can't happen.</font>

381
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:08,405
<font color="yellow">If this is revealed to the public,
our brand name will be stained.</font>

382
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,199
<font color="yellow">We have enough losses already.</font>

383
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:15,363
<font color="yellow">If people find out the products we are
hurriedly preparing right now are substitutes,</font>

384
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,587
<font color="yellow">Winner's Group will suffer a great blow.</font>

385
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:24,210
<font color="yellow">So you'll just let a hard-working
employee be fired with false charges?</font>

386
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:25,749
<font color="yellow">False charges?</font>

387
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:29,609
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying all the evidence found so</font>

388
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,985
<font color="yellow">far has been used by someone to set her up?</font>

389
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:34,054
<font color="yellow">Who would do such a thing?</font>

390
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:36,866
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

391
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:40,617
<font color="yellow">If she really has been falsely charged, bring</font>

392
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:43,765
<font color="yellow">the evidence, just like the chairman said.</font>

393
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:45,921
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

394
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:09,096
<font color="yellow">There was enough investigation.</font>

395
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:12,733
<font color="yellow">The money was found and
the e-mails were confirmed.</font>

396
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,970
<font color="yellow">What more do you need?</font>

397
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,975
<font color="yellow">I was trying to solve this
in a sensible manner.</font>

398
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:21,629
<font color="yellow">Sensible manner?</font>

399
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:25,772
<font color="yellow">Have you considered how much
we suffered because of this incident?</font>

400
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:29,555
<font color="yellow">How will you compensate for
the loss in a sensible manner?</font>

401
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:31,950
<font color="yellow">Tell me as Kim Mi-poong's husband.</font>

402
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:37,447
<font color="yellow">I had to beg the chairman in
order not to demand</font>

403
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:40,484
<font color="yellow">a compensation for the
great loss from Kim Mi-poong.</font>

404
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:43,185
<font color="yellow">So you should end this now.</font>

405
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:49,874
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

406
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:55,039
<font color="yellow">You have been hired to
work for Winner's Group.</font>

407
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:59,397
<font color="yellow">Before you defend your family,
you should consider the company first.</font>

408
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:02,733
<font color="yellow">If you don't like that, you should leave.</font>

409
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,976
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong!</font>

410
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:39,999
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

411
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,910
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer your phone?</font>

412
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,463
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I didn't know
I had run out of battery.</font>

413
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,203
<font color="yellow">You're frozen. You should have
gone in somewhere. It's cold.</font>

414
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:01,018
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to take that box and
go inside a place with a lot of people.</font>

415
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:03,851
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

416
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:11,450
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I thought I had lived a good
life without being mean to anybody.</font>

417
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:14,778
<font color="yellow">I have no idea why this is happening to me.</font>

418
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:19,245
<font color="yellow">If I had really done something wrong,</font>

419
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,179
<font color="yellow">I would gladly be punished,
but this is really unfair!</font>

420
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,475
<font color="yellow">I'm so shocked that
my heart is beating fast.</font>

421
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:31,427
<font color="yellow">I'll return you to your place. I'll make
sure to reveal that it's not your fault.</font>

422
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:33,617
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

423
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,686
<font color="yellow">But what do I tell the family?</font>

424
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:44,850
<font color="yellow">Mother will say something if she finds out.</font>

425
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,311
<font color="yellow">And what do I tell my mom?</font>

426
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,999
<font color="yellow">My mom will be so upset
if she finds out I was fired.</font>

427
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,593
<font color="yellow">For now, let's not tell anyone.</font>

428
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,031
<font color="yellow">I'll do something about this in the meantime.</font>

429
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:05,651
<font color="yellow">Then what do I do tomorrow?</font>

430
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,359
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow...</font>

431
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:12,890
<font color="yellow">Just leave the house with me
as if you're going to work.</font>

432
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,550
<font color="yellow">You can go to the movies,
bookstore, and museum.</font>

433
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,159
<font color="yellow">You can have some alone time.</font>

434
00:31:20,184 --> 00:31:22,184
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it,
it sounds like a good idea.</font>

435
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:26,421
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

436
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:28,148
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

437
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:31,475
<font color="yellow">We're a married couple.
And what are married couples?</font>

438
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:33,012
<font color="yellow">One body and soul.</font>

439
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,413
<font color="yellow">You're so smart.</font>

440
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:38,116
<font color="yellow">Let's go now.</font>

441
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,531
<font color="yellow">Go where?</font>

442
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:41,968
<font color="yellow">Look at you. Wake up.</font>

443
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:46,445
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to your mother's new home?
- That's right! She moved today!</font>

444
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,373
<font color="yellow">I wasn't in my right mind.</font>

445
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:50,965
<font color="yellow">Are you in your right mind now?</font>

446
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,381
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you need to come
to your senses. Okay?</font>

447
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:56,781
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

448
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:16,929
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

449
00:32:16,954 --> 00:32:19,287
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, can you tell that I cried?</font>

450
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:21,817
<font color="yellow">No. You look pretty.</font>

451
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:23,179
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

452
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:27,382
<font color="yellow">My mom can always tell whenever I cried.</font>

453
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:29,554
<font color="yellow">I can't get caught.</font>

454
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,155
<font color="yellow">Do you think it'll be okay
if I smile like this?</font>

455
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,921
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

456
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:36,303
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

457
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,921
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

458
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,146
<font color="yellow">Mom! Yoo-sung!</font>

459
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,639
<font color="yellow">Mother! Yoo-sung, I bought pork feet!</font>

460
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:49,015
<font color="yellow">- Aunt! Uncle!
- Welcome! It's cold outside, isn't it?</font>

461
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:50,454
<font color="yellow">- Sit here.
- Okay.</font>

462
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,796
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

463
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,810
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll move you to a bigger,
better house in the future.</font>

464
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:09,215
<font color="yellow">Thank you. This house is
enough for Yoo-sung and me.</font>

465
00:33:09,812 --> 00:33:11,604
<font color="yellow">The house is warm.</font>

466
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:13,827
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's totally warm.</font>

467
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:16,132
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

468
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:17,601
<font color="yellow">Mom, here.</font>

469
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:22,702
<font color="yellow">Is this toilet paper? You bought
exactly what we needed.</font>

470
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,692
<font color="yellow">In South Korea, you buy
toilet paper for people who</font>

471
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:28,433
<font color="yellow">just moved in so that things
will go smoothly for them.</font>

472
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:32,686
<font color="yellow">Really? I think things are
going smoothly for me already.</font>

473
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:35,147
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

474
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:38,062
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this ring?</font>

475
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:42,749
<font color="yellow">I found it under the wardrobe
while I was moving out.</font>

476
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:45,554
<font color="yellow">Didn't you lose this when you were mugged?</font>

477
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:47,233
<font color="yellow">It's so strange.</font>

478
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:50,399
<font color="yellow">I never took this ring off before.</font>

479
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,436
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was so happy after I found this ring!</font>

480
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:59,288
<font color="yellow">Mom, I think things will go
smoothly for you from now on.</font>

481
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:03,193
<font color="yellow">If I had known this would have happened,
I would've moved out a long time ago.</font>

482
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:06,155
<font color="yellow">After moving here, I feel so relaxed.</font>

483
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:10,314
<font color="yellow">This feels like a palace to me.</font>

484
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:14,487
<font color="yellow">If you're relaxed and happy, I'm happy, too.</font>

485
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:18,800
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't worry
about Yoo-sung and me, and</font>

486
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:22,853
<font color="yellow">just live a happy life with
Jang-go and your in-laws.</font>

487
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,445
<font color="yellow">I have no more wishes other than that.</font>

488
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,684
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

489
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,411
<font color="yellow">But when are we going to eat pork feet?</font>

490
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:34,294
<font color="yellow">How about now?</font>

491
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:38,372
<font color="yellow">Mother, did you eat yet?</font>

492
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

493
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:44,186
<font color="yellow">Are you serious? Mi-poong was fired?</font>

494
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,114
<font color="yellow">Yes, mother, so don't worry anymore.</font>

495
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:52,301
<font color="yellow">But what if she's able to come back again?</font>

496
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:56,640
<font color="yellow">That won't happen this time.
Grandfather fired her himself.</font>

497
00:34:57,177 --> 00:35:00,356
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! How could this happen?</font>

498
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:04,653
<font color="yellow">Oh my god! She deserves to be fired!</font>

499
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,176
<font color="yellow">How could she-</font>

500
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:09,340
<font color="yellow">How dare she hang up on me!</font>

501
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:12,838
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear! I shouldn't be like this!</font>

502
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:17,481
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil! Hwang Geum-sil!</font>

503
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:20,405
<font color="yellow">What is she doing here at this hour?</font>

504
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:23,589
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil!</font>

505
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:26,525
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did your husband
cause trouble again?</font>

506
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:29,501
<font color="yellow">My in-law doesn't live here anymore.
She moved out.</font>

507
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:33,103
<font color="yellow">So I hope you won't
come here for her anymore.</font>

508
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:34,816
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

509
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,908
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

510
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,075
<font color="yellow">Your daughter-in-law isn't
back from work yet, right?</font>

511
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:45,871
<font color="yellow">Why do you care about my daughter-in-law?</font>

512
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,637
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you this or not?</font>

513
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:50,122
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

514
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,130
<font color="yellow">Rummage through her bedroom.</font>

515
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,981
<font color="yellow">You might find money in there!</font>

516
00:35:57,302 --> 00:35:59,667
<font color="yellow">What are you suddenly talking about?</font>

517
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:01,444
<font color="yellow">What do you mean money?</font>

518
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:04,450
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything.</font>

519
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:08,477
<font color="yellow">Your daughter-in-law got caught for leaking</font>

520
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:12,036
<font color="yellow">company information and getting money for it!</font>

521
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,930
<font color="yellow">$300,000 came out from her desk!</font>

522
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,497
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

523
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:20,559
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong was fired.</font>

524
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,051
<font color="yellow">What will you do, Geum-sil?</font>

525
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,263
<font color="yellow">Is everything you said true?</font>

526
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:30,813
<font color="yellow">Would I have come
all the way here if it wasn't?</font>

527
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:35,590
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong made the company suffer
thousands of dollars in losses!</font>

528
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:40,560
<font color="yellow">So she's supposed to go to prison right now,</font>

529
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:45,012
<font color="yellow">but my daughter-in-law begged the
chairman not to go that far.</font>

530
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:46,981
<font color="yellow">Prison?</font>

531
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:50,950
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for Shin-ae, Mi-poong
would be in big trouble by now!</font>

532
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,552
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong was supposed to have paid
out of her pocket to pay for the damage.</font>

533
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:58,873
<font color="yellow">If she couldn't do that, then your son
would've had to clean up the mess for her!</font>

534
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,130
<font color="yellow">Even if you had sold this house, you wouldn't
have been able to pay for everything.</font>

535
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,778
<font color="yellow">My son...?</font>

536
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:08,763
<font color="yellow">Oh my god! Geum-sil!</font>

537
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:13,738
<font color="yellow">Oh! What's going on? Geum-sil, what happened?</font>

538
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:18,497
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with her?
- I didn't do anything.</font>

539
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,433
<font color="yellow">- We're back.
- We're back.</font>

540
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,258
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, did you know about this, too?</font>

541
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:34,949
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

542
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:41,097
<font color="yellow">I heard Mi-poong received money
by leaking company information.</font>

543
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:45,316
<font color="yellow">Money was found in your desk drawer.
Is that not true?</font>

544
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:50,368
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, don't try to lie
and tell me the truth.</font>

545
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,839
<font color="yellow">Is that true or not?</font>

546
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:55,981
<font color="yellow">Mom, the thing is...</font>

547
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:59,097
<font color="yellow">it's true that money was found, but...</font>

548
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:03,589
<font color="yellow">It's true. It's true!</font>

549
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,614
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Mother!</font>

550
00:38:04,793 --> 00:38:05,793
<font color="yellow">Move!</font>

551
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:08,493
<font color="yellow">I had my doubts...</font>

552
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,929
<font color="yellow">I didn't think this was true.</font>

553
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,960
<font color="yellow">But you're saying that
everything I heard is true!</font>

554
00:38:14,206 --> 00:38:16,285
<font color="yellow">Mom, calm down and listen to me.</font>

555
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,345
<font color="yellow">Calm down? Listen to you?</font>

556
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:21,855
<font color="yellow">Mother, what do we do?</font>

557
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:25,048
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, what do we do about Jang-go now?</font>

558
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:29,028
<font color="yellow">Tell me! Why did you do that?</font>

559
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,188
<font color="yellow">Who are you trying to ruin?</font>

560
00:38:31,465 --> 00:38:34,416
<font color="yellow">Were you going to give that
money to Jang-go or me?</font>

561
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:36,535
<font color="yellow">Why on earth would you do such a thing?</font>

562
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:39,074
<font color="yellow">What the heck did you do
when you were in North Korea?</font>

563
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:43,487
<font color="yellow">You put on an innocent front.
How can you steal?</font>

564
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:46,261
<font color="yellow">Mother, it's not me. I really didn't do this!</font>

565
00:38:46,598 --> 00:38:50,512
<font color="yellow">I don't know why this happened
to me, but please believe me!</font>

566
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:54,706
<font color="yellow">Money was found in your drawer!
But you still don't know about this?</font>

567
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,324
<font color="yellow">You and your mom are the same!</font>

568
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:01,446
<font color="yellow">Like mother, like daughter.
Both of you commit all</font>

569
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:03,992
<font color="yellow">the wrongdoings and yet
you declare you're innocent.</font>

570
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,309
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

571
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,804
<font color="yellow">Oh, now I see! You were going to
give that money to your mom,</font>

572
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,082
<font color="yellow">weren't you? Were you
going to buy her a house?</font>

573
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:13,002
<font color="yellow">No. I really didn't do it.</font>

574
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:16,482
<font color="yellow">No need to talk this out. Pack your things
and get out of my house.</font>

575
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:23,013
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk with you, so get out!</font>

576
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,496
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Get a hold of yourself, Geum-sil!</font>

577
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,531
<font color="yellow">Mother, I can put up with everything
else but a daughter-in-law like her.</font>

578
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:40,531
<font color="yellow">She's a thief! A con-artist!</font>

579
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:45,551
<font color="yellow">Mother, no matter how poor
I was, I never stole anything!</font>

580
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,536
<font color="yellow">Even if I got extra change,
I couldn't sleep from the guilt</font>

581
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:52,689
<font color="yellow">and had to go give it back in
order to fall asleep well!</font>

582
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,347
<font color="yellow">Yet, you want me to live with
a daughter-in-law like her?</font>

583
00:39:56,707 --> 00:39:59,683
<font color="yellow">Mother, I can't do that even if I die!</font>

584
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:03,949
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. What will we do?</font>

585
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:09,096
<font color="yellow">- Why are you just standing there? Get out!
- Mom!</font>

586
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:10,605
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

587
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,423
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong!
- Where are you going?</font>

588
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:16,621
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do with that thief?</font>

589
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:19,680
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mi-poong said it wasn't true!</font>

590
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:21,931
<font color="yellow">How can you only trust someone else?</font>

591
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,722
<font color="yellow">You're too much.</font>

592
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:29,660
<font color="yellow">Fine! You leave, too!
Leave and never come back again!</font>

593
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:32,456
<font color="yellow">All of you leave! All of you!</font>

594
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,847
<font color="yellow">- I must have lived for too long.
- Mom, what's wrong with you?</font>

595
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:40,605
<font color="yellow">- What do I do?
- Mom, get a hold of yourself!</font>

596
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,207
<font color="yellow">Grandma...</font>

597
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:45,339
<font color="yellow">Massage her.</font>

598
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:49,316
<font color="yellow">- What will we do?
- Mom.</font>

599
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:33,394
<font color="yellow">I can see all the stars tonight.</font>

600
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:40,441
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if Mi-poong
could see those stars, too.</font>

601
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,553
<font color="yellow">She could make a wish, too.</font>

602
00:41:49,644 --> 00:41:50,644
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

603
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:56,477
<font color="yellow">will be all right now, won't she?</font>

604
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:30,605
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

605
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:54,656
<font color="yellow"><i>When I see you, my heart wavers</i></font>

606
00:42:54,656 --> 00:43:01,463
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm just staring at you</i></font>

607
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:04,132
<font color="yellow"><i>It was like that</i></font>

608
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:09,537
<font color="yellow"><i>After loving someone like me,</i></font>

609
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:15,877
<font color="yellow"><i>I became afraid of farewells</i></font>

610
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:22,183
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll think of love simply</i></font>

611
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:27,622
<font color="yellow"><i>I won't regret while living</i></font>

612
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:33,528
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll live like that, I'll simply love</i></font>

613
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,814
<font color="yellow">Mom, what do you think
you're doing right now?</font>

614
00:43:59,176 --> 00:44:02,324
<font color="yellow">You don't listen to me, do you?</font>

615
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,377
<font color="yellow">You want me to eat the food you made?</font>

616
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,228
<font color="yellow">I'd rather starve to death than
eat food made by a thief like you.</font>

617
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:16,926
<font color="yellow">No matter how angry you are,
how could you go this far?</font>

618
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:19,496
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's go.</font>

619
00:44:20,168 --> 00:44:22,452
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, why are you
being like this to mother?</font>

620
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:24,989
<font color="yellow">Mother, I was thoughtless.</font>

621
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:28,182
<font color="yellow">I should have prepared
everything before you came out.</font>

622
00:44:28,691 --> 00:44:30,038
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

623
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:32,351
<font color="yellow">Just get out.</font>

624
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,593
<font color="yellow">Get out. Why aren't you leaving?</font>

625
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:38,953
<font color="yellow">How sickening!</font>

626
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:42,039
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

627
00:44:42,445 --> 00:44:44,507
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be like this!</font>

628
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,134
<font color="yellow">No matter how much you hate her,
you shouldn't turn the table upside down!</font>

629
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:49,890
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one living here?</font>

630
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:56,664
<font color="yellow">- I'm still here, you fool! I'm still alive, you fool!
- Mom, go inside.</font>

631
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:59,507
<font color="yellow">How can she do such a thing?</font>

632
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:20,765
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

633
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:24,259
<font color="yellow">Is my school really near here?</font>

634
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:26,211
<font color="yellow">Of course it is. Let's go.</font>

635
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,343
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms. Hwang.</font>

636
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:42,689
<font color="yellow">Take your daughter right now.</font>

637
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:45,617
<font color="yellow">How can both of you do this?</font>

638
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,909
<font color="yellow">How can she steal?</font>

639
00:45:49,492 --> 00:45:50,492
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

640
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:55,181
<font color="yellow">What do you mean steal?
What are you talking about?</font>

641
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,180
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

642
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,837
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong was fired?</font>

643
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,761
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, where are you going?</font>

644
00:46:06,258 --> 00:46:08,586
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see Director Park Shin-ae.</font>

645
00:46:08,984 --> 00:46:10,390
<font color="yellow">Do you have an appointment?</font>

646
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:14,742
<font color="yellow">No, I don't, but I know her very well.
What floor is her office on?</font>

647
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,078
<font color="yellow">Come on, ma'am.</font>

648
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:19,570
<font color="yellow">You know her very well, but you
don't even know where her office is?</font>

649
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:22,013
<font color="yellow">If you want to see her,
make an appointment first.</font>

650
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:25,332
<font color="yellow">I really do know her very well.
She's not answering her phone.</font>

651
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:30,091
<font color="yellow">So you should get in touch with her first
before you come here. You can't be here.</font>

652
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,799
<font color="yellow">You need to leave. Come back
after you get in touch with her.</font>

653
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,448
<font color="yellow">Young-ju, I'm almost there.</font>

654
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,683
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting in the front.</font>

655
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:41,445
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

656
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:45,376
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong.
- Young-ju.</font>

657
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:48,789
<font color="yellow">Here you go. I took it by accident.</font>

658
00:46:48,814 --> 00:46:51,225
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I was in the
middle of a meeting. Bye.</font>

659
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,648
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

660
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

661
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,250
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

662
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:02,792
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

663
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:07,078
<font color="yellow">You were falsely charged, weren't you?</font>

664
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:09,260
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

665
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:12,429
<font color="yellow">How can I do nothing about it
when you were unjustly fired?</font>

666
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,244
<font color="yellow">I'm going to talk with Shin-ae.</font>

667
00:47:15,524 --> 00:47:18,132
<font color="yellow">I heard she was a director here.</font>

668
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:22,598
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is searching for
evidence right now, so-</font>

669
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:30,386
<font color="yellow">Isn't he the owner of the noodle restaurant?</font>

670
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:38,117
<font color="yellow">Is he Shin-ae's grandfather and
the chairman of this company?</font>

671
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,211
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

672
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:45,219
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

673
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,663
<font color="yellow">Good. I'm glad he's here.
You wait right here.</font>

674
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:50,688
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

675
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,598
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr.Kim.</font>

676
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,833
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

677
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,864
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you about something, so I</font>

678
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:02,942
<font color="yellow">know it's rude, but I came all the way here.</font>

679
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:07,895
<font color="yellow">I know you're busy, but can you
give me some of your time?</font>

680
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:13,442
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, so hurry up and tell me here.</font>

681
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,981
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. Thank you.</font>

682
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:21,419
<font color="yellow">I heard that my daughter was falsely
charged and unjustly fired here.</font>

683
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:24,036
<font color="yellow">I just can't believe that.</font>

684
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:27,684
<font color="yellow">She  isn't that kind of person.</font>

685
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:31,017
<font color="yellow">I have nothing else to say about that matter.</font>

686
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:35,360
<font color="yellow">The evidence is clear.
What is there more to talk about?</font>

687
00:48:35,966 --> 00:48:38,958
<font color="yellow">- You should return home.
- Mr. Kim!</font>

688
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:48,281
<font color="yellow">Please give Mi-poong a chance.</font>

689
00:48:49,044 --> 00:48:50,911
<font color="yellow">She's not that kind of person.</font>

690
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:53,775
<font color="yellow">Please help her with the false accusations.</font>

691
00:48:53,982 --> 00:48:58,101
<font color="yellow">I can't let her live on with
such unfairness. Please, sir!</font>

692
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,184
<font color="yellow">Please help her just this once.</font>

693
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,307
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, those who do
wrong must get punished.</font>

694
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:09,705
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much damage we're
suffering because of your daughter?</font>

695
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:15,124
<font color="yellow">We already helped you enough. You should
be grateful. How can you be so shameful?</font>

696
00:49:16,615 --> 00:49:17,615
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

697
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,505
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard life is, there
are things you can and can't do.</font>

698
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,863
<font color="yellow">You were after another
woman's man's money, and</font>

699
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,583
<font color="yellow">your daughter was after the company's money.</font>

700
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,472
<font color="yellow">How can you live so ruthlessly?</font>

701
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:33,957
<font color="yellow">You should try to live with your efforts.
Where did you learn such rudeness from?</font>

702
00:49:35,615 --> 00:49:38,466
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, what are you talking about?</font>

703
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:44,309
<font color="yellow">For the sake of the hard-working people
who came from up North, live honorably.</font>

704
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,786
<font color="yellow">One bad apple spoils the whole barrel.</font>

705
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:49,286
<font color="yellow">Don't taint other people.</font>

706
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:53,538
<font color="yellow">Make sure this woman can never
hang around the company again.</font>

707
00:49:58,427 --> 00:49:59,427
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

708
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:29,271
<font color="yellow">James Kang.</font>

709
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,216
<font color="yellow">His number is fake.</font>

710
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:34,943
<font color="yellow">This is a perfectly set up conspiracy.</font>

711
00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:40,216
<font color="yellow">But who on earth would want
to do that to Mi-poong and why?</font>

712
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:45,372
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous!</font>

713
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:01,989
<font color="yellow">Faster! Go! Go! Go!</font>

714
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,506
<font color="yellow">Are you having fun?</font>

715
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:15,325
<font color="yellow">Look! Say hi!</font>

716
00:51:18,388 --> 00:51:20,411
<font color="yellow">Don't. You'll fall.</font>

717
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:35,099
<font color="yellow">Hold on tight.</font>

718
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,692
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, how will we send
Yoo-jin back tomorrow?</font>

719
00:51:52,716 --> 00:51:54,967
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about it hurts my heart.</font>

720
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,783
<font color="yellow">I feel the same way.</font>

721
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:01,892
<font color="yellow">How will we be able to
send her back tomorrow?</font>

722
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:09,255
<font color="yellow">We must have become very attached to Yoo-jin.</font>

723
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,239
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so, too.</font>

724
00:52:15,575 --> 00:52:19,775
<font color="yellow">We're having a hard time, so imagine
how sad Yoo-jin will be tomorrow.</font>

725
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:25,411
<font color="yellow">I think I'll cry just thinking about it.</font>

726
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:35,755
<font color="yellow">That's why I was wondering...</font>

727
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:40,571
<font color="yellow">Is there any way we can keep her?</font>

728
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:44,386
<font color="yellow">The orphanage must have rules,
so how can we keep her?</font>

729
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:50,755
<font color="yellow">Unless we officially adopt her...</font>

730
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
<font color="yellow">Adopt her?</font>

731
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:18,083
<font color="yellow">- We're back.
- Welcome back!</font>

732
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:22,575
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, come over here.</font>

733
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,997
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- You're back.</font>

734
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,182
<font color="yellow">- Come here and eat some fruit.
- Have some fruit.</font>

735
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:31,106
<font color="yellow">Did you have fun today?</font>

736
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:33,278
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Really?</font>

737
00:53:34,622 --> 00:53:38,329
<font color="yellow">All of you went to have fun for the last time
before you went back to the orphanage.</font>

738
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:39,887
<font color="yellow">She's going tomorrow, right?</font>

739
00:53:40,115 --> 00:53:41,528
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's going tomorrow.</font>

740
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:50,996
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, when people meet,
they have to separate, too.</font>

741
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:55,549
<font color="yellow">But you can always go
and come back here. Okay?</font>

742
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:57,313
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

743
00:53:57,556 --> 00:54:01,100
<font color="yellow">So you don't have to feel sad at all.</font>

744
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:04,602
<font color="yellow">You can come visit whenever you want to.</font>

745
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,996
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Good.</font>

746
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:12,079
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin.</font>

747
00:54:12,477 --> 00:54:15,659
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-jin, what's wrong?
- Maybe she ate the wrong food outside.</font>

748
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:17,517
<font color="yellow">Give her some plum tea.</font>

749
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:19,891
<font color="yellow">My stomach hurts!</font>

750
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:25,407
<font color="yellow">My stomach hurts!</font>

751
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,432
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, what's wrong
with you all of a sudden?</font>

752
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:35,303
<font color="yellow">- We're taking her to the hospital.
- Okay.</font>

753
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:38,773
<font color="yellow">Go on.
- What's wrong with her?</font>

754
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,333
<font color="yellow">She had fun, so what's wrong
with her all of a sudden?</font>

755
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:46,452
<font color="yellow">My goodness! Taking care of kids is a hassle!</font>

756
00:54:46,477 --> 00:54:50,750
<font color="yellow">Of course! It even takes a lot
of work to take care of a dog.</font>

757
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:11,847
<font color="yellow">There isn't any internal problem with her.</font>

758
00:55:12,628 --> 00:55:13,628
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

759
00:55:14,137 --> 00:55:16,259
<font color="yellow">Then what's wrong with her?
She had a fever and</font>

760
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:18,449
<font color="yellow">broke into a cold sweat.
She was in so much pain.</font>

761
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,690
<font color="yellow">Was she ever stressed recently?</font>

762
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:23,566
<font color="yellow">Stressed?</font>

763
00:55:23,683 --> 00:55:28,433
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, kids pretend to be sick
so that they don't have to go to school.</font>

764
00:55:28,879 --> 00:55:31,931
<font color="yellow">Often times, when that happens,
they get a fever and feel pain.</font>

765
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:37,269
<font color="yellow">In my opinion, she's like this
because of psychological factors.</font>

766
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,667
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin must not have wanted to
return to the orphanage tomorrow.</font>

767
00:55:57,176 --> 00:55:58,243
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

768
00:55:59,613 --> 00:56:02,769
<font color="yellow">She must not have really wanted to
go back if she became sick like this.</font>

769
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:07,394
<font color="yellow">This makes me more upset than if
she would have gotten cut or scraped.</font>

770
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:09,801
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong...</font>

771
00:56:13,613 --> 00:56:14,613
<font color="yellow">thank you.</font>

772
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,199
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms. Hwang.</font>

773
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:45,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

774
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,933
<font color="yellow">I told you to take your daughter,
so why aren't you coming?</font>

775
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:52,191
<font color="yellow">Must I pack her belongings with my own hands?</font>

776
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,136
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to send them through mail?</font>

777
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:07,388
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, what are you doing?</font>

778
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:08,982
<font color="yellow">You stay out of this.</font>

779
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:15,066
<font color="yellow">Take these and leave.</font>

780
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,620
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang, you're being too harsh.
How can you go this far?</font>

781
00:57:22,535 --> 00:57:24,468
<font color="yellow">Think about this in my shoes.</font>

782
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:28,180
<font color="yellow">If you were in my shoes,
you would've done the same thing.</font>

783
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:32,535
<font color="yellow">I can put up with everything but a thief.</font>

784
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:36,152
<font color="yellow">She isn't a thief, Ms. Hwang.
She was falsely accused!</font>

785
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:37,735
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear such words!</font>

786
00:57:39,051 --> 00:57:42,179
<font color="yellow">Because of your daughter,
the entire family was about</font>

787
00:57:42,204 --> 00:57:44,926
<font color="yellow">to live on the streets
in the middle of winter!</font>

788
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:48,583
<font color="yellow">Because of the compensation
for the damage she caused!</font>

789
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:53,714
<font color="yellow">How would my son feel at work?</font>

790
00:57:54,629 --> 00:57:56,020
<font color="yellow">Have you ever thought about that?</font>

791
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,253
<font color="yellow">My heart is bleeding right now!</font>

792
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,342
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk with you
anymore, so take these and leave.</font>

793
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:09,712
<font color="yellow">I can't live with a thief
as my daughter-in-law.</font>

794
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:11,386
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang.</font>

795
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:13,276
<font color="yellow">Don't even call my name!</font>

796
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,320
<font color="yellow">I'm done with you.</font>

797
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:17,934
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang.</font>

798
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,198
<font color="yellow">Please think about our kids.</font>

799
00:58:25,596 --> 00:58:28,550
<font color="yellow">They've living nicely together.
This is wrong.</font>

800
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:30,542
<font color="yellow">They'll get hurt.</font>

801
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,480
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang,</font>

802
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:36,370
<font color="yellow">if I'm the problem, I'll cut off my ties with</font>

803
00:58:36,394 --> 00:58:38,810
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, just as I promised to last time.</font>

804
00:58:39,113 --> 00:58:42,433
<font color="yellow">I won't look at her. I won't meet her.
I'll cut off all ties with her.</font>

805
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:46,215
<font color="yellow">So please let her live with Jang-go.</font>

806
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,732
<font color="yellow">Please love her as your daughter-in-law.</font>

807
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:52,886
<font color="yellow">That's all I want, Ms. Hwang.</font>

808
00:58:54,144 --> 00:59:00,369
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you, Ms. Hwang. So please...</font>

809
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:05,401
<font color="yellow">Take these and go! Just go!</font>

810
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,963
<font color="yellow">Why are both of you being so stubborn?</font>

811
00:59:09,988 --> 00:59:12,488
<font color="yellow">- I told you to leave!
- Ms. Hwang.</font>

812
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:19,569
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're here.</font>

813
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,436
<font color="yellow">Take your belongings
and leave with your mother.</font>

814
00:59:22,683 --> 00:59:24,761
<font color="yellow">Please just go!</font>

815
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:28,176
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

816
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:38,136
<font color="yellow">- Mom, let's go.
- Mi-poong...</font>

817
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:41,462
<font color="yellow">I can't do this any longer.</font>

818
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:47,804
<font color="yellow">- No, Mi-poong. You can't do this!
- No!</font>

819
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:49,246
<font color="yellow">I've done enough.</font>

820
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,013
<font color="yellow">We didn't suffer through all
those troubles to live like this.</font>

821
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:01,308
<font color="yellow">Father wouldn't want me to live like this.</font>

822
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:02,699
<font color="yellow">So let's go.</font>

823
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:06,635
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, mother.</font>

824
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,667
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, Aunt Nam-yi.</font>

825
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:13,058
<font color="yellow">Please tell grandmother that I'm sorry.</font>

826
01:00:20,957 --> 01:00:23,168
<font color="yellow">- Let's go!
- Mi-poong!</font>

827
01:00:24,551 --> 01:00:25,551
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

828
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,074
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil! My goodness!</font>

829
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,328
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk.
- Let's go.</font>

830
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:30,319
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong left home. It's late, but
you should learn to move on now.</font>

831
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:32,141
<font color="yellow">Mom, you really-!</font>

832
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:36,597
<font color="yellow">If you want to go after her, go ahead.</font>

833
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:41,214
<font color="yellow">However, I can't accept her as
my daughter-in-law anymore.</font>

834
01:01:43,683 --> 01:01:44,683
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

835
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:46,758
<font color="yellow">I'll leave, too.</font>

836
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:12,581
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mi-poong. Where are you right now?</font>

837
01:02:24,816 --> 01:02:25,816
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

838
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,671
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask of you.</font>

839
01:02:31,262 --> 01:02:32,729
<font color="yellow">You must do it for me.</font>

840
01:02:37,832 --> 01:02:38,832
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

841
01:02:44,068 --> 01:02:47,990
<font color="yellow">Let's... get a divorce.</font>

842
01:02:51,162 --> 01:02:52,162
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

843
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,565
<font color="yellow"><i>The wind, the sunlight, the memories</i></font>

844
01:03:05,565 --> 01:03:13,273
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't forget the beautiful days</i></font>

845
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:14,933
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

846
01:03:15,177 --> 01:03:18,747
<font color="yellow">I hate you. I hate everyone.
I hate even looking at you now!</font>

847
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:21,484
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't send me back there.
Don't tell me to go.</font>

848
01:03:21,787 --> 01:03:24,342
<font color="yellow">You don't have to go.
The three of us can live together.</font>

849
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,792
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

850
01:03:25,818 --> 01:03:28,741
<font color="yellow">You just have to say one
warm word of apology to her.</font>

851
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:31,443
<font color="yellow">Make red bean noodles.</font>

852
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:33,280
<font color="yellow">- Red bean noodles?
- Yes.</font>

853
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:35,638
<font color="yellow">I can't digest it. Make pumpkin porridge.</font>

854
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:38,372
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- I'll go!</font>

855
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:40,691
<font color="yellow">Use your words!</font>

856
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,548
<font color="yellow">- You're going to own this one day.
- Me?</font>

857
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:44,573
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

858
01:03:44,598 --> 01:03:46,265
<font color="yellow">Have you found my father?</font>

859
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:47,966
<font color="yellow">Your father?</font>
