<font color="yellow">- (Episode 10)
- I must find Soon-ok no matter what.</font>

3
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:16,320
<font color="yellow">I have to find her! There's no time!</font>

4
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,132
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. You were in the
middle of a conversation.</font>

5
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:35,585
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

6
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:41,078
<font color="yellow">You're the young grandma
I met last time.</font>

7
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:45,102
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hello.</font>

8
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:48,421
<font color="yellow">Starting from today,
she'll be working at our restaurant.</font>

9
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,398
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that so?</font>

10
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:51,969
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

11
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:58,384
<font color="yellow">We troubled you last time and
didn't even get to thank you until now.</font>

12
00:00:58,523 --> 00:00:59,523
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

13
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,586
<font color="yellow">Things turned out well.
We'll see each other often now.</font>

14
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:04,918
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll do my best.</font>

15
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,148
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,203
<font color="yellow">There are many people like her
who came from North Korea.</font>

17
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,975
<font color="yellow">If Soon-ok is alive...</font>

18
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,376
<font color="yellow">wouldn't I be able to bring her?</font>

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,742
<font color="yellow">Of course, Elder.</font>

20
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,922
<font color="yellow">So you must take care of your health.</font>

21
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:30,953
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

22
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:32,734
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

23
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,133
<font color="yellow">It won't change?
But it's going to change soon.</font>

24
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,875
<font color="yellow">How can it change when
there's something stuck on you?</font>

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,969
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there a problem?</font>

26
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:43,757
<font color="yellow">What's stuck on us?</font>

27
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,969
<font color="yellow">Forget it! Let's go!</font>

28
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:48,140
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Let's go!</font>

29
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:49,193
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Come out!</font>

30
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:50,218
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

31
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:53,154
<font color="yellow">You'll be wasting a lot of your time!</font>

32
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:59,770
<font color="yellow">Mom, wait! Did you just hear her say
that we'll be wasting a lot of our time?</font>

33
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:02,201
<font color="yellow">She's a quack! A con-artist!</font>

34
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:07,598
<font color="yellow">She's being ill-tempered because we paid
fifty dollars instead of a hundred dollars!</font>

35
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:08,623
<font color="yellow">No, mom.</font>

36
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,078
<font color="yellow">I suddenly feel anxious.</font>

37
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:13,644
<font color="yellow">I think something is wrong.</font>

38
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:18,150
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? What can go wrong?</font>

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,828
<font color="yellow">It's strange.</font>

40
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:25,237
<font color="yellow">The entire family's last name has to change,
so all of us should know about it.</font>

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,322
<font color="yellow">Why hasn't anyone told us
anything yet though?</font>

42
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,482
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

43
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,337
<font color="yellow">This won't do, mom.</font>

44
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:35,387
<font color="yellow">I need to check it out myself.</font>

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,320
<font color="yellow">Mom, go home first.</font>

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

47
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,313
<font color="yellow">What if she gets in
trouble again? Hey! Hey!</font>

48
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,484
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

49
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:47,407
<font color="yellow">Where is my husband?</font>

50
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:48,994
<font color="yellow">He's in his office.</font>

51
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,166
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,847
<font color="yellow">She's Mr. Jo's wife.</font>

53
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

54
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,188
<font color="yellow">Please hurry up.</font>

55
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,368
<font color="yellow">And please find a trustworthy
broker in China for me.</font>

56
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:04,891
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your help.</font>

57
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:06,595
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

58
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:08,634
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

59
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,188
<font color="yellow">What did you come here for?</font>

60
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:12,680
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by.</font>

61
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
<font color="yellow">What about father?</font>

62
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:17,962
<font color="yellow">He had an appointment, so he went out.
Why are you looking for him?</font>

63
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,373
<font color="yellow">Are you here to throw another fit?</font>

64
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,456
<font color="yellow">If you do something
like that again, I'll just-</font>

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,653
<font color="yellow">You'll just what? Divorce me?</font>

66
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,708
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die than get a divorce.</font>

67
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:33,560
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll throw a fit
at you only from now on.</font>

68
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:34,585
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

69
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,034
<font color="yellow">Stop being cheeky.</font>

70
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,550
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk with you
or see you for now, so get out.</font>

71
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,711
<font color="yellow">He's so narrow-minded!</font>

72
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,728
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jo Dal-ho! Stop being a show-off!</font>

73
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,700
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for father,
I would've dumped you already!</font>

74
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:55,461
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you leaving?</font>

75
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,867
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything to tell me?</font>

76
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:02,103
<font color="yellow">You woman.</font>

77
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:03,751
<font color="yellow">What would I have to tell you?</font>

78
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:07,296
<font color="yellow">Even if there was, I told you
that I don't want to talk with you.</font>

79
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,135
<font color="yellow">Still, even if we have bad
and good times, we've</font>

80
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,030
<font color="yellow">been a married couple
for almost thirty years now.</font>

81
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,573
<font color="yellow">Aren't you being too harsh for me?</font>

82
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,491
<font color="yellow">I'm your wife. Your wife.</font>

83
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:22,887
<font color="yellow">Wife. Spouse. Life companion!</font>

84
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:24,351
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

85
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,074
<font color="yellow">So what if you're my life companion?</font>

86
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:31,017
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you telling your life
companion such an important thing?</font>

87
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,445
<font color="yellow">Tell you what?</font>

88
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:34,745
<font color="yellow">About being adopted as a son!</font>

89
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:40,301
<font color="yellow">If you get adopted as father's son,
you're not the only one who will be effected.</font>

90
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:45,023
<font color="yellow">If you become his son,
then I'll really become his daughter-in-law.</font>

91
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:50,761
<font color="yellow">Our kids will become
Kim Hee-dong and Kim Hee-ra.</font>

92
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,350
<font color="yellow">So why aren't you telling me about it?</font>

93
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,968
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

94
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:57,960
<font color="yellow">Who said that's happening?</font>

95
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,164
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

96
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:04,802
<font color="yellow">I definitely heard him tell you that he wanted
to adopt you as his son in the kitchen!</font>

97
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

98
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,296
<font color="yellow">Did you say no to him?</font>

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
<font color="yellow">I'm busy.</font>

100
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:15,801
<font color="yellow">Did you say no to him? Did you really?</font>

101
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:18,476
<font color="yellow">Why not? Why not?</font>

102
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,924
<font color="yellow">Damn it! What's so important
about being adopted as his son?</font>

103
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:24,132
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem right now!</font>

104
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:26,435
<font color="yellow">Then what is?</font>

105
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,109
<font color="yellow">What's more important than that?</font>

106
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,054
<font color="yellow">Do you know how
I've been living all this time?</font>

107
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,954
<font color="yellow">I tried not to get on his bad side,
so I've been sucking</font>

108
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,388
<font color="yellow">up to him all this time!
It was so difficult for me!</font>

109
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,083
<font color="yellow">So you're saying
you were being nice to him all</font>

110
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:44,203
<font color="yellow">this time because
you wanted his inheritance?</font>

111
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,581
<font color="yellow">Then what about you?</font>

112
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:48,374
<font color="yellow">Can you say you never felt
that way in the tiniest bit?</font>

113
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,108
<font color="yellow">Yes! I never felt that way
in the teensiest bit at all!</font>

114
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,554
<font color="yellow">Can you swear on
your dead father's name?</font>

115
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,019
<font color="yellow">That you never felt
that way in the tiniest bit?</font>

116
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,246
<font color="yellow">Did you already forget?</font>

117
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:01,738
<font color="yellow">When we went bankrupt and had
to go to a motel, Elder came and</font>

118
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:05,692
<font color="yellow">saved us. He did this much for us.
What more do you want from him?</font>

119
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,605
<font color="yellow">You'll get punished for that!</font>

120
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:10,042
<font color="yellow">Fine! I don't mind
getting punished at all!</font>

121
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:13,760
<font color="yellow">I'll bear with all the
punishments, so hurry up and</font>

122
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:16,029
<font color="yellow">go tell him that
you'll be adopted as his son!</font>

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,667
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

124
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:21,890
<font color="yellow">Fine. I know you're
a kind and good person.</font>

125
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:30,168
<font color="yellow">But you can think of me just this once.</font>

126
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:34,274
<font color="yellow">How many times have I told you not
to be greedy for Elder's inheritance?</font>

127
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:38,418
<font color="yellow">If you want to keep
living with me as my wife,</font>

128
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:40,827
<font color="yellow">you better throw those thoughts away. Got it?</font>

129
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:48,160
<font color="yellow">Hey! Jo Dal-ho!</font>

130
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:53,793
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

131
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:55,948
<font color="yellow">You're a jerk!</font>

132
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:58,825
<font color="yellow">You always make me
into a terrible person!</font>

133
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,984
<font color="yellow">Ask anyone on the street if I'm the
terrible person or you're the awful idiot!</font>

134
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:07,098
<font color="yellow">You moron! You fool!</font>

135
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:12,442
<font color="yellow">I should slap you senseless
with rubber gloves on a rainy day!</font>

136
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:16,254
<font color="yellow">I should beat you up!
Left! Right! Upper cut!</font>

137
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:20,329
<font color="yellow">I should punch you and make you
bleed through both your nostrils!</font>

138
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,932
<font color="yellow">You fool!</font>

139
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:23,957
<font color="yellow">Damn you!</font>

140
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,744
<font color="yellow">I feel a lot better.</font>

141
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,745
<font color="yellow">I feel so fresh.</font>

142
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:33,684
<font color="yellow">Take that, you jerk!</font>

143
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,261
<font color="yellow">I should go home and cook.</font>

144
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,809
<font color="yellow">(Leading lady??)</font>

145
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

146
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:57,809
<font color="yellow">You should try dating, Mr. Jo.</font>

147
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:00,145
<font color="yellow">Study women.</font>

148
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,708
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

149
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,403
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

150
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:41,332
<font color="yellow">I'm a webtoon artist.</font>

151
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,861

Of course not.</font>

shouldn't sit together after the age of 7," right?</font>

but Jang-go is trying</font>

he pities your situation.</font>

boundaries though. This isn't right.</font>

there aren't any misunderstandings.</font>

00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:23,546

this either. He'll get angry.</font>

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,138
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

229
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:31,095
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be going now.</font>

230
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:44,595
<font color="yellow">When I talk to her, she doesn't
seem like a strange person.</font>

231
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,834
<font color="yellow">Do I have to tell Geum-sil or not?</font>

<font color="yellow">If she finds out,
she won't let it slide.</font>

233
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,395
<font color="yellow">What? Did she leave?</font>

234
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,359
<font color="yellow">She should have told me she was leaving.</font>

235
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,368

her phone. What's going on?</font>

around my son. It bothers me.</font>

to help poor people in need.</font>

<font color="yellow">the jackpot of your life.
So what are you doing right now?</font>

300
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,127
<font color="yellow">That offer is off the table now.</font>

301
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,276
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

302
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:07,073
<font color="yellow">Mom, Dal-ho said he won't
be adopted as Elder's son.</font>

303
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,261
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

304
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:10,679
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

305
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,659
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's all?</font>

306
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:19,063
<font color="yellow">He's treating me like some thief
who is after the inheritance.</font>

307
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,612
<font color="yellow">Why are you a thief?</font>

308
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,440
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're forcibly
stealing Elder's inheritance.</font>

309
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:30,169
<font color="yellow">This happened because
he didn't have any successors.</font>

310
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:34,202
<font color="yellow">That's why that inheritance
should naturally go to you.</font>

311
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:37,856
<font color="yellow">So how can you be a thief?
Why is that greed? It's not.</font>

312
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:42,674
<font color="yellow">How could Jo Dal-ho
do this to me when he's the</font>

313
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,686
<font color="yellow">only man I have ever
looked up to all my life?</font>

314
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:50,571
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, you have
nothing to worry about.</font>

315
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,431
<font color="yellow">Even if Dal-ho isn't adopted as his son,
that inheritance is bound to be yours.</font>

316
00:20:56,361 --> 00:21:00,447
<font color="yellow">Even if Dal-ho says he won't
receive one penny of it,</font>

317
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:06,369
<font color="yellow">all of that inheritance will
end up in your pocket anyways.</font>

318
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:12,203
<font color="yellow">Watch what happens when it does end up
in my pocket. Jo Dal-ho, you just watch.</font>

319
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:18,242
<font color="yellow">I'm going to pay him back
for hurting me today.</font>

320
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:23,869
<font color="yellow">I won't give him even a penny!</font>

321
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:25,385
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chung-ja.</font>

322
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:32,868
<font color="yellow">Even half a penny is
wasteful on a fool like him.</font>

323
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:36,541
<font color="yellow">Don't give it to him.
Don't give him anything.</font>

324
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,853
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Yes, yes.</font>

325
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:47,178
<font color="yellow">- I'll buy you an apartment.
- All right.</font>

326
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:57,072
<font color="yellow">She's home.</font>

327
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,033
<font color="yellow">The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</font>

328
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:08,809
<font color="yellow">She's not picking up again.</font>

329
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

330
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:47,160
<font color="yellow">You still won't come out?</font>

331
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:02,494
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

332
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:07,398
<font color="yellow">It wasn't anything. It was just a bean.</font>

333
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:09,772
<font color="yellow">A bean?</font>

334
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,033
<font color="yellow">A bean.</font>

335
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:18,964
<font color="yellow">I didn't throw it hard.
You're not hurt, are you?</font>

336
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:21,274
<font color="yellow">How can you throw food?</font>

337
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:25,643
<font color="yellow">Even immature kids don't do something
like that, but an adult like you did?</font>

338
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,408
<font color="yellow">Well, you didn't answer your phone...</font>

339
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,933
<font color="yellow">Same goes for earlier.
Do you know how baffled I was?</font>

340
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:36,407
<font color="yellow">Of course we didn't make a promise,
but we had decided to eat dinner together.</font>

341
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,533
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

342
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:40,665
<font color="yellow">That's why you threw a bean?</font>

343
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:42,744
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

344
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:44,229
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

345
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:46,887
<font color="yellow">you stood me up and
didn't even answer your phone!</font>

346
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,830
<font color="yellow">I deserve to be mad! So I-</font>

347
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,645
<font color="yellow">So you did something so immature?</font>

348
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,180
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong.</font>

349
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:01,955
<font color="yellow">You're mad at me
for something, aren't you?</font>

350
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:05,446
<font color="yellow">What is it? You need to tell me
so that I could know. Tell me.</font>

351
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,103
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

352
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,521
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't throw a bean
at my window to call me out again.</font>

353
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:18,264
<font color="yellow">What would your family members
say if they saw you like this?</font>

354
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:22,558
<font color="yellow">What else would they say? They would
assume that I'm talking to you.</font>

355
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,767
<font color="yellow">Talking isn't a crime.</font>

356
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:30,646
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

357
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:34,516
<font color="yellow">Don't smile at me so sweetly like that.</font>

358
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,632
<font color="yellow">- Aunt.
- Mi-poong, are you home already?</font>

359
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,566
<font color="yellow">My mom and Yoo-sung are home.</font>

360
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:52,387
<font color="yellow">What did I do?
Why is she being so cold to me?</font>

361
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:57,324
<font color="yellow">I don't understand
women's capricious behavior.</font>

362
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,269
<font color="yellow">Why did I have to throw a bean?</font>

363
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,057
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, you messed up today.</font>

364
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,049
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

365
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:17,119
<font color="yellow">These dumplings are
from that noodle restaurant?</font>

366
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:23,287
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mr. Kim gave it to me so that
you and Yoo-sung can eat them.</font>

367
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,436
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat before they get cold.</font>

368
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,671
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, is it good?</font>

369
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:29,576
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is!</font>

370
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,177
<font color="yellow">It's good?</font>

371
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,097
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Mi-poong? Eat up.</font>

372
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:35,909
<font color="yellow">Mom, will you really be okay?</font>

373
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,814
<font color="yellow">Working at a restaurant
will be very hard.</font>

374
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,314
<font color="yellow">It's not hard at all.</font>

375
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,135
<font color="yellow">The noodle bowls aren't heavy either.</font>

376
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:49,723
<font color="yellow">I'm just grateful that
they gave me a job.</font>

377
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:57,969
<font color="yellow">All the workers are very friendly,
and both Mr. Jo and Mr. Kim are very generous.</font>

378
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,651
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work very hard.</font>

379
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:07,513
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'm going to do
my best and make a lot of money.</font>

380
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,839
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

381
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:13,081
<font color="yellow">let's save money and
move out of here quickly.</font>

382
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
<font color="yellow">Okay, mom.</font>

383
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:20,123
<font color="yellow">Grandma and aunt, are we going
to quickly become rich then?</font>

384
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:23,370
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

385
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,456
<font color="yellow">It'll be a while before the maid comes.</font>

386
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:37,239
<font color="yellow">Why are they going to work late today?</font>

387
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:38,542
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

388
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,470
<font color="yellow">It's salty!</font>

389
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:48,356
<font color="yellow">It's so salty! What do I do?</font>

390
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,619
<font color="yellow">It's so bland!</font>

391
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:00,311
<font color="yellow">I need salt!</font>

392
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:04,423
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

393
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:08,572
<font color="yellow">Oh! It'll be done soon!</font>

394
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,955
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and sit down, Mr. Kim.</font>

395
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:15,946
<font color="yellow">Why are you cooking, Ms. Chun?
It must be tiring for you.</font>

396
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:18,841
<font color="yellow">Grandma, where's mom?</font>

397
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:21,463
<font color="yellow">Your mom is very sick.</font>

398
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,165
<font color="yellow">She is?</font>

399
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:25,291
<font color="yellow">She was fine yesterday.</font>

400
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:29,985
<font color="yellow">It's all because of stress.</font>

401
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,540
<font color="yellow">Grandma, the stew is overflowing.</font>

402
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:34,854
<font color="yellow">It's hot!</font>

403
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:37,863
<font color="yellow">My goodness! What do I do?</font>

404
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:39,922
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful!</font>

405
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:45,753
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chun, Dal-ho and I will eat out,</font>

406
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:48,437
<font color="yellow">so don't work too hard.</font>

407
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:51,799
<font color="yellow">No, no! It's almost finished!</font>

408
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:54,602
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, get ready for work and come out.</font>

409
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,355
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye.
- Yes, Elder.</font>

410
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,443
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. It's all done though.</font>

411
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:17,212
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja has fallen ill and is in bed.
Aren't you going to check up on her?</font>

412
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,319
<font color="yellow">Your sweet words
are like medicine to her.</font>

413
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:24,931
<font color="yellow">Why don't you check
on her before you go?</font>

414
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:27,116
<font color="yellow">She's just sick from
drinking too much, so she</font>

415
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:29,087
<font color="yellow">won't feel better just
because I say something.</font>

416
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:31,576
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye.
- The point is that she's sick.</font>

417
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:36,493
<font color="yellow">Why else would have
Chung-ja drank so much?</font>

418
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,243
<font color="yellow">It's all because of you.</font>

419
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:46,367
<font color="yellow">I know there are times
when you don't like Chung-ja.</font>

420
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:54,642
<font color="yellow">But Dal-ho, who will be
next to you when you grow old?</font>

421
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,682
<font color="yellow">Do you think it'll be Elder?</font>

422
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,920
<font color="yellow">Or do you think your kids Hee-dong
and Hee-ra will be there for you?</font>

423
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:04,568
<font color="yellow">That's all crap!</font>

424
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:07,031
<font color="yellow">Nobody knows what
will happen in the future.</font>

425
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:10,656
<font color="yellow">I have an important matter
to attend to, so I'll be leaving now.</font>

426
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:15,822
<font color="yellow">Goodness! That idiot!</font>

427
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:18,735
<font color="yellow">That indifferent fool!
That heartless fool!</font>

428
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,509
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

429
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:26,202
<font color="yellow">"Nobody knows what
will happen in the future?"</font>

430
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,233
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

431
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:36,407
<font color="yellow">Is he saying that he might
not be living with Chung-ja?</font>

432
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:39,833
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Chung-ja! Chung-ja!</font>

433
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:41,353
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

434
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,256
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Chung-ja! Chung-ja!</font>

435
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:48,875
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Chung-ja!
- What is it, mom?</font>

436
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:53,100
<font color="yellow">Are Dal-ho and father worried
about me because they don't see me?</font>

437
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:54,869
<font color="yellow">Worried, my foot!</font>

438
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:59,795
<font color="yellow">I told them you were sick in bed,
and they have no interest whatsoever!</font>

439
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:01,853
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

440
00:30:02,658 --> 00:30:05,322
<font color="yellow">They don't ask where
and how much I'm sick?</font>

441
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,556
<font color="yellow">Nope.</font>

442
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:12,207
<font color="yellow">How did you stay married to
such a heartless man like that?</font>

443
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:19,234
<font color="yellow">Mom, I told you I haven't told you
half the story of how I lived yet.</font>

444
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,237
<font color="yellow">Anyways, stop protesting
and get up. This won't do.</font>

445
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,665
<font color="yellow">I can't do that
because of my hurt pride.</font>

448
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,945
<font color="yellow">I asked Dal-ho who would
stay by his side when</font>

449
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,749
<font color="yellow">he got old, and do you
know what he said?</font>

450
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:43,602
<font color="yellow">He said, "Nobody knows
what will happen in the future."</font>

451
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:45,482
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

452
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:48,577
<font color="yellow">Does that mean
he might not live with me?</font>

453
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,361
<font color="yellow">Yes, it does.</font>

454
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:55,319
<font color="yellow">Your husband is a
gold toad who is going to be</font>

455

Elder's inheritance later on.</font>

456

divorce him, brush it all off and get up.</font>

your gold toad hops off to another woman?</font>

Not even one of them is alive.</font>

It's so sad that it makes me tear up.</font>

yesterday, weren't you?</font>

554
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,315
<font color="yellow">Was it because I threw a bean at you?</font>

555
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:44,774
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was mad because
you threw a bean at me.</font>

556
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

you'll get punished after you die.</font>

567
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:22,985

Why are you being like this again?</font>

584
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:34,714
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

585
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:38,839
<font color="yellow">You usually talk a lot, but you're not
even saying one word right now.</font>

586
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:41,133
<font color="yellow">I'm wondering why
you're acting like this again.</font>

587
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,364
<font color="yellow">Since you're not talking,
it's boring. Say something.</font>

588
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:51,475
<font color="yellow">Am I a chatterbox that yaps my head off
anytime so that you won't get bored?</font>

589
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:52,741
<font color="yellow">You're doing it again!</font>

590
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:54,402
<font color="yellow">You're being aggressive again!</font>

591

like this since yesterday?</font>

592
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,402

You're happy then angry.</font>

593

<font color="yellow">I don't know how to keep up
with your capricious behavior.</font>

00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:07,099
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this?</font>

595
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:10,323
<font color="yellow">We had a good time eating
spicy rice cakes. So what's wrong?</font>

596
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:12,366
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

597
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:16,268
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying I'm doing
this for no reason at all?</font>

598
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,597
<font color="yellow">Tell me what's wrong so that I can know.</font>

599
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,378
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

600
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:22,753
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

601
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,261
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

602
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:29,353
<font color="yellow">Do you still see me as the little tadpole
who used to go to school with you in Macau?</font>

603
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,767
<font color="yellow">You treat me like a little kid.</font>

604
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,758
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong!</font>

605
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:36,156
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me!</font>

606
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,674
<font color="yellow">What would your mom and
aunt say if they saw you like this?</font>

607
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:44,972
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

608
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:49,068
<font color="yellow">We had a good time eating
spicy rice cakes, so what's wrong?</font>

609
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,204
<font color="yellow">I really don't know.</font>

610
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,464
<font color="yellow">Is she your girlfriend?</font>

611
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:16,867
<font color="yellow">Huh? No way!
She's like my little sister.</font>

612
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:25,989
<font color="yellow">To Jang-go, I'm not a woman.
I'm just his friend's little sister.</font>

613
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:32,656
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is being good to me and helping
me out because he feels pitiful for me.</font>

614
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,382
<font color="yellow">I was confused.</font>

615
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:41,684
<font color="yellow">Jang-go wasn't the fool. I was.</font>

616
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:48,192
<font color="yellow">I'll put my feelings away for Jang-go
while he doesn't realize them.</font>

617
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:52,792
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

618
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:23,773
<font color="yellow">I should have at least asked
for her phone number then.</font>

619
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,790
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Ma'am, that's the grandson of that old</font>

620
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,336
<font color="yellow">man with the 100 million
dollar inheritance, right?</font>

621
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

622
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:34,559
<font color="yellow">- He is!
- He is!</font>

623
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:37,974
<font color="yellow">But why does his rich grandson
always go around like that?</font>

624
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:41,231
<font color="yellow">He always wears sweatpants
and eats cup ramen.</font>

625
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:43,439
<font color="yellow">Who cares when he's wealthy?</font>

626
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:48,050
<font color="yellow">It must be because he's wealthy.
Doesn't he still look cool?</font>

627
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:51,620
<font color="yellow">I guess. He has 100 million dollars,
so who cares?</font>

628
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:07,297
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, what do you mean by that? The grandson
with a 100 million dollar inheritance?</font>

629
00:44:08,683 --> 00:44:13,529
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about that young man
eating ramen in front of the convenience store?</font>

630
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:16,666
<font color="yellow">Yes, everyone in this neighborhood
knows that he's the grandson</font>

631
00:44:16,691 --> 00:44:20,073
<font color="yellow">- of that old man with a
100 million dollar inheritance.
- Nobody doesn't know that.</font>

632
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,268
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

633
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:41,809
<font color="yellow">(Webtoon artist: Jo Hee-dong)</font>

634
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:45,721
<font color="yellow">He's the grandson with a
100 million dollar inheritance?</font>

635
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,050
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

636
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:04,573
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

637
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,868
<font color="yellow">Is this Mr. Jo Hee-dong?</font>

638
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:08,716
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Jo Hee-dong.</font>

639
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:13,144
<font color="yellow">Are you...?</font>

640
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:17,636
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm the person you gave
your name card to at the</font>

641
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:20,195
<font color="yellow">convenience store last time.
Do you remember me?</font>

642
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:22,369
<font color="yellow">Of course I do!</font>

643
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:28,669
<font color="yellow">I'm interested in experiencing the
modeling work you mentioned last time.</font>

644
00:45:29,152 --> 00:45:30,285
<font color="yellow">Is it still open?</font>

645
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:33,299
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

646
00:45:34,753 --> 00:45:36,940
<font color="yellow">It's still...</font>

647
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:39,472
<font color="yellow">open.</font>

648
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:41,239
<font color="yellow">When should we meet?</font>

649
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,698
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow?</font>

650
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:46,904
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know that place.</font>

651
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:49,858
<font color="yellow">Then I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

652
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:13,040
<font color="yellow">Mother, where's Elder?</font>

653
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:14,566
<font color="yellow">- He's home, right?
- Yes.</font>

654
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:16,636
<font color="yellow">He's in his room.</font>

655
00:46:16,823 --> 00:46:17,823
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

656
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:25,464
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why is he in a rush?</font>

657
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,089
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is dead?</font>

658
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:41,655
<font color="yellow">He died of an illness five years ago.</font>

659
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,498
<font color="yellow">Don't be too disappointed, Elder.</font>

660
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:50,708
<font color="yellow">This is just the beginning.</font>

661
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:52,566
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

662
00:46:54,777 --> 00:47:00,565
<font color="yellow">I can still hear Mr. Kim's voice.</font>

663
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,940
<font color="yellow">I still can't forget it.</font>

664
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,393
<font color="yellow">It's so vivid like it
happened yesterday.</font>

665
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:12,275
<font color="yellow">The day he listed all of
my family members' names...</font>

666
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:16,087
<font color="yellow">and said that they all died.</font>

667
00:47:17,058 --> 00:47:19,721
<font color="yellow">Yes, I feel the same way, Elder.</font>

668
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,086
<font color="yellow">How he had said...</font>

669
00:47:25,683 --> 00:47:28,206
<font color="yellow">that Kim Soon-ok had also died.</font>

670
00:47:31,002 --> 00:47:37,801
<font color="yellow">If he had really lied that
a living person had been dead...</font>

671
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:41,995
<font color="yellow">he would have gone to hell.</font>

672
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,636
<font color="yellow">Since Mr. Kim died,
we can't know if he was</font>

673
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:48,363
<font color="yellow">telling the truth about
your wife's death or not...</font>

674
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,211
<font color="yellow">but this time, we'll find
a trustworthy broker who</font>

675
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,439
<font color="yellow">knows well about the
situation in North Korea...</font>

676
00:47:53,988 --> 00:47:57,416
<font color="yellow">and I'll definitely help
you reunite with her.</font>

677
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:06,688
<font color="yellow">Since you're going out
of your way just for me...</font>

678
00:48:08,808 --> 00:48:11,753
<font color="yellow">I should recover my strength
no matter what.</font>

679
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:13,706
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

680
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:29,307
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you doing here?</font>

681
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,980
<font color="yellow">Are you eavesdropping
on my father-in-law right now?</font>

682
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:42,972
<font color="yellow">As soon as Dal-ho came home,
he rushed into Elder's room.</font>

683
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,464
<font color="yellow">I thought something was weird,
so I eavesdropped, and</font>

684
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:49,362
<font color="yellow">it seems like something
very serious is going on.</font>

685
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:52,268
<font color="yellow">It seemed like he was crying.</font>

686
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,909
<font color="yellow">Crying? My father-in-law?</font>

687
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:56,081
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

688
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:59,589
<font color="yellow">I think they were talking
about someone dying.</font>

689
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,413
<font color="yellow">Why would he cry for
someone's death? There's no</font>

690
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,895
<font color="yellow">one on this planet who
he would cry for like that.</font>

691
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:10,237
<font color="yellow">Maybe someone had
taken a lot of his money!</font>

692
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:11,605
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

693
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:14,018
<font color="yellow">Why is he crying?</font>

694
00:49:14,323 --> 00:49:16,123
<font color="yellow">- It's strange, right?
- Yes.</font>

695
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,159
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

696
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:25,579
<font color="yellow">Are you all right now?</font>

697
00:49:26,392 --> 00:49:28,939
<font color="yellow">Huh? Oh, yes.</font>

698
00:49:29,158 --> 00:49:34,113
<font color="yellow">From now on, she won't
cause any trouble for you,</font>

699
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:37,494
<font color="yellow">and she'll only listen to you.</font>

700
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:40,947
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

701
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:45,639
<font color="yellow">If you're feeling all right, I was hoping
you would make some porridge for Elder.</font>

702
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:50,254
<font color="yellow">Why? Is he suddenly feeling unwell?</font>

703
00:49:50,751 --> 00:49:53,213
<font color="yellow">Something stressful happened to him.</font>

704
00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:56,146
<font color="yellow">What kind of stressful event?</font>

705
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:58,208
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell us?</font>

706
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:01,278
<font color="yellow">It's his personal matter.</font>

707
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:03,822
<font color="yellow">He'll tell you later himself
after it gets solved.</font>

708
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:11,656
<font color="yellow">A personal matter?</font>

709
00:50:13,174 --> 00:50:14,926
<font color="yellow">Perhaps his close friend died.</font>

710
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,382
<font color="yellow">When you get old,
the most hurtful and bitter</font>

711
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:23,206
<font color="yellow">thing is to lose
your friends one by one.</font>

712
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,062
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

713
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:26,958
<font color="yellow">Why are you just standing there?</font>

714
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:29,488
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go make porridge!
You need to</font>

715
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:31,664
<font color="yellow">use this chance to
earn some brownie points!</font>

716
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:32,908
<font color="yellow">Okay, mom.</font>

717
00:50:34,057 --> 00:50:36,952
<font color="yellow">Since there's no chance
of Dal-ho being adopted as</font>

718
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,643
<font color="yellow">his son, I'm just going
to forget all about it.</font>

719
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:43,236
<font color="yellow">Good idea. You don't need
anything else but the gold toad.</font>

720
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:47,222
<font color="yellow">Just take care of your husband
Jo Dal-ho. Do you know what I mean?</font>

721
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:49,611
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

722
00:50:55,728 --> 00:50:58,710
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mom is right.</font>

723
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:01,458
<font color="yellow">The inheritance is the end goal.</font>

724
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:05,600
<font color="yellow">We just have to inherit
father's inheritance no matter what.</font>

725
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:07,619
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

726
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,025
<font color="yellow">Good, good, good.</font>

727
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:14,013
<font color="yellow">What happened to you?</font>

728
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:18,330
<font color="yellow">How can you pathetically be the third wheel
between your friend and her boyfriend?</font>

729
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:23,441
<font color="yellow">Just drink coffee and go home.</font>

730
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,841
<font color="yellow">If they ask you to go watch a movie,</font>

731
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:31,783
<font color="yellow">you better say no.</font>

732
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,220
<font color="yellow">I think I'm so blessed.</font>

733
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:36,964
<font color="yellow">I don't know!</font>

734
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra is here.</font>

735
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,952
<font color="yellow">What an eyesore.</font>

736
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:48,581
<font color="yellow">I need to use the restroom, too.</font>

737
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,855
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Be safe!
- Okay.</font>

738
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:57,994
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to do
that in a public place?</font>

739
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:00,943
<font color="yellow">You two have been touching
each other ever since we met up.</font>

740
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:02,884
<font color="yellow">It's not like you guys
are some seasoned meat.</font>

741
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:04,911
<font color="yellow">I don't know.
He just can't leave me alone.</font>

742
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:08,773
<font color="yellow">He said it's impossible not to touch
the woman he likes when he's next to her.</font>

743
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:12,314
<font color="yellow">He said he likes everything
about me and wants to</font>

744
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:15,805
<font color="yellow">touch me from head to tie.
What am I supposed to do?</font>

745
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,097
<font color="yellow">You little brats...</font>

746
00:52:17,942 --> 00:52:21,464
<font color="yellow">Then you two should just meet up!
What did you call me out for?</font>

747
00:52:22,177 --> 00:52:24,044
<font color="yellow">Don't call me again. Got it?</font>

748
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:26,400
<font color="yellow">You said you were bored to death!</font>

749
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:29,333
<font color="yellow">You were the one who called me
first and wanted to meet up!</font>

750
00:52:37,865 --> 00:52:42,465
<font color="yellow">How could he not call me once
after going to the motel with me twice?</font>

751
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:46,280
<font color="yellow">Am I really not attractive?</font>

752
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:48,516
<font color="yellow">Am I not charming at all?</font>

753
00:52:51,443 --> 00:52:54,685
<font color="yellow">Yes. I need to meet with him myself.</font>

754
00:53:03,271 --> 00:53:04,271
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

755
00:53:06,974 --> 00:53:07,974
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

756
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:10,615
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

757
00:53:12,474 --> 00:53:13,474
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

758
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,091
<font color="yellow">You have something to ask me?
What is it?</font>

759
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:17,669
<font color="yellow">Huh? Hello?</font>

760
00:53:21,943 --> 00:53:23,476
<font color="yellow">What's with this woman?</font>

761
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,263
<font color="yellow">It's like she's playing around with me.</font>

762
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:29,303
<font color="yellow">She always vanishes at the motel.
So what does she need to ask me about?</font>

763
00:53:29,888 --> 00:53:31,896
<font color="yellow">All she does is ignite fire
in a man's heart!</font>

764
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,877
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

765
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,743
<font color="yellow">Darn it! Did Jang-go wear it?</font>

766
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:51,592
<font color="yellow">Grandma! Mom!</font>

767
00:53:54,763 --> 00:53:57,096
<font color="yellow">Grandma, are my tiger
print boxers there?</font>

768
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:59,533
<font color="yellow">- Your tiger print boxers?
- Yes.</font>

769
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:02,478
<font color="yellow">It's right here.
But what do you need it for?</font>

770
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:05,271
<font color="yellow">For something.</font>

771
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:14,689
<font color="yellow">Why is he suddenly looking for
his tiger print boxers at this hour?</font>

772
00:54:17,263 --> 00:54:18,686
<font color="yellow">What did you need to tell me?</font>

773
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:32,318
<font color="yellow">Am I really not attractive? Really?</font>

774
00:54:33,498 --> 00:54:36,353
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

775
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:39,413
<font color="yellow">Am I really not charming
to you as a woman at all?</font>

776
00:54:40,138 --> 00:54:44,871
<font color="yellow">We went to the motel twice, not once.
How could you just leave me alone?</font>

777
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:48,707
<font color="yellow">This was what you wanted to ask me?</font>

778
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:51,680
<font color="yellow">Just answer my question. I need to know.</font>

779
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:53,876
<font color="yellow">Am I really not attractive?</font>

780
00:54:56,341 --> 00:54:57,875
<font color="yellow">No, you are.</font>

781
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,099
<font color="yellow">Then?</font>

782
00:55:00,224 --> 00:55:01,919
<font color="yellow">Then why are you just leaving me alone?</font>

783
00:55:02,763 --> 00:55:05,157
<font color="yellow">Because I want to protect you!
Because I like you!</font>

784
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:11,474
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I'm sorry!</font>

785
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:12,818
<font color="yellow">But wait...</font>

786
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:24,031
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty!</font>

787
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:46,982
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

788
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:48,567
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Jang-soo.</font>

789
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:52,021
<font color="yellow">I'm Jo Hee-ra.</font>

790
00:55:55,771 --> 00:56:00,050
<font color="yellow">Now that we know each other's names,
we know everything about each other.</font>

791
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:14,787
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

792
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,896
<font color="yellow">Get in here.</font>

793
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:38,146
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

794
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:40,341
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

795
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:43,290
<font color="yellow">You didn't come home last night?</font>

796
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:45,521
<font color="yellow">Mommy!</font>

797
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:48,351
<font color="yellow">You're dead!</font>

798
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,872
<font color="yellow">Open the door!</font>

799
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:11,162
<font color="yellow">Mom, quiet down please! If Hee-dong
finds out, he'll beat me to death!</font>

800
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:15,654
<font color="yellow">What? Did you really
cause trouble this time?</font>

801
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:19,067
<font color="yellow">Did you really do something
you deserve a beating for?</font>

802
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:25,555
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't get angry,
and just listen to me.</font>

803
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:28,745
<font color="yellow">Mom, I have a man that I love.</font>

804
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:32,491
<font color="yellow">I was with him until now.
I didn't cause any trouble.</font>

805
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:35,598
<font color="yellow">What? A man that you love?</font>

806
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,181
<font color="yellow">Fine! What does he do for a living?</font>

807
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:45,546
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask him that yet...</font>

808
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:48,424
<font color="yellow">You don't know
what he does for a living?</font>

809
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:49,794
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

810
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:53,809
<font color="yellow">Fine. What family is he from?</font>

811
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:56,983
<font color="yellow">What do his parents do?
Where does he live?</font>

812
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,460
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask him those yet either...</font>

813
00:58:02,341 --> 00:58:06,430
<font color="yellow">What? Then what do you know about him?</font>

814
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:09,685
<font color="yellow">His name.</font>

815
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:11,224
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

816
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:15,361
<font color="yellow">You only know his name,
and yet you slept with him?</font>

817
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,333
<font color="yellow">- You little brat!
- Mom!</font>

818
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:22,138
<font color="yellow">Just die!</font>

819
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:25,708
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

820
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:29,537
<font color="yellow">Just die!</font>

821
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:40,413
<font color="yellow">- Mom, what are you looking at?
- You scared me!</font>

822
00:58:40,748 --> 00:58:42,548
<font color="yellow">Don't creep up on me like that!</font>

823
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:47,592
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for someone? What happened?
Did Jang-soo not come home last night?</font>

824
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:52,224
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. If Geum-sil finds out,
things will get messy.</font>

825
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:55,224
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's not a secret.</font>

826
00:58:55,537 --> 00:58:57,958
<font color="yellow">This isn't the first time
Jang-soo stayed out all night.</font>

827
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:02,579
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know that,
but he stayed out all night the</font>

828
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:06,255
<font color="yellow">other times because
he was practicing his acting.</font>

829
00:59:06,552 --> 00:59:10,023
<font color="yellow">But last night,
I had a weird feeling about it.</font>

830
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:11,918
<font color="yellow">What do you mean a weird feeling?</font>

831
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:15,625
<font color="yellow">Last night, Jang-soo
looked for his tiger print</font>

832
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,438
<font color="yellow">boxers and wore them before he went out.</font>

833
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:20,203
<font color="yellow">Tiger print boxers?</font>

834
00:59:20,632 --> 00:59:23,199
<font color="yellow">Did Jang-soo go out to meet a woman?</font>

835
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:26,573
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm afraid of!</font>

836
00:59:29,474 --> 00:59:30,474
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

837
00:59:32,185 --> 00:59:34,052
<font color="yellow">Why are all of you out here?</font>

838
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,640
<font color="yellow">Were you waiting for me?</font>

839
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:41,247
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, tell us the truth.</font>

840
00:59:41,482 --> 00:59:43,411
<font color="yellow">Where were you last night
and who were you with?</font>

841
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:45,769
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

842
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:49,099
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

843
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:52,606
<font color="yellow">Since things turned out this way already,
I'll just tell you everything.</font>

844
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:55,269
<font color="yellow">Mom. Aunt. Grandma.</font>

845
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:57,439
<font color="yellow">I have a woman I love.</font>

846
00:59:58,107 --> 01:00:00,132
<font color="yellow">That's why I spent last night with her.</font>

847
01:00:00,873 --> 01:00:03,173
<font color="yellow">What? A woman you love?</font>

848
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,813
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, are you
still dating Ms. Song?</font>

849
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:10,396
<font color="yellow">I just told you I have a woman that I love!
Why would you bring Ms. Song up?</font>

850
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:13,841
<font color="yellow">I told you a hundred times that
I don't like a woman who left me behind!</font>

851
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:16,854
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying
you got another girlfriend?</font>

852
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:21,174
<font color="yellow">Yes, mom. She's super cute,
really pretty, and</font>

853
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,035
<font color="yellow">extremely fashionable.
On top of that, she's so nice!</font>

854
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:29,042
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Oh, my head.
I don't know. I don't know.</font>

855
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:31,224
<font color="yellow">I've been shocked enough times now.</font>

856
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:37,234
<font color="yellow">I already saw you date a divorced woman
twelve years younger than you who has kids.</font>

857
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:42,786
<font color="yellow">I have no interest in
your love life whatsoever,</font>

858
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:46,786
<font color="yellow">so live your life however you want to.</font>

859
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:48,083
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

860
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,688
<font color="yellow">You need to know
about the new woman I love!</font>

861
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:53,126
<font color="yellow">You little punk!</font>

862
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:57,561
<font color="yellow">Why are you mouthing off when you didn't
do anything to deserve doing that?</font>

863
01:00:58,809 --> 01:01:00,409
<font color="yellow">We lost. We really lost.</font>

864
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:07,095
<font color="yellow">Aren't aunt and mom being too harsh?</font>

865
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,403
<font color="yellow">You little punk.</font>

866
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:14,282
<font color="yellow">Men need to be careful of three things:</font>

867
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:19,110
<font color="yellow">their mouth, their fist,
and their "down there."</font>

868
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,567
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing?</font>

869
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:25,497
<font color="yellow">If you have complicated women problems,
you'll be humiliating the entire family!</font>

870
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:29,094
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I won't be doing
anything to humiliate</font>

871
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,970
<font color="yellow">the family, so don't you
worry about a thing!</font>

872
01:01:32,861 --> 01:01:34,613
<font color="yellow">Grandma, don't you trust me?</font>

873
01:01:37,142 --> 01:01:38,142
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

874
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,454
<font color="yellow">Who else would I trust besides you?</font>

875
01:01:42,205 --> 01:01:44,252
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I'm serious this time.</font>

876
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:50,755
<font color="yellow">I really found my other half,
so don't worry.</font>

877
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,290
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

878
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:59,277
<font color="yellow">What am I suppose to do with him?</font>

879
01:02:02,275 --> 01:02:04,873
<font color="yellow">You're so cute.</font>

880
01:02:04,898 --> 01:02:09,048
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, will you really be okay
without me and your aunt?</font>

881
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,392
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

882
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:14,267
<font color="yellow">Goodness! You're all grown up!</font>

883
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:16,343
<font color="yellow">You're going camping
with your school now.</font>

884
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,609
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, you really can be good, right?</font>

885
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:21,461
<font color="yellow">Yes, I can!</font>

886
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:24,383
<font color="yellow">But will it really be okay
to send him off alone?</font>

887
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:28,500
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom. All the other
children are going alone, too.</font>

888
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:32,113
<font color="yellow">The teachers will take good care of him,
so don't worry too much.</font>

889
01:02:33,814 --> 01:02:38,397
