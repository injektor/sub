00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:18,318
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, who is this young lady?</font>

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,178
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you. Who is she?</font>

5
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:30,535
<font color="yellow">Is she your girlfriend?</font>

6
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:37,175
<font color="yellow">No. She's the one who moved
into the back house.</font>

7
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:41,764
<font color="yellow">She's the one who moved
into the back house?</font>

8
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,850
<font color="yellow">Did you say you disliked Hee-Ra
because of this young lady?</font>

9
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:49,672
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you talking about?</font>

10
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:52,595
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I was right, wasn't I?</font>

11
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:56,536
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

12
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:01,267
<font color="yellow">You know her, too?</font>

13
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,411
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's the young lady from
North Korea who came to our</font>

14
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,678
<font color="yellow">office because she lost
her security deposit in a scam.</font>

15
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,319
<font color="yellow">Young lady from North Korea?</font>

16
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,390
<font color="yellow">Are you from North Korea?</font>

17
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:15,569
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,170
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

19
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:33,413
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

20
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:37,943
<font color="yellow">what happened?</font>

21
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,243
<font color="yellow">We met before, haven't we?</font>

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,559
<font color="yellow">How can these people be in our house?</font>

23
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,070
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

24
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:09,572
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's going on?</font>

25
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:23,254
<font color="yellow">So what you're saying is that
those people who live</font>

26
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:25,952
<font color="yellow">in the back house are
really from North Korea?</font>

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,777
<font color="yellow">He said they are. Come on, mom.
Were you even listening?</font>

28
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,186
<font color="yellow">Long time ago,
the North Korean boy who fought</font>

29
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:36,717
<font color="yellow">with Jang-go in Macau
is that woman's son.</font>

30
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,579
<font color="yellow">Well, when they lived in Macau, you said
they were a wealthy family with nice cars.</font>

31
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:45,103
<font color="yellow">How did they come down here
as penniless people?</font>

32
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:46,616
<font color="yellow">I'm curious, too.</font>

33
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,589
<font color="yellow">That's not important right now.</font>

34
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,167
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what is your reason
for fooling me and</font>

35
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,464
<font color="yellow">secretly bringing those
people into our house?</font>

36
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,881
<font color="yellow">Are you dating that girl?</font>

37
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:01,522
<font color="yellow">No, mom.</font>

38
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:06,181
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to fool you. I was going
to tell you at the right time.</font>

39
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,732
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell you who
they were, but they really</font>

40
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:12,256
<font color="yellow">are the family of
my friend's younger sister.</font>

41
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,421
<font color="yellow">Friend, my foot! Don't say that!</font>

42
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,428
<font color="yellow">How can you think of bringing those people
into our house? It makes me uncomfortable!</font>

43
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,741
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

44
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,576
<font color="yellow">It does make us uncomfortable.</font>

45
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,023
<font color="yellow">They're from North Korea.</font>

46
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,705
<font color="yellow">We would be lying if we said
we weren't uncomfortable.</font>

47
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:33,102
<font color="yellow">Long time ago, they used to arrest people
for just talking to North Koreans.</font>

48
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:36,859
<font color="yellow">On top of that, we don't know what kind
of things they were doing in North Korea.</font>

49
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:37,884
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

50
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:41,795
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, how can you be so rude
to your grandmother?</font>

51
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,133
<font color="yellow">How dare you raise your voice at her!</font>

52
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,447
<font color="yellow">Yeong-cheol was my friend in Macau.
We studied in the</font>

53
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:58,921
<font color="yellow">same class, exercised together,
and played together.</font>

54
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:07,342
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, I mean Mi-poong, is like a
younger sister who spent those times with us.</font>

55
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:15,592
<font color="yellow">But Yeong-cheol and his father were
killed while they were running away.</font>

56
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:29,155
<font color="yellow">His mother and Mi-poong came to South Korea
with little Yoo-sung but got conned.</font>

57
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:32,873
<font color="yellow">I found out that they were living in
a storage room because they had</font>

58
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,506
<font color="yellow">nowhere else to go, so I couldn't
just let them live like that.</font>

59
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:44,100
<font color="yellow">If our situations had been switched,
Yeong-cheol would have done the same for us.</font>

60
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:52,084
<font color="yellow">So grandma, aunt, and mom...
please understand.</font>

61
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,656
<font color="yellow">How can our situations be switched?</font>

62
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,747
<font color="yellow">North Koreans come to South Korea.
We don't go to North Korea.</font>

63
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,193
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

64
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:08,075
<font color="yellow">Hearing their story,
I do feel bad for them, but...</font>

65
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:11,825
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Why does it have
to be our house of all places?</font>

66
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:26,529
<font color="yellow">I can't believe Mr. Lee was
Yeong-cheol's friend back then.</font>

67
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,128
<font color="yellow">You should have told me!</font>

68
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:33,569
<font color="yellow">I thought you would
get upset if you found out.</font>

69
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:34,983
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

70
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,975
<font color="yellow">How can you be so thoughtless?</font>

71
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,224
<font color="yellow">How can you think of moving in here?</font>

72
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,819
<font color="yellow">I didn't know this was
Jang-go's house either.</font>

73
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:52,191
<font color="yellow">On the day we moved in, when I was
seeing Jang-go off that night, he told me.</font>

74
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,876
<font color="yellow">At first, I thought it was ridiculous, too...</font>

75
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,066
<font color="yellow">but we don't have
anywhere else to go, mom.</font>

76
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:09,248
<font color="yellow">Still, isn't it better staying here
than as homeless people under that bridge?</font>

77
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:14,764
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see that woman
looking down on us earlier?</font>

78
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:20,818
<font color="yellow">It would be more comfortable living
under that bridge than living in this house.</font>

79
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:53,894
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Honey.</font>

80
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:56,006
<font color="yellow">Did you see the way she looked at us?</font>

81
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,640
<font color="yellow">She was looking down on us!</font>

82
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,029
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

83
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,069
<font color="yellow">She was acting
all high and mighty, so why</font>

84
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:09,202
<font color="yellow">did she come to
our house out of all places?</font>

85
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,154
<font color="yellow">I'll go out.</font>

86
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,559
<font color="yellow">Come out. I have something to tell you.</font>

87
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:57,857
<font color="yellow">I was so shocked that I can't be
calmed down even though I ate medicine.</font>

88
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,428
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want to say?</font>

89
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:05,023
<font color="yellow">Goodness. She still thinks
she's a wealthy madam.</font>

90
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,748
<font color="yellow">Stop acting so graceful.</font>

91
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:12,439
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I try to understand you,
I can't. I feel very offended.</font>

92
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,711
<font color="yellow">How can you think of fooling me
and moving into my house?</font>

93
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,369
<font color="yellow">- That's because-
- You didn't know?</font>

94
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,493
<font color="yellow">Don't even try to lie.</font>

95
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:25,853
<font color="yellow">My son's name Lee Jang-go
isn't such a common name.</font>

96
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:28,545
<font color="yellow">You should have known right away
when you heard his name.</font>

97
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,467
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know.</font>

98
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,312
<font color="yellow">I don't really care
whether you knew or not.</font>

99
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,945
<font color="yellow">It seems like my son brought
you and your family</font>

100
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,618
<font color="yellow">here because he felt bad
about your pitiful situation.</font>

101
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:46,588
<font color="yellow">When you can, as soon as possible,
look for another house and move out of here.</font>

102
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:51,851
<font color="yellow">I don't have the slightest desire
to stay in this house either.</font>

103
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,985
<font color="yellow">What... What did you say?</font>

104
00:08:55,905 --> 00:09:00,382
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is that I wouldn't have
come here if I had known this was your house.</font>

105
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,809
<font color="yellow">We had met a nice person
and had a place to go,</font>

106
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:07,993
<font color="yellow">but your son gave us false hope by
claiming there was a house we could</font>

107
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:11,535
<font color="yellow">move into without paying the
security deposit. That's why we came here.</font>

108
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:15,475
<font color="yellow">We'll be getting part of
our security deposit back soon.</font>

109
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:20,344
<font color="yellow">When we get that money,
we'll move out, so don't worry.</font>

110
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:23,165
<font color="yellow">You really mean that, don't you?</font>

111
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,686
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't live here
even if you begged me to.</font>

112
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,529
<font color="yellow">This isn't such an amazing house, so I don't
know why you're acting all important.</font>

113
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,478
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing else to say,
I'll be going in now.</font>

114
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,365
<font color="yellow">How dare she act like that
when she has nothing!</font>

115
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:43,800
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

116
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,348
<font color="yellow">This is so ridiculous!</font>

117
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:50,873
<font color="yellow">How dare she! Oh my goodness!</font>

118
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,381
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

119
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:27,686
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm sorry.</font>

120
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:36,315
<font color="yellow">This wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't been conned.</font>

121
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,084
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

122
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,492
<font color="yellow">No, Mi-poong.</font>

123
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:52,741
<font color="yellow">This all happened because
I wasn't competent enough.</font>

124
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

125
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,639
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

126
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:59,418
<font color="yellow">Let's quickly make money
and get out of this house.</font>

127
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,724
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry up and get out of here.</font>

128
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:10,371
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's okay.
Don't cry. It's okay.</font>

129
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:13,670
<font color="yellow">It's my fault, mom.</font>

130
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:15,551
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Mi-poong.</font>

131
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,287
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

132
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:30,842
<font color="yellow">My Jang-soo. Yes, yes.</font>

133
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,170
<font color="yellow">Good thinking.</font>

134
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:35,970
<font color="yellow">Forget all about Ms. Song</font>

135
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,430
<font color="yellow">Meet your friends and get
some fresh air. All right?</font>

136
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:45,123
<font color="yellow">Keep in mind that if one bus leaves,
another bus will come soon.</font>

137
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,038
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

138
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:49,210
<font color="yellow">Hey, take this money.</font>

139
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,716
<font color="yellow">It's fine, grandma.
You don't have money.</font>

140
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,724
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of money,
so don't you worry.</font>

141
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:00,969
<font color="yellow">He's going to go meet his friend.</font>

142
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:04,392
<font color="yellow">Are you going out looking like that?
Shave that beard immediately!</font>

143
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,373
<font color="yellow">What's so great about being dumped by
a divorcee with kids? My goodness.</font>

144
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:11,264
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

145
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,752
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, aren't you being too harsh?</font>

146
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:22,130
<font color="yellow">If you're going to nag him like that,</font>

147
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,928
<font color="yellow">then do it after you
give him thirty dollars.</font>

148
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,132
<font color="yellow">Don't nag him for free!</font>

149
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:29,756
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

150
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:33,486
<font color="yellow">He went through a big heartbreak.
You won't even comfort</font>

151
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:36,528
<font color="yellow">him, and yet, you're putting
salt over his wounds.</font>

152
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:40,710
<font color="yellow">Is Jang-go your only son
and Jang-soo just a stranger?</font>

153
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,031
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because I'm upset.</font>

154
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:48,727
<font color="yellow">He shouldn't be wasting away
his youth over such a ridiculous woman.</font>

155
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,934
<font color="yellow">He'll get over it.</font>

156
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,156
<font color="yellow">He's doing this because he's young.</font>

157
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:58,725
<font color="yellow">And Jang-soo is a late bloomer.</font>

158
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:03,580
<font color="yellow">Who knows? He might be the
one who will feed you later on.</font>

159
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:11,520
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have to feed me. I just want
him to be able to make his own living.</font>

160
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:13,514
<font color="yellow">That woman...</font>

161
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:19,352
<font color="yellow">No matter what I do, I'm going
to make Jang-soo succeed!</font>

162
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,299
<font color="yellow">You better not mooch off
of him later on!</font>

163
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,012
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Yes?</font>

164
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,459
<font color="yellow">Sit up.</font>

165
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:37,119
<font color="yellow">I have a present for you.</font>

166
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:39,577
<font color="yellow">A present?</font>

167
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:41,748
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

168
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,092
<font color="yellow">Guess what it is.</font>

169
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:47,412
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

170
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:56,748
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

171
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,863
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

172
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:02,732
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't you recognize Yeong-cheol?</font>

173
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,225
<font color="yellow">He's your son, Yeong-cheol.</font>

174
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

175
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,389
<font color="yellow">My son.</font>

176
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,724
<font color="yellow">Yes... my Yeong-cheol...</font>

177
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:24,009
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this photo?</font>

178
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:31,424
<font color="yellow">I got it from Jang-go. I told him we didn't bring
any photos from North Korea, so he gave it to me.</font>

179
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,766
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

180
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,904
<font color="yellow">I can't thank him enough.</font>

181
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:41,608
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

182
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,287
<font color="yellow">Mom, Jang-go must be here.</font>

183
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,037
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

184
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:55,861
<font color="yellow">You were very surprised yesterday, weren't you?
I should've told you before. I was thoughtless.</font>

185
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,178
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

186
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:04,217
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be sorry. I feel like
we put you in a difficult position.</font>

187
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:05,624
<font color="yellow">We're sorry.</font>

188
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:12,930
<font color="yellow">By the way, since you're Yeong-cheol's friend,
can I speak informally to you?</font>

189
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:15,155
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

190
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:21,279
<font color="yellow">I think your mother had
a misunderstanding.</font>

191
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:28,002
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I think it's going to
be difficult for us to live here.</font>

192
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,791
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.
I'll talk to my mother again.</font>

193
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,969
<font color="yellow">No, don't do that.</font>

194
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:42,534
<font color="yellow">Just tell her not to worry because we'll leave
here as soon as we get our security deposit back.</font>

195
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,627
<font color="yellow">I don't know how long it'll take,
but let her know that as long</font>

196
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:55,459
<font color="yellow">as we're here, we'll make sure
she won't feel uncomfortable.</font>

197
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:01,375
<font color="yellow">By the way, thank you very much
for Yeong-cheol's photo.</font>

198
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,612
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, why are
you coming from there?</font>

199
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:19,928
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

200
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:21,866
<font color="yellow">Come inside.</font>

201
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,045
<font color="yellow">An apology?</font>

202
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,475
<font color="yellow">Why would you need to apologize to her?</font>

203
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:35,913
<font color="yellow">She was surprised because of me.
I told her I was sorry about that.</font>

204
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,952
<font color="yellow">You let them live here
without paying the</font>

205
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,966
<font color="yellow">security deposit.
So why should you apologize?</font>

206
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:43,039
<font color="yellow">They should bow down and thank you.</font>

207
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:46,178
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you being so unreasonable?</font>

208
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,181
<font color="yellow">They were going to
give you the security deposit</font>

209
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,740
<font color="yellow">later, and I did this
without Mi-poong knowing.</font>

210
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,787
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep blaming her family?</font>

211
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:57,448
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep defending
that North Korean girl?</font>

212
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,134
<font color="yellow">You're acting so strange.</font>

213
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:04,105
<font color="yellow">You're getting their security deposit back.
That should be</font>

214
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,459
<font color="yellow">the end. But you lied to me
and moved them into our house.</font>

215
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,678
<font color="yellow">You even drive that wench
around in your own car.</font>

216
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,728
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, tell me the truth.</font>

217
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:14,764
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

218
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:18,521
<font color="yellow">What is your relationship with Mi-poong?</font>

219
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:22,192
<font color="yellow">Is there really nothing
going on between you two?</font>

220
00:17:22,522 --> 00:17:23,522
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

221
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,964
<font color="yellow">Really? Are you sure?</font>

222
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,436
<font color="yellow">Mom, stop it.</font>

223
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:31,733
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

224
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:35,313
<font color="yellow">If there really is nothing going on between
you two, meet Hee-Ra one more time.</font>

225
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:36,338
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

226
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:39,709
<font color="yellow">We were talking about Mi-poong.
Why are you suddenly bringing Hee-Ra up?</font>

227
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,393
<font color="yellow">It's because I don't
understand you at all.</font>

228
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,545
<font color="yellow">And Hee-Ra is such a great catch!</font>

229
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,764
<font color="yellow">I really like her,</font>

230
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,865
<font color="yellow">and if you had at least pretended
to date her, I wouldn't be this upset.</font>

231
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,435
<font color="yellow">Later on, I'll bring a woman
that you'll really like.</font>

232
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:58,709
<font color="yellow">If there's really nothing going on
between you and that North</font>

233
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,607
<font color="yellow">Korean girl, and if you really
don't have a girlfriend,</font>

234
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:04,456
<font color="yellow">then meet Hee-Ra one more time.</font>

235
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,403
<font color="yellow">It's my wish.</font>

236
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,193
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll do that.</font>

237
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,358
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

238
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,506
<font color="yellow">You'll really meet her
one more time, right?</font>

239
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:18,686
<font color="yellow">Instead, don't make Mi-poong's family
uncomfortable while they're here. Okay?</font>

240
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:20,678
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

241
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,452
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

242
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,194
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll do that.</font>

243
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,386
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work.</font>

244
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:32,069
<font color="yellow">This time, you call Hee-Ra first, okay?</font>

245
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,769
<font color="yellow">You promised me! I believe in you!</font>

246
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:50,764
<font color="yellow">Why is she calling me?</font>

247
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:55,469
<font color="yellow">She made me sick and now she's giving me
medicine? Is she trying to comfort me?</font>

248
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,939
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have to do that.</font>

249
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:01,163
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

250
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,842
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra, you must have very upset, huh?</font>

251
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:09,178
<font color="yellow">I heard what happened.
But Hee-Ra, I think there's</font>

252
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:12,249
<font color="yellow">another misunderstanding
between you two.</font>

253
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
<font color="yellow">What misunderstanding?</font>

254
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:17,086
<font color="yellow">When you went to my son's
office that day, he had a</font>

255
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:20,268
<font color="yellow">very important case that
made him sensitive and dazed.</font>

256
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:23,724
<font color="yellow">That's why he had declined
your invitation to go to the movies.</font>

257
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:26,841
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

258
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:30,616
<font color="yellow">My son said he wants to meet you again.</font>

259
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:37,302
<font color="yellow">Well, if it was because of work,
I should understand.</font>

260
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,926
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

261
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:42,317
<font color="yellow">I love this side of you!</font>

262
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:45,333
<font color="yellow">Other girls would have
hesitated because of</font>

263
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,995
<font color="yellow">their pride, but you coolly
understand right away!</font>

264
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:51,357
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

265
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,419
<font color="yellow">Then have a good date with my son.</font>

266
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,753
<font color="yellow">Jang-go will call you.</font>

267
00:19:58,622 --> 00:19:59,925
<font color="yellow">Really, Ms. Hwang?</font>

268
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:10,386
<font color="yellow">You'll trip and fall down!</font>

269
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,216
<font color="yellow">Do you want to break your leg?</font>

270
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,770
<font color="yellow">Mom, how do I look?</font>

271
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,552
<font color="yellow">Do I look okay? Is my make-up okay?</font>

272
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:19,778
<font color="yellow">Is my dress too short? Check it!</font>

273
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,802
<font color="yellow">Who are you meeting that
you're making such a big fuss about it?</font>

274
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,677
<font color="yellow">Well I... I'll tell you
when I come back.</font>

275
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,235
<font color="yellow">Later, later. I'm late.</font>

276
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,734
<font color="yellow">Is she going to meet a man?</font>

277
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,102
<font color="yellow">Is she going to meet Geum-sil's son?</font>

278
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,446
<font color="yellow">I should call Geum-sil and ask her!</font>

279
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:44,318
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

280
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,250
<font color="yellow">She's mad because I told her
Hee-Ra doesn't like her son.</font>

281
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,615
<font color="yellow">What if I call her and she tells me
to pay her money back?</font>

282
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:58,069
<font color="yellow">I hope she's not going out
to meet strange guys.</font>

283
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,372
<font color="yellow">Goodness! She must have gone out!</font>

284
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,199
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I heard you can get sick
if you hold back from using the toilet.</font>

285
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,583
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I have to pee!</font>

286
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,708
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

287
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,505
<font color="yellow">What was that sound?</font>

288
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,333
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! I'm dying!</font>

289
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,958
<font color="yellow">That sounds like my mom's voice.</font>

290
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,107
<font color="yellow">Maid!</font>

291
00:21:42,482 --> 00:21:43,482
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

292
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am?</font>

293
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:51,941
<font color="yellow">Did you just shout,
"Oh my goodness! I'm dying!"</font>

294
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,341
<font color="yellow">Did you fall?</font>

295
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:54,575
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

296
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:58,962
<font color="yellow">Then did you hear someone say
"Oh my goodness?"</font>

297
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,341
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

298
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,846
<font color="yellow">Okay. You can go back to work.</font>

299
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:09,384
<font color="yellow">It sounded like my mom's voice.</font>

300
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:15,327
<font color="yellow">But why did I hear that strange sound?</font>

301
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:23,315
<font color="yellow">Mom should have called and complained
about having no money by now.</font>

302
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,057
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

303
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,961
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to her?</font>

304
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,425
<font color="yellow">What if she collapsed?</font>

305
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:36,768
<font color="yellow">She's my enemy, not my mom!</font>

306
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:54,036
<font color="yellow">I heard that if you break
your bone at my age, you'll die.</font>

307
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:57,685
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. I almost died.</font>

308
00:22:58,536 --> 00:22:59,536
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear!</font>

309
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:03,981
<font color="yellow">(My daughter Chung-ja)</font>

310
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,161
<font color="yellow">It's Chung-ja!</font>

311
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,190
<font color="yellow">What's that sound?</font>

312
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:20,258
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra and Hee-dong went out,
so no one is on the second floor.</font>

313
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:28,867
<font color="yellow">How can I hear two bell sounds?</font>

314
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,625
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Do I have an ear disease?</font>

315
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,756
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep hearing strange things?</font>

316
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,469
<font color="yellow">It's me, mom.</font>

317
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:45,302
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You called me first
this time. Thank you, Chung-ja.</font>

318
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:51,023
<font color="yellow">Were you worried and curious about me?</font>

319
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,468
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not curious at all!</font>

320
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:59,452
<font color="yellow">I was going to call someone else
and pressed your number by mistake.</font>

321
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,255
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

322
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,932
<font color="yellow">You little wench!
Are you really going to do this to me?</font>

323
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,544
<font color="yellow">Good-bye!</font>

324
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:07,328
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

325
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:10,286
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja...</font>

326
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,132
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was wrong.</font>

327
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,377
<font color="yellow">I thought about it, and you had
every reason to be angry.</font>

328
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,747
<font color="yellow">I really regretted it.</font>

329
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,870
<font color="yellow">So-</font>

330
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,057
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

331
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:28,281
<font color="yellow">So Chung-ja, let's meet up and talk.</font>

332
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,497
<font color="yellow">Mothers and daughters should be able to</font>

333
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:34,135
<font color="yellow">understand and forgive
each other for anything.</font>

334
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:39,174
<font color="yellow">I'll come to your house
right this instant!</font>

335
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:40,610
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're coming?</font>

336
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,994
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what I said last time?</font>

337
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:46,562
<font color="yellow">I told you I was never
going to see you again.</font>

338
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,933
<font color="yellow">Until you die, don't contact me.</font>

339
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:51,680
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

340
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:57,148
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! My daughter Chung-ja!
I miss you, Chung-ja!</font>

341
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,846
<font color="yellow">Don't call my name!
I'm not your daughter!</font>

342
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,372
<font color="yellow">Horrible wench! Spiteful wench!</font>

343
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:11,311
<font color="yellow">I was the one who gave birth to her!
That rude wench!</font>

344
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,394
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

345
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:17,863
<font color="yellow">Oh, my sacrum! Oh, my sacrum!</font>

346
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:21,956
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with them.</font>

347
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,338
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your hard work, Mi-poong.</font>

348
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:26,133
<font color="yellow">You're welcome. I'll see you next week.</font>

349
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:27,456
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

350
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:32,870
<font color="yellow">By the way, you said you were still
looking for more part-time jobs, right?</font>

351
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:34,347
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

352
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:35,597
<font color="yellow">Are there any?</font>

353
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:41,361
<font color="yellow">This company is looking for
a fitting model. Do you want to try it?</font>

354
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,190
<font color="yellow">Fitting model?</font>

355
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,986
<font color="yellow">I never did that before.</font>

356
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,063
<font color="yellow">It's not hard at all.</font>

357
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:51,721
<font color="yellow">You just have to wear the
sample clothes and stand still.</font>

358
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,901
<font color="yellow">It pays well, too,
so you should try it out.</font>

359
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:56,649
<font color="yellow">Okay! Thank you!</font>

360
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,245
<font color="yellow">The steak here is
slightly tough, isn't it?</font>

361
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:54,956
<font color="yellow">I think it's fine.</font>

362
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:59,478
<font color="yellow">The steak is much better at a French
restaurant I know. Let's go there next time.</font>

363
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,745
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

364
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:09,371
<font color="yellow">That's right! There's a famous steak restaurant
nearby! I totally forgot about that!</font>

365
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,135
<font color="yellow">The beef stock there is amazing.</font>

366
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:16,027
<font color="yellow">Each steak costs $300,
but you'll never regret it!</font>

367
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:18,714
<font color="yellow">I see...</font>

368
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:35,331
<font color="yellow">Just like mom said, when we leave the
house after getting our security deposit,</font>

369
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:40,060
<font color="yellow">then things with Jang-go
will come to an end, too.</font>

370
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:44,605
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

371
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:49,231
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be concerned
about who Jang-go dates.</font>

372
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:04,666
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you're tall and
good-looking with a good figure,</font>

373
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:07,523
<font color="yellow">so if you paid a little more
attention to your fashion,</font>

374
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,663
<font color="yellow">you would look like a celebrity.</font>

375
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:13,762
<font color="yellow">There are new shoes from Gucci,
and they're so beautiful!</font>

376
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:17,589
<font color="yellow">If we don't hurry up, all the sizes
will be gone, so let's finish this and</font>

377
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,871
<font color="yellow">go there. While we're there, you should
get a new suit and pick out a few ties.</font>

378
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,100
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility
of your fashion from now on.</font>

379
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:28,838
<font color="yellow">Later on, we'll change
your car to a cooler one.</font>

380
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:31,885
<font color="yellow">If things work out between us,
we can ask my mom to buy the car.</font>

381
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:36,213
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you're like
a blank sheet of paper.</font>

382
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,227
<font color="yellow">There are many things I want to change
about you, and I think it would be worthwhile.</font>

383
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,485
<font color="yellow">You know those kind of people
who wear brand names</font>

384
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:45,861
<font color="yellow">from head to toe
but don't seem like they do?</font>

385
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:53,314
<font color="yellow">But for you, Jang-go,
even if you just change</font>

386
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,183
<font color="yellow">your shoes, your fashion
would totally be better!</font>

387
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:01,454
<font color="yellow">Um, Hee-Ra...</font>

388
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:03,214
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

389
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,878
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I think
I have to tell you now.</font>

390
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:10,698
<font color="yellow">Tell me what?</font>

391
00:29:11,862 --> 00:29:14,968
<font color="yellow">My mother really liked you, so I tried
to meet with you one more time,</font>

392
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:17,638
<font color="yellow">but I don't think we'll work out.</font>

393
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:20,987
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

394
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,113
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

395
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:26,846
<font color="yellow">We have different tastes and interests.</font>

396
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,612
<font color="yellow">What are you interested in?</font>

397
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:32,253
<font color="yellow">Work.</font>

398
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:35,219
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long
since I opened up my office,</font>

399
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,537
<font color="yellow">so I want to focus on my work
until I can get settled in.</font>

400
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:39,335
<font color="yellow">You said the same thing last time.</font>

401
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:44,887
<font color="yellow">If it's for such a reason,
I can wait until you settled in.</font>

402
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,483
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

403
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,791
<font color="yellow">I have no wish to progress
my relationship with you.</font>

404
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,249
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

405
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:03,633
<font color="yellow">Did you call and ask to meet me
today just so you can tell me that?</font>

406
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:07,764
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll meet a good person,
since you're a charming woman.</font>

407
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:10,322
<font color="yellow">Are you joking? Are you playing around?</font>

408
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,389
<font color="yellow">Hey! You're so annoying!
I don't want to date you either!</font>

with a foreign language degree.</font>

in Pyeongyang?</font>

a little bit of Chinese, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo,</font>

418
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:26,790

your life in North Korea and</font>

<font color="yellow">think as if you are starting
from the very bottom.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll be there soon.</font>

440
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:24,245
<font color="yellow">I'm about to tell you this as someone
older than you, so don't feel too offended.</font>

441
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:26,885
<font color="yellow">Okay, please continue.</font>

442
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:32,406
<font color="yellow">I don't like the fact that you're hanging
around Jang-go. It concerns me.</font>

443
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:34,768
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

444
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,950
<font color="yellow">Jang-go has a lot of
attachment like his father.</font>

445
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:43,276
<font color="yellow">That's why he has to help
pitiful people when he sees them.</font>

446
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:45,940
<font color="yellow">He's always been like that
ever since he was little.</font>

447
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:50,825
<font color="yellow">So I don't want you to have
a weird misunderstanding here.</font>

448
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,259
<font color="yellow">I know very well, too.</font>

449
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:55,555
<font color="yellow">There's no misunderstanding.</font>

450
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:57,166
<font color="yellow">Then I'm glad.</font>

451
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,412
<font color="yellow">Jang-go went on a blind date
with a girl from a wealthy</font>

452
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:02,628
<font color="yellow">family, and things
are going very well for them.</font>

453
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,544
<font color="yellow">They'll be dating from now on,
and she'll visit our</font>

454
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,685
<font color="yellow">house sometimes.
What if she finds out about you?</font>

455
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,973
<font color="yellow">Jang-go will be misunderstood.</font>

456
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:15,159
<font color="yellow">You're not wishing
that will happen, are you?</font>

457
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:18,833
<font color="yellow">Of course not. How can
I wish for something like that?</font>

458
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:23,012
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then I'll believe in your words.</font>

459
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:27,878
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

460
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:33,208
<font color="yellow">from now on, don't use this door.
Make sure you go through the back door.</font>

461
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,167
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

462
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:19,893
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung!</font>

463
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:41,026
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

464
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,253
<font color="yellow">Good-bye!</font>

465
00:35:58,346 --> 00:35:59,810
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go.</font>

466
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,368
<font color="yellow">How dare he disregard me.</font>

467
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,797
<font color="yellow">I'm Jo Hee-Ra. Jo Hee-Ra. Got it?</font>

468
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:18,884
<font color="yellow">I got it. I said I got it!</font>

469
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:22,591
<font color="yellow">Open sesame!</font>

470
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:26,845
<font color="yellow">Are you disregarding me?</font>

471
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:29,120
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri!</font>

472
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:34,388
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to beat you with my head?</font>

473
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,447
<font color="yellow">Oh shoot.</font>

474
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,846
<font color="yellow">What the hell is this?</font>

475
00:36:41,872 --> 00:36:44,129
<font color="yellow">How much did she drink?</font>

476
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:47,839
<font color="yellow">Hey, you idiot!
You're supposed to press this!</font>

477
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,595
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me an idiot?</font>

478
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,713
<font color="yellow">Yes, you idiot! You're supposed
to press this, not push the door!</font>

479
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,542
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

480
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:50,979
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

481
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:59,565
<font color="yellow">Yes, you idiot! You're supposed
to press this, not push the door!</font>

482
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:04,532
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. What did I do?</font>

483
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,026
<font color="yellow">Why am I lying here with that guy?</font>

484
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:08,996
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed!</font>

485
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:15,755
<font color="yellow">It seems like both of you woke up.</font>

486
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:18,807
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head.</font>

487
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:24,496
<font color="yellow">Both of you fainted from shock. There's nothing
especially wrong with either of you.</font>

488
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:27,663
<font color="yellow">Are you sure? How can there be
nothing wrong when it hurts so much?</font>

489
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:33,542
<font color="yellow">If you want an image examination,
please let the front desk know.</font>

490
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:35,815
<font color="yellow">Why was she laughing?</font>

491
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:42,019
<font color="yellow">How much on earth did you drink that
caused you to smash my head like this?</font>

492
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:44,551
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about my head?</font>

493
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:48,192
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

494
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:50,205
<font color="yellow">How dare you play innocent.</font>

495
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:51,752
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

496
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,565
<font color="yellow">Or are you pretending not to?</font>

497
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,042
<font color="yellow">You were the one who did this!</font>

498
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:06,547
<font color="yellow">Well... I can't remember very well...</font>

499
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:10,953
<font color="yellow">It's the first time
I saw so many stars at once.</font>

500
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:14,434
<font color="yellow">I thought there was a firework of stars
exploding in my head! Bang, bang, bang!</font>

501
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:17,666
<font color="yellow">What if I have a concussion?</font>

502
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:19,788
<font color="yellow">Why does it hurt so much?</font>

503
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:21,737
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

504
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:25,213
<font color="yellow">Stop exaggerating!
Even me, a weak woman, is fine!</font>

505
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,175
<font color="yellow">Are you saying my head is a rock?</font>

506
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,010
<font color="yellow">About bumping into your head, did I
even ask you to open the door for me?</font>

507
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,737
<font color="yellow">You opened the door out of nowhere
and caused me to fall!</font>

508
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,312
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. Look here.</font>

509
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:41,697
<font color="yellow">When something like this happens,
the first thing you should do is apologize.</font>

510
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:44,851
<font color="yellow">You should tell me not to worry because
you protected my head from cracking</font>

511
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:47,840
<font color="yellow">open on the ground and that I should
not worry about the hospital bills!</font>

512
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:50,283
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to say
"I'm sorry and thank you" first!</font>

513
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:55,010
<font color="yellow">But you're pretending like you don't
remember and blaming me instead?</font>

514
00:39:56,243 --> 00:39:59,257
<font color="yellow">You're a very ungrateful woman!</font>

515
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:01,604
<font color="yellow">Sheesh! Fine! I got it!</font>

516
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,831
<font color="yellow">- I'll pay the hospital bills!
- Of course you will!</font>

517
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:06,879
<font color="yellow">You're a really pathetic cheapskate!</font>

518
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,397
<font color="yellow">What? Pathetic? Cheapskate?</font>

519
00:40:09,422 --> 00:40:10,422
<font color="yellow">Me? Me?</font>

520
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:13,651
<font color="yellow">Wow! This woman has no conscience!</font>

521
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:17,960
<font color="yellow">Hey, you better wait.
You wait right there! Oh, that little-</font>

522
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:20,565
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my head?</font>

523
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:31,549
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

524
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,686
<font color="yellow">I'm starving!</font>

525
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:43,623
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm only eating food
without anyone knowing about it?</font>

526
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:47,853
<font color="yellow">Why am I always hungry?</font>

527
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:54,901
<font color="yellow">I can't wake up Hee-dong again.</font>

528
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:58,330
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry!</font>

529
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,362
<font color="yellow">Ghost!</font>

530
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:24,200
<font color="yellow">- It's a ghost!
- Who are you?</font>

531
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:26,324
<font color="yellow">It's a ghost!</font>

532
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,342
<font color="yellow">Elder!</font>

533
00:41:31,604 --> 00:41:33,117
<font color="yellow">Father! Father!</font>

534
00:41:36,854 --> 00:41:37,854
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

535
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:48,547
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

536
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:52,640
<font color="yellow">- Mother!
- Grandma!</font>

537
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,610
<font color="yellow">Grandma, wake up!</font>

538
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:55,635
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

539
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,026
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong...</font>

540
00:41:58,339 --> 00:41:59,549
<font color="yellow">a ghost...</font>

541
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:04,652
<font color="yellow">He's not a ghost, grandma.
He's my grandfather.</font>

542
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:09,126
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

543
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:24,143
<font color="yellow">So you were hiding in
Hee-dong's room all this time?</font>

544
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:26,787
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

545
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:31,193
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, you should have
told me beforehand. What's all this?</font>

546
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:32,831
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

547
00:42:32,856 --> 00:42:35,927
<font color="yellow">I told him not to tell you.
Hee-dong did nothing wrong.</font>

548
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:38,814
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

549
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:45,493
<font color="yellow">I caused you trouble.
I'm too embarrassed to face you.</font>

550
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:50,385
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chun, you're welcome in our home.</font>

551
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:54,826
<font color="yellow">Why did you stay here so uncomfortably?</font>

552
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:58,315
<font color="yellow">You hid from Chung-ja as well.</font>

553
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:05,871
<font color="yellow">That's because I made
many mistakes to my daughter.</font>

554
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:11,713
<font color="yellow">So I was going to disappear without
a trace once I found a place to live.</font>

555
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:18,765
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to trouble you or Dal-ho.</font>

556
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,748
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I was going to only
stay here for a few days, but then-</font>

557
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:24,773
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

558
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,182
<font color="yellow">Still, how could you come in here?</font>

559
00:43:30,445 --> 00:43:34,812
<font color="yellow">How dare you coax my innocent
Hee-dong and show up here?</font>

560
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:36,015
<font color="yellow">No, mom.</font>

561
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,851
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.
Grandma said she didn't want</font>

562
00:43:38,876 --> 00:43:41,268
<font color="yellow">- to, but I forced her to come in.
- Jo Hee-dong.</font>

563
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:43,655
<font color="yellow">I know your grandmother
better than you do.</font>

564
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,147
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll believe your words?</font>

565
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:49,132
<font color="yellow">Mom,</font>

566
00:43:49,905 --> 00:43:52,081
<font color="yellow">if you really didn't
want to trouble anyone,</font>

567
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:55,082
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't have
come anywhere near here.</font>

568
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,772
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to
act like a stray cat?</font>

569
00:43:58,187 --> 00:43:59,187
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

570
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:01,120
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

571
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:04,674
<font color="yellow">Would I say that
if things weren't this bad?</font>

572
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:11,382
<font color="yellow">The tears I shed because of
you could fill up the Han River!</font>

573
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:13,631
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, that's enough.</font>

574
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:18,006
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if you had a bad
relationship with her. She's still your parent.</font>

575
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:20,273
<font color="yellow">How can you do that to her?</font>

576
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:22,258
<font color="yellow">You're a mother yourself.</font>

577
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,106
<font color="yellow">How can you not be as nice as Hee-dong?</font>

578
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:29,414
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

579
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,116
<font color="yellow">The guest room
back there is empty, right?</font>

580
00:44:32,468 --> 00:44:34,019
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's empty.</font>

581
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,906
<font color="yellow">Then give that room
to Hee-dong's grandmother.</font>

582
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:41,125
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll do that.</font>

583
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:43,780
<font color="yellow">No, Mr. Kim.</font>

584
00:44:44,757 --> 00:44:48,094
<font color="yellow">I can't trouble you like this.</font>

585
00:44:48,507 --> 00:44:49,840
<font color="yellow">It's fine, Ms. Chun.</font>

586
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:52,030
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

587
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:55,913
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja is like my daughter-in-law.</font>

588
00:44:57,265 --> 00:45:00,983
<font color="yellow">I was inattentive all this time.</font>

589
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:04,095
<font color="yellow">This is all my fault.</font>

590
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:09,861
<font color="yellow">Since things turned out this way,
you should comfortably stay here.</font>

591
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,039
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

592
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:16,918
<font color="yellow">It's late. Go back to bed.</font>

593
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:19,109
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

594
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:30,059
<font color="yellow">I should go back to bed. Good night.</font>

595
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:34,474
<font color="yellow">Mother, come this way.</font>

596
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:50,465
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

597
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,046
<font color="yellow">If it's very uncomfortable,
you can switch bedrooms with us.</font>

598
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:56,390
<font color="yellow">No, it's great.</font>

599
00:45:56,415 --> 00:45:57,415
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

600
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:01,470
<font color="yellow">If you have a conscience,
leave the house at</font>

601
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:04,535
<font color="yellow">dawn without anyone
knowing about it! Got it?</font>

602
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:09,929
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

603
00:46:09,954 --> 00:46:10,954
<font color="yellow">That woman.</font>

604
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:15,690
<font color="yellow">Mother, she'll get over it.
Don't worry about it.</font>

605
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:17,921
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

606
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,639
<font color="yellow">If Chung-ja tells me to leave,
I should leave. I don't have a choice.</font>

607
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:26,944
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

608
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:30,937
<font color="yellow">You know she's weak-hearted
even if she speaks like that.</font>

609
00:46:31,273 --> 00:46:34,038
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to her,
so please stay comfortably.</font>

610
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:35,289
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

611
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:36,859
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

612
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,093
<font color="yellow">Then good night.</font>

613
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:49,445
<font color="yellow">Why would I leave?
There's nowhere else I can go!</font>

614
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:58,837
<font color="yellow">It feels great
after the storm passed by!</font>

615
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:07,631
<font color="yellow">I feel much better after I got caught.</font>

616
00:47:07,655 --> 00:47:10,690
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's so comfortable.</font>

617
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,765
<font color="yellow">Mom, why did you
come home so late last night?</font>

618
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,343
<font color="yellow">Where did you go?</font>

619
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:23,632
<font color="yellow">Oh, just there and there.</font>

620
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,963
<font color="yellow">I was trying to look for a job.</font>

621
00:47:25,987 --> 00:47:27,365
<font color="yellow">You were looking for a job?</font>

622
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,148
<font color="yellow">What job?</font>

623
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,171
<font color="yellow">I'll be the one who's working.</font>

624
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,913
<font color="yellow">I'm a mom, so how can
I let you suffer alone?</font>

625
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:42,383
<font color="yellow">And we need to hurry up and work to make
money so that we can leave this house.</font>

626
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:45,094
<font color="yellow">I like this house.</font>

627
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:49,399
<font color="yellow">We're not moving right now.
We meant that we were going</font>

628
00:47:49,424 --> 00:47:51,744
<font color="yellow">to move to a better house after
we make a lot of money.</font>

629
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:53,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

630
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,261
<font color="yellow">Here, Yoo-sung. Eat different foods.</font>

631
00:47:57,671 --> 00:47:58,797
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

632
00:48:12,398 --> 00:48:15,182
<font color="yellow">Are you and Hee-Ra really over?</font>

633
00:48:16,398 --> 00:48:18,749
<font color="yellow">Yes, so stop talking about her.</font>

634
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:21,897
<font color="yellow">How can you do that when
I begged you to be with her?</font>

635
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:23,762
<font color="yellow">I'm off to work.</font>

636
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,549
<font color="yellow">Why on earth do you dislike Hee-Ra?</font>

637
00:48:30,936 --> 00:48:35,010
<font color="yellow">You don't even have a girlfriend,
so how can you flatly reject her?</font>

638
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,272
<font color="yellow">I just don't like her.
Must I have a reason?</font>

639
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:41,523
<font color="yellow">Yes, tell me so that I can understand.</font>

640
00:48:41,991 --> 00:48:43,927
<font color="yellow">What on earth don't you like about her?</font>

641
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:49,798
<font color="yellow">Mom, Hee-Ra wears $2000 shoes.</font>

642
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:53,490
<font color="yellow">What? $2000?</font>

643
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:57,256
<font color="yellow">Do you know what she talked
about while we ate?</font>

644
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,567
<font color="yellow">What kind of designer bags she likes,
what clothes and shoes brands she only</font>

645
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:05,380
<font color="yellow">wears, what brand is like at what mall,
and what different restaurants are like.</font>

646
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:07,124
<font color="yellow">That was all.</font>

647
00:49:07,882 --> 00:49:10,076
<font color="yellow">Do you think I would be
compatible with such a person?</font>

648
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,280
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

649
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:14,065
<font color="yellow">What about it? What's so bad about that?</font>

650
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:18,132
<font color="yellow">It's not like she steals them.
She has brand-name bags and</font>

651
00:49:18,157 --> 00:49:21,724
<font color="yellow">expensive shoes because she can
afford them. So what's bad about that?</font>

652
00:49:23,124 --> 00:49:26,230
<font color="yellow">I want you to succeed,
wear brand-name clothes,</font>

653
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:29,101
<font color="yellow">and live a good life in
a wealthy household.</font>

654
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:30,717
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

655
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:33,611
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, don't you have
any ambitions or dreams?</font>

656
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:38,501
<font color="yellow">Are you going to end your life in a tiny
office taking on small, pathetic cases?</font>

657
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:42,136
<font color="yellow">Mom, I do have ambitions and dreams.</font>

658
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:47,365
<font color="yellow">But I don't want to marry a girl I can't
communicate with and mooch off my in-laws.</font>

659
00:49:48,546 --> 00:49:52,315
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I'm going to achieve my dreams with
my own strength. I have the confidence.</font>

660
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,873
<font color="yellow">So don't arrange such meetings anymore.</font>

661
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,540
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my marriage.</font>

662
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:00,904
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Jang-go.</font>

663
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:01,929
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go!</font>

664
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,031
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jo Hee-Ra! What happened to you
last night? You disappeared out of nowhere!</font>

665
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,685
<font color="yellow">You drank alone again, didn't you?</font>

666
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:32,991
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

667
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:34,921
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

668
00:50:35,874 --> 00:50:36,874
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

669
00:50:38,686 --> 00:50:40,284
<font color="yellow">This is Hee-ra's phone number.</font>

670
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,521
<font color="yellow">What the heck is this?</font>

671
00:50:56,944 --> 00:50:57,944
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

672
00:51:00,788 --> 00:51:02,788
<font color="yellow">Did my phone switch with hers?</font>

673
00:51:13,584 --> 00:51:15,226
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

674
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:21,508
<font color="yellow">Just like me, you have soft skin.</font>

675
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:25,162
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty.</font>

676
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:28,499
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

677
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:31,999
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's me!</font>

678
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,498
<font color="yellow">Grandma, when did you come?</font>

679
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,007
<font color="yellow">Yesterday.</font>

680
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:44,152
<font color="yellow">Starting from today, I'm going to
live with you. Are you happy or not?</font>

681
00:51:44,507 --> 00:51:45,788
<font color="yellow">I'm happy.</font>

682
00:51:45,913 --> 00:51:48,108
<font color="yellow">Oh my lovely baby.</font>

683
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:50,756
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

684
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:54,921
<font color="yellow">Why do you have a bruise on your forehead?
Did you bump into something?</font>

685
00:51:55,132 --> 00:52:00,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Last night,
I bumped into a rockhead-</font>

686
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:05,029
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my ringtone?</font>

687
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:07,758
<font color="yellow">Is it not my phone?</font>

688
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:13,242
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

689
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:18,468
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? No matter how drunk
you are, how can you take my phone instead?</font>

690
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,025
<font color="yellow">Did you take my phone on purpose?</font>

691
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:23,657
<font color="yellow">Bring my phone to me right now!</font>

692
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:26,506
<font color="yellow">What? What's wrong with you?</font>

693
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:28,951
<font color="yellow">Fine! I got it!</font>

694
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:38,834
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

695
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:41,248
<font color="yellow">- Hold on.
- Okay.</font>

696
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:50,615
<font color="yellow">We'll take a few photos.</font>

697
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:51,866
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

698
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,161
<font color="yellow">Relax. Be comfortable.</font>

699
00:52:56,186 --> 00:52:57,319
<font color="yellow">Okay, here we go!</font>

700
00:52:58,452 --> 00:52:59,452
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

701
00:53:00,616 --> 00:53:02,873
<font color="yellow">Very good. Let's take a few more.</font>

702
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:06,265
<font color="yellow">Okay, keep it up.</font>

703
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:08,256
<font color="yellow">Can you change your position?</font>

704
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:11,405
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

705
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:16,757
<font color="yellow">Very good.</font>

706
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,099
<font color="yellow">You have the right height and a good figure,
so you're a good fitting model.</font>

707
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,123
<font color="yellow">Good job, Ms. Kim.</font>

708
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,791
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

709
00:53:39,732 --> 00:53:41,161
<font color="yellow">Help us again next time, okay?</font>

710
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:44,619
<font color="yellow">Okay! Please call me anytime.</font>

711
00:53:45,452 --> 00:53:46,745
<font color="yellow">You can change your clothes.</font>

712
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:02,490
<font color="yellow">Where's the chief?</font>

713
00:54:02,515 --> 00:54:03,515
<font color="yellow">She's upstairs.</font>

714
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,068
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! Oh, no!</font>

715
00:54:08,421 --> 00:54:10,561
<font color="yellow">What do I do? What do I do?</font>

716
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:12,573
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm sorry.</font>

717
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:13,889
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

718
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:17,618
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

719
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:19,561
<font color="yellow">You didn't leave yet?</font>

720
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,096
<font color="yellow">I wanted to say good-bye to you.</font>

721
00:54:22,499 --> 00:54:24,521
<font color="yellow">You could have just left.</font>

722
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:26,619
<font color="yellow">I'm glad it wasn't hot coffee.</font>

723
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:30,470
<font color="yellow">But you're wearing white. This won't do.</font>

724
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:31,936
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

725
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:34,086
<font color="yellow">Change into this.</font>

726
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,334
<font color="yellow">No, I can just wash my clothes at home.</font>

727
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:40,501
<font color="yellow">Just wear it. Your clothes
got wet because of me.</font>

728
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:42,937
<font color="yellow">And this fit you well earlier.</font>

729
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:45,869
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as a bonus
for working hard today. Okay?</font>

730
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,202
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

731
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:51,188
<font color="yellow">Enjoy. See you again.</font>

732
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:52,303
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

733
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,329
<font color="yellow">Since when have you been following me?</font>

734
00:55:53,522 --> 00:55:55,851
<font color="yellow">Come on. I wasn't following you.</font>

735
00:55:56,038 --> 00:55:57,305
<font color="yellow">I just saw you now.</font>

736
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:01,519
<font color="yellow">But where did you go dressed so nicely?</font>

737
00:56:02,577 --> 00:56:05,253
<font color="yellow">Did you go meet your secret boyfriend?</font>

738
00:56:05,952 --> 00:56:09,288
<font color="yellow">That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of!</font>

739
00:56:10,335 --> 00:56:13,061
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing else to do,
just go home and sleep.</font>

740
00:56:17,092 --> 00:56:18,092
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

741
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:20,707
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

742
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,866
<font color="yellow">Was I that funny?</font>

743
00:56:23,577 --> 00:56:28,018
<font color="yellow">Well, I was just joking, but you took
it so seriously, so it was funny.</font>

744
00:56:28,342 --> 00:56:29,342
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

745
00:56:30,014 --> 00:56:31,769
<font color="yellow">It's fun to tease me, isn't it?</font>

746
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:35,695
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go now, so laugh
all you want by yourself.</font>

747
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,460
<font color="yellow">Stupid.</font>

748
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,717
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong! When are you going
to buy me black bean noodles?</font>

749
00:56:43,116 --> 00:56:44,383
<font color="yellow">Black bean noodles?</font>

750
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:47,326
<font color="yellow">Come on. You said you were going
to buy black bean noodles.</font>

751
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:50,967
<font color="yellow">All you do is say "Thank you."</font>

752
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,941
<font color="yellow">Was that an empty promise?</font>

753
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:54,538
<font color="yellow">An empty promise?</font>

754
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:56,842
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

755
00:56:59,788 --> 00:57:00,988
<font color="yellow">Just set the date.</font>

756
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:04,294
<font color="yellow">I can buy that measly
black bean noodles anytime you want.</font>

757
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:05,592
<font color="yellow">You mean that?</font>

758
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:06,819
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

759
00:57:07,576 --> 00:57:09,137
<font color="yellow">Black bean noodles is nothing.</font>

760
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:10,553
<font color="yellow">Why would I lie about that?</font>

761
00:57:11,272 --> 00:57:12,272
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

762
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,202
<font color="yellow">Then buy that for me right now.</font>

763
00:57:15,288 --> 00:57:16,288
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

764
00:57:32,608 --> 00:57:33,608
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

765
00:57:42,632 --> 00:57:43,632
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

766
00:57:44,717 --> 00:57:48,465
<font color="yellow">Is it delicious because this restaurant
made it well or because it's free?</font>

767
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,210
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

768
00:57:50,803 --> 00:57:53,201
<font color="yellow">If it's that delicious, eat a lot.</font>

769
00:57:53,226 --> 00:57:54,226
<font color="yellow">You should eat, too.</font>

770
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:55,988
<font color="yellow">I'll eat a lot, too.</font>

771
00:57:56,132 --> 00:57:57,398
<font color="yellow">That's it. No more.</font>

772
00:58:08,936 --> 00:58:11,811
<font color="yellow">You should wipe yourself.
You have black bean sauce on you.</font>

773
00:58:23,803 --> 00:58:26,866
<font color="yellow">How can you get things on
your face like a baby does?</font>

774
00:58:28,874 --> 00:58:31,514
<font color="yellow">Do people know you're such a farthing?</font>

775
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:34,225
<font color="yellow">Nope.</font>

776
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:46,550
<font color="yellow">It was delicious,
but I feel kind of bloated.</font>

777
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,306
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's wrong?</font>

778
00:58:48,936 --> 00:58:51,266
<font color="yellow">Did you get indigestion
from black bean noodles?</font>

779
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,187
<font color="yellow">I thought you were eating fast.</font>

780
00:58:53,212 --> 00:58:54,212
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

781
00:58:54,787 --> 00:58:59,227
<font color="yellow">I just feel guilty
because you paid for it.</font>

782
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:02,983
<font color="yellow">I thought you were talking
about something else.</font>

783
00:59:03,008 --> 00:59:04,008
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

784
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:06,477
<font color="yellow">Since you bought
black bean noodles, tell me</font>

785
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,852
<font color="yellow">whatever you want to do it.
I'll make it happen.</font>

786
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:10,555
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing.</font>

787
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:17,092
<font color="yellow">The black bean noodles is stuck
right here and won't go down...</font>

788
00:59:17,499 --> 00:59:18,499
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

789
00:59:19,842 --> 00:59:22,175
<font color="yellow">There was something I wanted to do.</font>

790
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,147
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

791
00:59:25,608 --> 00:59:28,700
<font color="yellow">To be honest, it's been almost
two years since I came to Seoul,</font>

792
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:31,707
<font color="yellow">but I haven't been able to look around properly.</font>

793
00:59:33,124 --> 00:59:37,182
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to go to Seoul Tower.</font>

794
00:59:37,936 --> 00:59:38,936
<font color="yellow">Seoul Tower?</font>

795
00:59:39,374 --> 00:59:40,661
<font color="yellow">That's not hard at all.</font>

796
00:59:41,319 --> 00:59:42,319
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

797
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:44,595
<font color="yellow">What? Right now?</font>

798
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:45,882
<font color="yellow">Yes, right now.</font>

799
00:59:46,608 --> 00:59:48,342
<font color="yellow">It's not a hard thing, so why delay it?</font>

800
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:51,655
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I'll be able to
get some fresh air. Let's go.</font>

801
01:01:50,946 --> 01:01:52,192
<font color="yellow">I need to stop drinking.</font>

802
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:54,797
<font color="yellow">I'll never drink again.</font>

803
01:01:56,568 --> 01:01:57,568
<font color="yellow">(Please press)</font>

804
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:07,149
<font color="yellow">Here is your cell-phone.</font>

805
01:02:08,087 --> 01:02:09,087
<font color="yellow">Here's yours.</font>

806
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:16,179
<font color="yellow">I had important plans today.
What's this?</font>

807
01:02:16,204 --> 01:02:17,782
<font color="yellow">I'm so annoyed!</font>

808
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:19,470
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

809
01:02:21,423 --> 01:02:22,423
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

810
01:02:23,259 --> 01:02:25,352
<font color="yellow">It seems like you don't
have any plans anymore.</font>

811
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:28,021
<font color="yellow">How about you have some beer?</font>

812
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:30,868
<font color="yellow">Beer?</font>

813
01:02:33,852 --> 01:02:38,093
<font color="yellow">You didn't do it on purpose.
I was a bit harsh yesterday.</font>

814
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:39,993
<font color="yellow">Since you paid for the hospital bills,</font>

815
01:02:40,813 --> 01:02:42,013
<font color="yellow">I'll buy the drinks.</font>

816
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,431
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

817
01:02:45,204 --> 01:02:46,934
<font color="yellow">You do have some manners after all.</font>

818
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:52,282
<font color="yellow">Cheers to seeing stars together.</font>

819
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:54,841
<font color="yellow">Okay, cheers.</font>

820
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,470
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

821
01:02:58,634 --> 01:02:59,634
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

822
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:05,840
<font color="yellow">X! X!</font>

823
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,745
<font color="yellow">He's a pathetic mama's boy!</font>

824
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:14,206
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing you broke up with him!</font>

825
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:17,812
<font color="yellow">Break-up wasn't even called for!</font>

826
01:03:18,118 --> 01:03:25,655
<font color="yellow">I just feel like I've been used
by that man and his mother.</font>

827
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:28,282
<font color="yellow">That's why I feel offended. That's all.</font>

828
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:31,865
<font color="yellow">My pride was hurt.</font>

829
01:03:32,587 --> 01:03:34,346
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it's a good thing!</font>

830
01:03:34,913 --> 01:03:39,756
<font color="yellow">Your pride doesn't have to be hurt over
a pathetic man who isn't even worth a penny!</font>

831
01:03:40,477 --> 01:03:44,722
<font color="yellow">At times like this,
my grandma always says this.</font>

832
01:03:45,024 --> 01:03:46,892
<font color="yellow">"Your ancestors have helped you."</font>

833
01:03:49,056 --> 01:03:53,167
<font color="yellow">Your ancestors helped you
break up with that man!</font>

834
01:03:54,899 --> 01:04:00,993
<font color="yellow">That's right! You're right! I think
you're right! Now I feel so much better!</font>

835
01:04:01,018 --> 01:04:04,017
<font color="yellow">Yes! To your ancestors!</font>

836
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,852
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Cheers!</font>

837
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:20,954
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I was able to
visit Namsan Seoul Tower today.</font>

838
01:04:22,204 --> 01:04:24,782
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong has succeeded!</font>

839
01:04:27,352 --> 01:04:28,352
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

840
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:33,813
<font color="yellow">Hey Kim Mi-poong, until when
will you speak formally to me?</font>

841
01:04:34,618 --> 01:04:36,515
<font color="yellow">You should speak informally
like you used to.</font>

842
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,470
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

843
01:04:39,915 --> 01:04:41,182
<font color="yellow">I'll try to fix it.</font>

844
01:04:42,306 --> 01:04:43,306
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

845
01:04:43,602 --> 01:04:45,133
<font color="yellow">Yes, like that.</font>

846
01:04:48,782 --> 01:04:52,457
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong, can I ask you something?</font>

847
01:04:53,837 --> 01:04:54,837
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

848
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:56,662
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and ask me.</font>

849
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:01,625
<font color="yellow">Why did you change
your name to Kim Mi-poong?</font>

850
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:11,334
<font color="yellow">My father gave me that new name
so that I can forget</font>

851
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,246
<font color="yellow">all about my name in North Korea
and live a new life.</font>

852
01:05:19,563 --> 01:05:25,636
<font color="yellow">Seeds aren't spread by fierce winds
but by gentle breezes.</font>

853
01:05:28,907 --> 01:05:31,137
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to become
a gentle breeze like that.</font>

854
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:33,850
<font color="yellow">That's what my father said.</font>

855
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:41,797
<font color="yellow">That's why I really like
my name Kim Mi-poong.</font>

856
01:05:52,384 --> 01:05:56,860
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, do you still remember
everything that happened in Macau, too?</font>

857
01:05:59,657 --> 01:06:00,657
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

858
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:06,431
<font color="yellow">Back then, I had taught you
Michael Jackson's dance, too.</font>

859
01:06:07,337 --> 01:06:08,337
<font color="yellow">I remember.</font>

860
01:06:08,984 --> 01:06:11,536
<font color="yellow">When I think about how
a little tadpole like yourself</font>

861
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:14,065
<font color="yellow">criticized me for not being
able to dance the moon walk,</font>

862
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,223
<font color="yellow">I still can't sleep
because I was wronged.</font>

863
01:06:17,031 --> 01:06:18,793
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you were wronged?</font>

864
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:22,281
<font color="yellow">It was the first time I had
seen an awful dancer like you.</font>

865
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:24,829
<font color="yellow">How can you not be able to do that?</font>

866
01:06:25,227 --> 01:06:26,227
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

867
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:30,049
<font color="yellow">I'm good at the moon walk now.</font>

868
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,220
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

869
01:06:32,664 --> 01:06:33,664
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

870
01:06:33,962 --> 01:06:36,682
<font color="yellow">When I was in the army,
one of the soldiers was a good dancer,</font>

871
01:06:36,707 --> 01:06:39,318
<font color="yellow">and I got special lessons from him.</font>

872
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:41,047
<font color="yellow">Special lessons?</font>

873
01:06:42,985 --> 01:06:44,489
<font color="yellow">It seems like you don't believe me.</font>

874
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:48,584
<font color="yellow">Want me to show you?</font>

875
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:50,709
<font color="yellow">You wait right here.</font>

876
01:06:52,056 --> 01:06:53,056
<font color="yellow">Watch.</font>

877
01:07:05,266 --> 01:07:07,015
<font color="yellow">How can you not know how to dance that?</font>

878
01:07:07,602 --> 01:07:09,949
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you
received special lessons?</font>

879
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:12,257
<font color="yellow">I wonder why you can't do this.</font>

880
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,049
<font color="yellow">Watch me carefully.</font>

881
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:18,547
<font color="yellow">You move your foot back like this.</font>

882
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:22,759
<font color="yellow">Like this. Like this. Like this.</font>

883
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:54,476
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

884
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:55,501
<font color="yellow">Mi-Jung.</font>

885
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:57,209
<font color="yellow">Mi-Jung, that wench.</font>

886
01:07:57,234 --> 01:07:59,001
<font color="yellow">Give me my money!</font>

887
01:07:59,026 --> 01:08:02,064
<font color="yellow">We did sleep together,
but nothing happened!</font>
