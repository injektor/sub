<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,053
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

8
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,922
<font color="yellow">Why is this dumpling so delicious?</font>

9
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:21,373
<font color="yellow">It's hot!</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

13
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,803
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

14
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:38,132
<font color="yellow">That was your father, wasn't it?</font>

15
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:43,291
<font color="yellow">Yes, that was him! He was right in front
of my eyes! He really was father, mom!</font>

16
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,764
<font color="yellow">- Where did he go?
- It really is him!</font>

17
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:49,822
<font color="yellow">- Father!
- Dae-hoon!</font>

18
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,561
<font color="yellow">Grandfather.</font>

19
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,490
<font color="yellow">Please get up.</font>

20
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:02,873
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, please eat some porridge.
You'll get very sick at this rate!</font>

21
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:09,703
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, what will I do if
something happens to you, too?</font>

22
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,248
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, don't cry.</font>

23
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:14,022
<font color="yellow">I'll get up.</font>

24
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:20,281
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, you need to gain strength
in order to find Dae-hoon.</font>

25
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:23,663
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

26
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:30,069
<font color="yellow">Where did dad go in this cold winter?</font>

27
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:34,865
<font color="yellow">What if something happened to him?</font>

28
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:38,683
<font color="yellow">No, that's impossible.</font>

29
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,951
<font color="yellow">It took so much effort to find him.</font>

30
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,405
<font color="yellow">Grandfather.</font>

31
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:50,869
<font color="yellow">Oh, she's definitely a fox. How the
heck is she able to cry so easily?</font>

32
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:53,930
<font color="yellow">I can't even release one teardrop.</font>

33
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,745
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and answer it.</font>

34
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:04,436
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

35
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:05,881
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

36
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,296
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

37
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:08,452
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

38
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:10,039
<font color="yellow">Did they find Dae-hoon?</font>

39
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:14,434
<font color="yellow">Or did something happen to him?</font>

40
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:39,972
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, are you sure that was your father?</font>

41
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,303
<font color="yellow">Did you mistaken him for someone else?</font>

42
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,631
<font color="yellow">How can I not recognize him?</font>

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,305
<font color="yellow">But why can't he recognize you?</font>

44
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:50,060
<font color="yellow">How can he not recognize who you are?</font>

45
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,367
<font color="yellow">I was right next to you.
How could he not recognize us?</font>

46
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:55,603
<font color="yellow">But the strange thing is...</font>

47
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,741
<font color="yellow">father...</font>

48
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,375
<font color="yellow">looked a bit strange.</font>

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,817
<font color="yellow">I was so close to him,
but he couldn't recognize me.</font>

50
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,505
<font color="yellow">On top of that, he stole a dumpling.</font>

51
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:13,912
<font color="yellow">Mom, what if father lost his memory?</font>

52
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:17,700
<font color="yellow">Father would have definitely searched
for us if he was in South Korea, but</font>

53
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,719
<font color="yellow">he didn't. What if he couldn't find us
because he had lost his memory?</font>

54
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,237
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

55
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:26,986
<font color="yellow">Also, his clothes were so shabby,
and he looked like one</font>

56
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:30,084
<font color="yellow">of those homeless people
who wander around the streets.</font>

57
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,733
<font color="yellow">He really was father,
but he didn't seem like father.</font>

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,030
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure?
- Yes.</font>

59
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:43,272
<font color="yellow">If father really lost his memory, then
we must find him as quickly as possible.</font>

60
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:48,429
<font color="yellow">I hate to think of him wandering around
on the streets in this cold weather.</font>

61
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,139
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

62
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,570
<font color="yellow">Let's find your father.</font>

63
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,357
<font color="yellow">Seeing that he came to eat our dumpling,
he's probably somewhere in this area.</font>

64
00:04:57,655 --> 00:04:58,995
<font color="yellow">Let's search this whole area.</font>

65
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:02,099
<font color="yellow">If father really did lose his memory,
he wouldn't be able to</font>

66
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:04,796
<font color="yellow">know anything about the ads
and fliers we posted about him.</font>

67
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,431
<font color="yellow">Still, someone else will see it
and contact us.</font>

68
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,115
<font color="yellow">Let's write down all the characteristics</font>

69
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:14,100
<font color="yellow">about your father to make sure
someone can contact us about him.</font>

70
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,608
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

71
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,725
<font color="yellow">(Out at the moment)</font>

72
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:27,374
<font color="yellow">Mom, let's go underground.
There are many homeless people there.</font>

73
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:30,389
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's go everywhere from
the underground tunnel to the park.</font>

74
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,347
<font color="yellow">- I'll carry those.
- It's fine.</font>

75
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,858
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, stick close to me.</font>

76
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,624
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

77
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:13,014
<font color="yellow">- Try these dumplings. They're still warm.
- Thank you.</font>

78
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:23,785
<font color="yellow">Mister, we have a question for you.</font>

79
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,792
<font color="yellow">Did you see anyone here who
speaks in a North Korean dialect?</font>

80
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:31,678
<font color="yellow">He's my father. His name is Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

81
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:35,476
<font color="yellow">You can't find anyone here
with just their names.</font>

82
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:38,474
<font color="yellow">Everyone is wandering around
with their own stories.</font>

83
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,568
<font color="yellow">He has big and bright eyes,
and he wears glasses.</font>

84
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,237
<font color="yellow">He's in his mid-sixties,
and he's of medium height.</font>

85
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,905
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I've never seen him before.</font>

86
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,065
<font color="yellow">Yes, we understand.</font>

87
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,131
<font color="yellow">Thank you for listening to us.</font>

88
00:06:58,788 --> 00:06:59,881
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's go.</font>

89
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:29,053
<font color="yellow">- (Father's Dumplings)
- We're looking for someone.</font>

90
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:38,205
<font color="yellow">Where is my son Dae-hoon?</font>

91
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,718
<font color="yellow">We got your call. Where is he?</font>

92
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,417
<font color="yellow">He's right here.</font>

93
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

94
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

95
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:56,211
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon! Dae-hoon!</font>

96
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:58,272
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon!</font>

97
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,712
<font color="yellow">Father! Father!</font>

98
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,801
<font color="yellow">- Dae-hoon!
- Father!</font>

99
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:10,701
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon! Where did you go?</font>

100
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,623
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I was looking for you?</font>

101
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:24,381
<font color="yellow">But why do you look like this?</font>

102
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:27,233
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

103
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:31,045
<font color="yellow">I don't know, father.</font>

104
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,925
<font color="yellow">I was searching for you
for a long time, father!</font>

105
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:40,920
<font color="yellow">You were searching for me?</font>

106
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:00,522
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

107
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,105
<font color="yellow">You weren't lost?</font>

108
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,862
<font color="yellow">Someone had forcefully dragged you away?</font>

109
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:11,477
<font color="yellow">- Are you saying someone had kidnapped you?
- Yes.</font>

110
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:15,014
<font color="yellow">Who kidnapped you?</font>

111
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,951
<font color="yellow">Tell us, Dae-hoon.
Tell us who had kidnapped you.</font>

112
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,684
<font color="yellow">Is it someone you know?</font>

113
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,694
<font color="yellow">They were men I have never met before.</font>

114
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:28,687
<font color="yellow">Two men forced me into a van.</font>

115
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,780
<font color="yellow">When I woke up, it was night.</font>

116
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:36,670
<font color="yellow">I peeked outside and realized I was
at a sea port that was filled with ships.</font>

117
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:38,369
<font color="yellow">Sea port?</font>

118
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:42,244
<font color="yellow">So they were planning
to force you onto a ship?</font>

119
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,318
<font color="yellow">Where is that sea port?</font>

120
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:50,131
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't know where that is.</font>

121
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:54,977
<font color="yellow">Two men were talking to another man outside.</font>

122
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,936
<font color="yellow">The driver was snoring while he was sleeping,</font>

123
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:03,804
<font color="yellow">so I snuck out of the van and secretly
climbed into the back of a truck.</font>

124
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:10,249
<font color="yellow">But that truck kept going deeper
and deeper into the woods!</font>

125
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,701
<font color="yellow">The truck driver stopped the truck to go pee.</font>

126
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,012
<font color="yellow">I quickly got out of
the car and ran away then.</font>

127
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,528
<font color="yellow">I was so scared.</font>

128
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,740
<font color="yellow">How frightened you must have been to be in the</font>

129
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:30,662
<font color="yellow">forest all by yourself
in the middle of winter.</font>

130
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:34,286
<font color="yellow">It's a miracle that you came back alive.</font>

131
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:38,513
<font color="yellow">I was cold, scared, and hungry.</font>

132
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:44,404
<font color="yellow">But this one man said he'd give me food if
I clean up cow dung, so I followed him.</font>

133
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:48,353
<font color="yellow">Those darn cows pooed all day long!</font>

134
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,951
<font color="yellow">I thought I was dying from
cleaning up all the cow dung!</font>

135
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:57,248
<font color="yellow">Really? My goodness.</font>

136
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:04,658
<font color="yellow">Oh, my poor Dae-hoon.
You suffered so much away from home.</font>

137
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,807
<font color="yellow">So you should've just stayed home.
Why did you go out by yourself?</font>

138
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,977
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae said it was your birthday,
so she wanted me to</font>

139
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:19,625
<font color="yellow">secretly come out to plan
a surprise party for you.</font>

140
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,692
<font color="yellow">That's why I had gone out.</font>

141
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:25,745
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, what is he talking about?</font>

142
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,928
<font color="yellow">What's this about my birthday?</font>

143
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,633
<font color="yellow">Dad, what are you saying?</font>

144
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,901
<font color="yellow">Maybe you dreamt the whole thing.
I had an important</font>

145
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:39,909
<font color="yellow">meeting that day, so I was at the company.</font>

146
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,577
<font color="yellow">You told me to come out.</font>

147
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:46,197
<font color="yellow">You said nobody should know
about our surprise party for</font>

148
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,731
<font color="yellow">father so I should sneak out
without the housekeeper knowing.</font>

149
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:50,410
<font color="yellow">When did I say that?</font>

150
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:54,119
<font color="yellow">Dad, what's wrong with you?
Why are you making things up?</font>

151
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,672
<font color="yellow">You told me to come out! You told me to meet</font>

152
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:58,716
<font color="yellow">you in the alley next to the stationary store!</font>

153
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:00,839
<font color="yellow">So why are you lying?</font>

154
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:05,764
<font color="yellow">- Dad, what's wrong with you?
- Please calm down.</font>

155
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,401
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't he go to his room and rest now?</font>

156
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:12,971
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think father is very shocked.</font>

157
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,983
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, go to your room.</font>

158
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:22,777
<font color="yellow">I'm serious, father. That's why I really left.</font>

159
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:24,658
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

160
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:29,781
<font color="yellow">You'll be fine after you go to
your room and take a nap.</font>

161
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,717
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

162
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:34,207
<font color="yellow">I'm telling the truth.</font>

163
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,630
<font color="yellow">You told me that!</font>

164
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,263
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

165
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:43,303
<font color="yellow">What do we do about my dad? I'm so upset.</font>

166
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,943
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you never
said that to him before?</font>

167
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,261
<font color="yellow">Yes. It wasn't even
grandfather's birthday that day,</font>

168
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,429
<font color="yellow">so why would I tell him such a thing?</font>

169
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,436
<font color="yellow">What if he's going back and forth
between the present and past?</font>

170
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:01,922
<font color="yellow">It seems like he had been
pretty shocked after being lost.</font>

171
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,032
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong is right!</font>

172
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:08,241
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we admit him into the hospital?</font>

173
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,599
<font color="yellow">Don't even say that.</font>

174
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:12,163
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- Don't say that in front of Mr. Kim.</font>

175
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:16,711
<font color="yellow">We can't live with him if he keeps
saying whimsical things like that.</font>

176
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:22,358
<font color="yellow">Mother, didn't it seem like grandfather,</font>

177
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:25,111
<font color="yellow">father-in-law, and
Hee-dong were suspecting me?</font>

178
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:28,242
<font color="yellow">No. How could they suspect you?</font>

179
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:33,452
<font color="yellow">It seemed like they thought he was saying
whimsical things while he was out of it.</font>

180
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,601
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

181
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:39,032
<font color="yellow">Of course. They didn't
seem suspicious of you at all.</font>

182
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,853
<font color="yellow">Anyways, how did he manage to come back alive?</font>

183
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:43,521
<font color="yellow">He's indestructible!</font>

184
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,942
<font color="yellow">How nice would it have
been if he could have just</font>

185
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,780
<font color="yellow">cleaned up cow dung for the rest of his life?</font>

186
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,702
<font color="yellow">Anyways, keep an eye on him.</font>

187
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,252
<font color="yellow">His memory can't come back, so if you think</font>

188
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,302
<font color="yellow">something is fishy, let me know right away.</font>

189
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:02,186
<font color="yellow">All right. But what will we do
about that bomb from now on?</font>

190
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:13,335
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

191
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:21,959
<font color="yellow">Do you know how anxious
I was when you were gone?</font>

192
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:28,084
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you.</font>

193
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,457
<font color="yellow">I'll die.</font>

194
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:36,357
<font color="yellow">Father, don't die. Okay?</font>

195
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,311
<font color="yellow">Please live for a long, long time.</font>

196
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:41,593
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

197
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,366
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon...</font>

198
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:50,147
<font color="yellow">let's never be apart
for the rest of our lives.</font>

199
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:51,779
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

200
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:56,224
<font color="yellow">I'll never let go of your hand from now on.</font>

201
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,459
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

202
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:01,944
<font color="yellow">I cried so much after losing you.</font>

203
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:09,217
<font color="yellow">I was so cold, hungry, and scared.</font>

204
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:15,882
<font color="yellow">But father, the truth is...</font>

205
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:18,428
<font color="yellow">I was so hungry...</font>

206
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,678
<font color="yellow">that I stole something just once.</font>

207
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:25,069
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

208
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,670
<font color="yellow">You stole something?</font>

209
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,100
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

210
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:31,968
<font color="yellow">I stole one dumpling and ate it.</font>

211
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,608
<font color="yellow">One dumpling?</font>

212
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:39,246
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. How hungry must
you have been to do something like that.</font>

213
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:47,158
<font color="yellow">But Dae-hoon, the owner
would have understood you.</font>

214
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:50,409
<font color="yellow">So don't blame yourself.</font>

215
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:55,866
<font color="yellow">No, father. I really want to
pay that dumpling store back.</font>

216
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:57,819
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that.</font>

217
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:01,893
<font color="yellow">Let's go back there tomorrow and
pay them back for the dumpling.</font>

218
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:04,218
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

219
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,116
<font color="yellow">But that dumpling was so delicious.</font>

220
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,881
<font color="yellow">It tasted just like the
ones mother used to make.</font>

221
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,857
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

222
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,329
<font color="yellow">While I ate that dumpling...</font>

223
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,246
<font color="yellow">I thought of mother...</font>

224
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:26,520
<font color="yellow">and cried so much.</font>

225
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:29,685
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

226
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:37,013
<font color="yellow">I want to eat those dumplings, too.</font>

227
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:42,314
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, let's go to that
dumpling store tomorrow,</font>

228
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:45,381
<font color="yellow">pay them back for the dumpling you stole,</font>

229
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,661
<font color="yellow">and buy more dumplings to eat.</font>

230
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,344
<font color="yellow">- Yes, father.
- Good.</font>

231
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,357
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

232
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,167
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking about father?</font>

233
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,296
<font color="yellow">It must be because we saw those
people staying underground.</font>

234
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:16,165
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking of so
many different possibilities.</font>

235
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,419
<font color="yellow">Where is your father and what is he doing?</font>

236
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,653
<font color="yellow">If he really is mentally unstable,</font>

237
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,692
<font color="yellow">did he get beaten up while trying
to steal food from somewhere else?</font>

238
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,802
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you saying such nonsense?</font>

239
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,832
<font color="yellow">You know father is a strong person.</font>

240
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:42,075
<font color="yellow">If he's alive, he'll be safe.</font>

241
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:43,798
<font color="yellow">I'm going to believe that.</font>

242
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:46,451
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

243
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,147
<font color="yellow">That's true, right?</font>

244
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:52,539
<font color="yellow">Mom, how about we give out
dumplings to those homeless people</font>

245
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:55,465
<font color="yellow">living in that underground
tunnel every single day?</font>

246
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,880
<font color="yellow">We won't be able to give much,
but wouldn't father come there</font>

247
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:03,740
<font color="yellow">one day when he hears out
we're giving out free dumplings?</font>

248
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:07,593
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's a good idea.</font>

249
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:12,768
<font color="yellow">We can help those in need by
giving them the dumplings we made.</font>

250
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,209
<font color="yellow">It would be great if we could
find your father while doing that.</font>

251
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,107
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- Yes, it's a good idea.</font>

252
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,949
<font color="yellow">We will need to work harder
and make more money if</font>

253
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:25,342
<font color="yellow">we want to give many
dumplings to the homeless.</font>

254
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,578
<font color="yellow">Yes, we will.</font>

255
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,900
<font color="yellow">You're a much better person than I am.</font>

256
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:47,616
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae said it was your birthday,
so she wanted me to secretly come</font>

257
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:51,215
<font color="yellow">out to plan a surprise party for you.
That's why I had gone out.</font>

258
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,802
<font color="yellow">When did I say that?</font>

259
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,528
<font color="yellow">Dad, what's wrong with you?
Why are you making things up?</font>

260
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,798
<font color="yellow">You told me to come out! You told me to meet</font>

261
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:00,951
<font color="yellow">you in the alley next to the stationary store!</font>

262
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:02,997
<font color="yellow">So why are you lying?</font>

263
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,530
<font color="yellow">Did Shin-ae really...?</font>

264
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:11,935
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

265
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:18,614
<font color="yellow">Why would she make up such a lie?</font>

266
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:20,390
<font color="yellow">Of course she wouldn't.</font>

267
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,028
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

268
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,161
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

269
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:54,935
<font color="yellow">You had witnessed your son and
wife being shot in front of your eyes.</font>

270
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:00,575
<font color="yellow">Of course you wouldn't be sane.</font>

271
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,143
<font color="yellow">Still, it's okay.</font>

272
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:05,607
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

273
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:12,583
<font color="yellow">You just have to stay by my side.</font>

274
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,198
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, are you going somewhere with dad?</font>

275
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:38,339
<font color="yellow">I feel nervous about leaving
Dae-hoon at home by himself.</font>

276
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,615
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take him
around with me for a while.</font>

277
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:47,254
<font color="yellow">Last time I wasn't home, so that
incident occurred, but don't worry now.</font>

278
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:51,573
<font color="yellow">I'll stick to him like a bodyguard
and take him around with me!</font>

279
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,228
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, how dare you! It doesn't matter
that he has the mind of a child right now!</font>

280
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:58,557
<font color="yellow">What? Take him around with you?</font>

281
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:00,748
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

282
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,130
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of him very well.</font>

283
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,877
<font color="yellow">You can leave him at home, grandfather.</font>

284
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:10,604
<font color="yellow">Mother will protect him well.</font>

285
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,138
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

286
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,151
<font color="yellow">After my meeting today,
we're going to go to the</font>

287
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:20,380
<font color="yellow">dumpling store to pay them
back for the dumpling he ate.</font>

288
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:21,662
<font color="yellow">Dumpling?</font>

289
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:23,841
<font color="yellow">Yes, dumpling.</font>

290
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:29,417
<font color="yellow">It tasted exactly like the ones
my mother used to make.</font>

291
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:33,501
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Father and I will go
and buy a lot of dumplings.</font>

292
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,794
<font color="yellow">Okay, dad.</font>

293
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,614
<font color="yellow">- Dae-hoon, let's go.
- Yes, father.</font>

294
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,433
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

295
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,583
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

296
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:52,297
<font color="yellow">But what if his memory comes back
while he's with Mr. Kim?</font>

297
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:55,566
<font color="yellow">We need to separate those two somehow.</font>

298
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,838
<font color="yellow">Grandfather became sensitive
because of what happened,</font>

299
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,115
<font color="yellow">so let's take some time to think
about a way to solve this.</font>

300
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,442
<font color="yellow">If we make the wrong move,
they might suspect us.</font>

301
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:10,513
<font color="yellow">That's true. We did touch
the tiger's whiskers.</font>

302
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,747
<font color="yellow">- Hey, bring that in here.
- Welcome- oh! Hello, ma'am!</font>

303
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:17,450
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Hello.</font>

304
00:22:17,787 --> 00:22:18,920
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

305
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:22,764
<font color="yellow">Congratulations! I wish you success!</font>

306
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:26,400
<font color="yellow">If you need any extra help, call me anytime.</font>

307
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,646
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you for your kind words.</font>

308
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,661
<font color="yellow">- Put that up there.
- Yes, grandma.</font>

309
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,294
<font color="yellow">Oh, what's this?</font>

310
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:39,222
<font color="yellow">It's kimchi. It was fermented
very well, so I brought it.</font>

311
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:41,015
<font color="yellow">You can use it in your kimchi dumplings.</font>

312
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:44,323
<font color="yellow">Oh, you didn't have
to do that. Thank you.</font>

313
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:47,122
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat. I'll prepare
a plate of dumplings for you.</font>

314
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:52,489
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. We're not your customers.
Just treat us comfortably.</font>

315
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,681
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, please give me ten packs of dumplings</font>

316
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:57,967
<font color="yellow">so I can give them to my theater colleagues.</font>

317
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:00,302
<font color="yellow">- Sure. Please wait a moment.
- Okay.</font>

318
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:02,521
<font color="yellow">Where's Mi-poong?</font>

319
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,590
<font color="yellow">She took Yoo-sung to school.</font>

320
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:06,615
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

321
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,091
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

322
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,779
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- No, you don't have to pay me.
You even brought kimchi for me.</font>

323
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:23,139
<font color="yellow">- That's not even my kimchi. Please take it.
- Oh, no!</font>

324
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:24,887
<font color="yellow">- Grandma, I'm going!
- Bye.</font>

325
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:25,912
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

326
00:23:26,825 --> 00:23:30,650
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am...
- Just take it. It'll make
everyone feel comfortable.</font>

327
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,268
<font color="yellow">All right. Thank you.</font>

328
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,988
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Do you know him?</font>

329
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:03,943
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

330
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,669
<font color="yellow">I saw my husband yesterday.</font>

331
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:11,044
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious?</font>

332
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,769
<font color="yellow">Your husband is really alive in Seoul?</font>

333
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:18,989
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

334
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:24,341
<font color="yellow">But he must be living on the streets.</font>

335
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,524
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong said that
his appearance was terrible.</font>

336
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,755
<font color="yellow">I feel like he'll come back again.</font>

337
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:35,715
<font color="yellow">That's why every time a man passes by,
I can't help but check on him.</font>

338
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:38,658
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

339
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:43,247
<font color="yellow">How could something like that happen?</font>

340
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,643
<font color="yellow">You don't look well.</font>

341
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,177
<font color="yellow">Why? Is something wrong?</font>

342
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,583
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

343
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,669
<font color="yellow">Nothing works out the way I want it to.</font>

344
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,260
<font color="yellow">Are you holding a candle to the sun?</font>

345
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:03,290
<font color="yellow">Who else has a better life than you?
You must be joking.</font>

346
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:07,366
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'm sorry for complaining
when my life is perfect.</font>

347
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,741
<font color="yellow">But what did you need to see me for?</font>

348
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:16,429
<font color="yellow">I want you to find a prospective
marriage partner for Jang-go.</font>

349
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,684
<font color="yellow">You said you would take responsibility and</font>

350
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,693
<font color="yellow">find marriage partners for him
once he gets a divorce.</font>

351
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:21,997
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

352
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,031
<font color="yellow">You said you would do this after
the consideration period is over.</font>

353
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:32,982
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong signed the divorce papers but
continued to meet Jang-go behind my back.</font>

354
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:36,342
<font color="yellow">And now, she even took his money.</font>

355
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:37,755
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

356
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:42,199
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.
She has no conscience whatsoever.</font>

357
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,620
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong and her mother took his money
and opened up a dumpling store.</font>

358
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:48,599
<font color="yellow">What? A dumpling store?</font>

359
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:49,857
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

360
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:54,601
<font color="yellow">I was so stunned and
frustrated thinking about how she</font>

361
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:58,751
<font color="yellow">ruined my son's life and took
his money that I almost died!</font>

362
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:02,778
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Of course you'd feel that way.
Didn't you do anything about it though?</font>

363
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,421
<font color="yellow">You should've grabbed
her hair and ripped it off!</font>

364
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,368
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to do that, but I held it in.</font>

365
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:14,708
<font color="yellow">It's like he gave her an alimony,
so they're totally over now.</font>

366
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:20,332
<font color="yellow">So even if I tell him to date other women,
he'll have no other choice but to.</font>

367
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,724
<font color="yellow">Okay, don't worry. Just trust me.</font>

368
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,468
<font color="yellow">Are you coming just now?</font>

369
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,200
<font color="yellow">Hello, ma'am.</font>

370
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:37,174
<font color="yellow">Are you standing up to go
just because I'm here?</font>

371
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:40,485
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and stay here longer.</font>

372
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,442
<font color="yellow">Have some dumplings as well.</font>

373
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,023
<font color="yellow">- Try them.
- Mother.</font>

374
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:48,291
<font color="yellow">Did you go to Mi-poong's dumpling store again?</font>

375
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:52,080
<font color="yellow">That family has nothing to do with us anymore!</font>

376
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:57,411
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I'm going with my own
two feet, so mind your own business.</font>

377
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:03,710
<font color="yellow">Mother, that dumpling store
was bought with Jang-go's money!</font>

378
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:05,339
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that anger you?</font>

379
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:10,119
<font color="yellow">If you live such a hardscrabble life,
all of your blessings will disappear!</font>

380
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:13,416
<font color="yellow">Jang-go bought that store
for them because they deserved it!</font>

381
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:16,748
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Jang-go, Mi-poong's
family was able to meet</font>

382
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,541
<font color="yellow">her father whom they
thought was dead all this time.</font>

383
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:23,151
<font color="yellow">Jang-go will become very blessed!</font>

384
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:25,855
<font color="yellow">What did you say? They were able to meet</font>

385
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,002
<font color="yellow">her father whom they
thought was dead all this time?</font>

386
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,907
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shocked?</font>

387
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:34,024
<font color="yellow">It's my granddaughter-in-law
who found her father.</font>

388
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,544
<font color="yellow">Mother, what are you talking about?</font>

389
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,544
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she met her father?</font>

390
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:41,989
<font color="yellow">She thought her father had died while
they were escapingNorth Korea,</font>

391
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:45,099
<font color="yellow">but he came to the dumpling store,</font>

392
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:47,161
<font color="yellow">although they did lose him.</font>

393
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:49,768
<font color="yellow">Why would they lose him when they met?</font>

394
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:53,809
<font color="yellow">It seems like he lost his memory.
He didn't recognize them and just ran off.</font>

395
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:59,204
<font color="yellow">So Mi-poong and her mother are
going crazy trying to find him.</font>

396
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:03,116
<font color="yellow">- They said they were going
to buy dumplings today.
- What's wrong?</font>

397
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,872
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja! What's wrong?
- What's wrong? Are you okay?</font>

398
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,355
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you all of a sudden?</font>

399
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,455
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I just have anemia lately.</font>

400
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,729
<font color="yellow">I'll be leaving now. Bye, Geum-sil.</font>

401
00:28:14,754 --> 00:28:18,655
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja, don't forget my favor!
- Okay...</font>

402
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,317
<font color="yellow">She must be eating
all the best things in life.</font>

403
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:28,145
<font color="yellow">Why would she have anemia? Why would
she faint all the time? My goodness.</font>

404
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:29,638
<font color="yellow">That's odd.</font>

405
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,091
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

406
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,762
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, we're in big trouble!
What will we do?</font>

407
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,415
<font color="yellow">What's all the fuss about?</font>

408
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:45,092
<font color="yellow">I think the dumpling store Mr. Kim and his son
are going to today belongs to Mi-poong!</font>

409
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,733
<font color="yellow">It's Mi-poong's dumpling store!</font>

410
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:50,796
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about?</font>

411
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,672
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong opened up a dumpling store.</font>

412
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,515
<font color="yellow">Her dad came by the store
yesterday, but she lost him,</font>

413
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,272
<font color="yellow">so she's going crazy looking for him!</font>

414
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:02,778
<font color="yellow">Impossible.</font>

415
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:07,601
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim and his son wouldn't have
met Mi-poong already, would they?</font>

416
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,130
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

417
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,497
<font color="yellow">He was at the company.
His meeting ended just now.</font>

418
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:18,333
<font color="yellow">Is Mr. Kim in his office?</font>

419
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:20,928
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

420
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:22,521
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

421
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:26,075
<font color="yellow">What did he say?
He's not in his office, is he?</font>

422
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:30,560
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. They must have
gone already. What do we do now?</font>

423
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,153
<font color="yellow">Do you know where that dumpling
store is? Hurry up and find out.</font>

424
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:36,626
<font color="yellow">Okay, I can find out. Hold on.</font>

425
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:43,188
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, where is that
dumpling store located?</font>

426
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,982
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! It's true!</font>

427
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:55,142
<font color="yellow">They even named it Father's Dumplings!</font>

428
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:59,552
<font color="yellow">- (Father's Dumplings)
- Oh my god. Shin-ae,
what can we do about them?</font>

429
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,005
<font color="yellow">I just want to set that store on fire!</font>

430
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:08,335
<font color="yellow">We told them to America, but
they wouldn't! Why are they doing this?</font>

431
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:11,325
<font color="yellow">He must have gone there by
coincidence while at night.</font>

432
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,739
<font color="yellow">He won't be able to find this dumpling store.</font>

433
00:30:14,388 --> 00:30:16,766
<font color="yellow">Yes. He doesn't even know the Seoul streets-</font>

434
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:19,388
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

435
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,669
<font color="yellow">He's coming with Mr. Kim over there!</font>

436
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:33,693
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

437
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,646
<font color="yellow">I think it was somewhere here.</font>

438
00:30:40,295 --> 00:30:44,115
<font color="yellow">How did they come here? What do we do?</font>

439
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,607
<font color="yellow">Mother, stay still. Stay still!</font>

440
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,945
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is the wrong place, too?</font>

441
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:56,569
<font color="yellow">This place seems right...
but it seems wrong, too...</font>

442
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,291
<font color="yellow">Father, all Seoul streets look the same.</font>

443
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:02,737
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

444
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:06,249
<font color="yellow">How would you be able to memorize
a street that you only came once?</font>

445
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:12,266
<font color="yellow">But Dae-hoon, do you remember
the name of the dumpling store?</font>

446
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,016
<font color="yellow">I was so hungry back then. I only looked at</font>

447
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,466
<font color="yellow">- the dumplings. I didn't see the sign.
- I see.</font>

448
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:21,803
<font color="yellow">Let's take our time searching for it.</font>

449
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,125
<font color="yellow">Since we're here, let's go
to that alley over there.</font>

450
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:28,573
<font color="yellow">- Over there.
- Yes, father.</font>

451
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,191
<font color="yellow">Hold on. I'm getting a call.</font>

452
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:48,605
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's Shin-ae.</font>

453
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,066
<font color="yellow">Hi, Shin-ae.</font>

454
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:55,511
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, where are you? I'm sick!</font>

455
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,912
<font color="yellow">Okay! Your father and
I will be home immediately!</font>

456
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:04,566
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

457
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,542
<font color="yellow">Father, what's wrong?</font>

458
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:09,361
<font color="yellow">- Shin-ae seems to be very sick.
- Huh?</font>

459
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,267
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry up and go.</font>

460
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:15,341
<font color="yellow">Where is she sick? Hurry up and get in.</font>

461
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,170
<font color="yellow">Good job. You did well.</font>

462
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:33,659
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

463
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:37,350
<font color="yellow">Like you said, it seems like he doesn't
know where the dumpling store is.</font>

464
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:40,909
<font color="yellow">We need to arrive at home
before grandfather does.</font>

465
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,667
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up and go! Hurry!
- Okay.</font>

466
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:53,597
<font color="yellow">You were completely fine
when I saw you at the company earlier.</font>

467
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,261
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

468
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:59,261
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae had acute indigestion.</font>

469
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:06,399
<font color="yellow">She must have been very shocked
about not knowing her dad's whereabouts.</font>

470
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
<font color="yellow">Of course she must have been.</font>

471
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,240
<font color="yellow">But Shin-ae, you don't have to worry anymore.</font>

472
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:17,714
<font color="yellow">Your father returned safely, and
something like this will never happen again.</font>

473
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:20,643
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, don't worry.</font>

474
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:22,863
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

475
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:25,027
<font color="yellow">Okay, dad.</font>

476
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:28,980
<font color="yellow">But you said you were going to buy dumplings.</font>

477
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:32,630
<font color="yellow">- Did you find the dumpling store?
- No, we didn't.</font>

478
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:39,044
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon doesn't remember where it is at all.</font>

479
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:45,886
<font color="yellow">Dad, mother and I will make you
delicious dumplings later on.</font>

480
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:49,038
<font color="yellow">So don't waste your energy looking for it.</font>

481
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,852
<font color="yellow">I must find it.</font>

482
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:54,058
<font color="yellow">I really want to pay them back
for the dumpling I ate.</font>

483
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:57,832
<font color="yellow">One dumpling doesn't cost much.</font>

484
00:33:58,363 --> 00:34:00,933
<font color="yellow">One day, you'll be able to pay them back.</font>

485
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,573
<font color="yellow">Do you know how wide Seoul is?</font>

486
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:06,051
<font color="yellow">You don't even know where it is. How will you</font>

487
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:07,895
<font color="yellow">be able to find that small dumpling store?</font>

488
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:12,410
<font color="yellow">But how did you know that
dumpling store is small?</font>

489
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:16,149
<font color="yellow">Dumpling stores are usually small.</font>

490
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:19,472
<font color="yellow">I've never seen big dumpling stores before.</font>

491
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:25,399
<font color="yellow">Dad, later on, I'll go with you
to find the dumpling store.</font>

492
00:34:25,424 --> 00:34:27,649
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Really.</font>

493
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:38,023
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</font>

494
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:44,150
<font color="yellow">- It's freezing! I'm here, mother!
- Welcome!</font>

495
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:45,353
<font color="yellow">I came to eat lunch.</font>

496
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,154
<font color="yellow">Okay. Have a seat.</font>

497
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,333
<font color="yellow">Where is Mi-poong? Why are you alone?</font>

498
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,649
<font color="yellow">Oh, she went to make a delivery.</font>

499
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,931
<font color="yellow">- Oh.
- Sit down.</font>

500
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:54,469
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- This place is delicious.</font>

501
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:55,561
<font color="yellow">- It is?
- Yeah.</font>

502
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,019
<font color="yellow">- Welcome!
- Welcome! Please sit here.</font>

503
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:01,899
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

504
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:03,798
<font color="yellow">- Dumpling soup.
- Three dumpling soup.</font>

505
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:05,024
<font color="yellow">- Three dumpling soup.
- Yes.</font>

506
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:06,481
<font color="yellow">Three dumpling soup, mother!</font>

507
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,431
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

508
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,446
<font color="yellow">- I'm back!
- Hi.</font>

509
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:20,281
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

510
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,259
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

511
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:25,673
<font color="yellow">What else would I be doing?
I'm helping your mother.</font>

512
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm busy!</font>

513
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,010
<font color="yellow">What did you need to tell me?</font>

514
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:42,522
<font color="yellow">If you're going to tell me not to
come here again, don't even start.</font>

515
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:43,694
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to listen.</font>

516
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:45,470
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's wrong with you?</font>

517
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:49,806
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what I said? I told you
to never come back here again!</font>

518
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,727
<font color="yellow">I told you to not even start with that.</font>

519
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:53,392
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

520
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:57,301
<font color="yellow">Our consideration period is
almost over. If we just go to court</font>

521
00:35:57,326 --> 00:36:00,165
<font color="yellow">and report our divorce,
we'll be completely strangers then.</font>

522
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,465
<font color="yellow">So why on earth are you doing this?</font>

523
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:07,553
<font color="yellow">If you do this, not only does it get harder
for me, but it'll get harder for you, too.</font>

524
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:11,306
<font color="yellow">So please get over me as soon as you can.</font>

525
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:14,774
<font color="yellow">Forget about me and go your way! Please!</font>

526
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,963
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, must I tell you again?</font>

527
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:21,325
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you.</font>

528
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,462
<font color="yellow">Even now, I want to leave home
and get back together with you.</font>

529
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:25,487
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

530
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:26,858
<font color="yellow">Should we do that?</font>

531
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,306
<font color="yellow">You saw what your mother did here yesterday.</font>

532
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:33,876
<font color="yellow">So how can you say that?</font>

533
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:39,602
<font color="yellow">Let's believe that time will
solve our issues with her.</font>

534
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:45,661
<font color="yellow">When she sees us living happily with
our adorable kids, she'll come to accept us.</font>

535
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,259
<font color="yellow">And when is that?</font>

536
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:50,734
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be hurt any longer.</font>

537
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:52,141
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

538
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:58,720
<font color="yellow">I don't care about getting hurt, but I don't
want to see my mother getting hurt again.</font>

539
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,009
<font color="yellow">So move on and have a clean, fresh start.</font>

540
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:09,157
<font color="yellow">If we get a divorce and you meet an
amazing woman who your mother will like,</font>

541
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,666
<font color="yellow">you'll be able to forget about me, a lowly
woman who works at a dumpling store.</font>

542
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:16,073
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to talk that way?</font>

543
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:17,798
<font color="yellow">See you at court.</font>

544
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:21,142
<font color="yellow">I'm going to pay you back for this!</font>

545
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,317
<font color="yellow">You don't even know my how I feel.</font>

546
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:37,484
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr. Kim.</font>

547
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:40,231
<font color="yellow">You came early today, too.</font>

548
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:45,181
<font color="yellow">Yes, well, when I thought about
how bored you would be without me,</font>

549
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,353
<font color="yellow">I sped over here from Bundang.</font>

550
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:55,223
<font color="yellow">Don't ever do that again! What will
I do if you get into an accident?</font>

551
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:05,048
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, here is the record of today's sales.</font>

552
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:06,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

553
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:07,762
<font color="yellow">Yes, right here.</font>

554
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:17,945
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, is this a six or a zero?</font>

555
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,228
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

556
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,970
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

557
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:22,447
<font color="yellow">It's a zero.</font>

558
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:41,888
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, aren't you hungry?</font>

559
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,408
<font color="yellow">Go downstairs and eat some bread.</font>

560
00:38:45,962 --> 00:38:49,444
<font color="yellow">Call your friends over and eat as
much as you want. I'll pay for everything.</font>

561
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:52,176
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I already bought bread.</font>

562
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,380
<font color="yellow">Won-bin...</font>

563
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,976
<font color="yellow">there are customers
going in and out of here,</font>

564
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:05,436
<font color="yellow">so it's pretty noisy.
Wouldn't that bother your studies?</font>

565
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:07,631
<font color="yellow">That's why I bought you
a pass to a study room.</font>

566
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,354
<font color="yellow">A quiet and safe study room.</font>

567
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:13,704
<font color="yellow">How about you go over there and study?</font>

568
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:17,908
<font color="yellow">No. I study much better here.
You can return the pass to the study room.</font>

569
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,577
<font color="yellow">Don't make eye-contact with each other.</font>

570
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:30,573
<font color="yellow">I hope the two of you will quickly go back
to an employee-employer relationship.</font>

571
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,681
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, this won't do.</font>

572
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:44,835
<font color="yellow">Let's come up with a plan after work.</font>

573
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:49,759
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

574
00:39:50,064 --> 00:39:51,331
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

575
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:54,636
<font color="yellow">Father, don't make any dinner plans today.</font>

576
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:58,905
<font color="yellow">Grandmother wants us to come home early
since she's making braised spicy seafood.</font>

577
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,954
<font color="yellow">- Come out.
- Okay.</font>

578
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:25,862
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, I'm hitting the card really hard,
but why isn't it flipping over?</font>

579
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:29,863
<font color="yellow">I think it's because our card is really weak.</font>

580
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,595
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

581
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:36,525
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, we lost all of
our cards to Jung-won today.</font>

582
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:40,126
<font color="yellow">It's so unfair that I don't think
I'll be able to fall asleep tonight.</font>

583
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:45,081
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Yoo-jin. I'll go home
and make stronger cards tonight.</font>

584
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,436
<font color="yellow">Do you have the paper to make strong cards?</font>

585
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:50,916
<font color="yellow">Yes. I have plenty of strong paper at home.</font>

586
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:52,097
<font color="yellow">Count on me.</font>

587
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:55,290
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's win against Jung-won tomorrow.</font>

588
00:40:55,468 --> 00:41:00,097
<font color="yellow">Okay. One day, if we try hard,
we'll be able to win many cards.</font>

589
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:03,455
<font color="yellow">All right. Make plenty
of strong cards at home.</font>

590
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:04,689
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

591
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:19,157
<font color="yellow">(We are looking for someone)</font>

592
00:41:21,556 --> 00:41:22,977
<font color="yellow">Dad, sit here.</font>

593
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,720
<font color="yellow">Are you okay now? Are you feeling better?</font>

594
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:32,876
<font color="yellow">No, I'm still sick.</font>

595
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,352
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I'm sick?</font>

596
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:39,400
<font color="yellow">Of course. You told me earlier.
You said you were sick because</font>

597
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:42,375
<font color="yellow">you had gotten upset
when I had suddenly disappeared.</font>

598
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:43,884
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

599
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:48,400
<font color="yellow">And I'm also sick because
you keep saying whimsical things.</font>

600
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:51,673
<font color="yellow">Whimsical things? Like what?</font>

601
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,204
<font color="yellow">When did I tell you that we were
going to have a surprise party?</font>

602
00:41:56,173 --> 00:41:59,367
<font color="yellow">You did say that. That's what you said.</font>

603
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,907
<font color="yellow">You told me to sneak out so we
can prepare father's surprise party.</font>

604
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:05,176
<font color="yellow">See? You're lying right now, too.</font>

605
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:09,038
<font color="yellow">No. You're just saying
nonsense because you're ill.</font>

606
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:11,746
<font color="yellow">No! You really said that!</font>

607
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:16,683
<font color="yellow">You just imagined eating
that dumpling. It's not real.</font>

608
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:20,977
<font color="yellow">You imagined being kidnapped
and cleaning up cow dung.</font>

609
00:42:21,524 --> 00:42:24,205
<font color="yellow">Something is wrong with your head.
It's all just your imagination.</font>

610
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,896
<font color="yellow">You're just making it up,
like a cartoon movie.</font>

611
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,415
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

612
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,889
<font color="yellow">No. It's real.</font>

613
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,712
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

614
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,189
<font color="yellow">If you keep saying weird things
and making up stories,</font>

615
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:44,397
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell grandfather
to lock you up in the hospital!</font>

616
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:49,188
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, what's wrong?</font>

617
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,302
<font color="yellow">You're my daughter.</font>

618
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:56,813
<font color="yellow">How can you be like this to your father?</font>

619
00:42:58,844 --> 00:42:59,977
<font color="yellow">So disrespectful.</font>

620
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:03,569
<font color="yellow">So stop giving me a hard time!</font>

621
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,399
<font color="yellow">Stop saying strange things!</font>

622
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,126
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

623
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,274
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to answer me?</font>

624
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:11,587
<font color="yellow">I got it...</font>

625
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:18,340
<font color="yellow">I dare you to tell grandfather
or anyone else I said this to you.</font>

626
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:20,438
<font color="yellow">I'll get you then!</font>

627
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:22,611
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

628
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,976
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to answer me?</font>

629
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:27,032
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

630
00:43:29,017 --> 00:43:34,345
<font color="yellow">- What are you two talking about?
- Hee-dong!</font>

631
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:37,431
<font color="yellow">Yes, father. What is it?</font>

632
00:43:38,673 --> 00:43:39,813
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

633
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:43,265
<font color="yellow">I was scolding him to
not go outside by himself.</font>

634
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,089
<font color="yellow">Go downstairs, dad.</font>

635
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,977
<font color="yellow">Don't forget what I said. Got it?</font>

636
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:00,556
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae,</font>

637
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,271
<font color="yellow">did you get angry at your father?</font>

638
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:05,931
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

639
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:09,056
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset because of him.</font>

640
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,851
<font color="yellow">He keeps saying strange and whimsical things!</font>

641
00:44:14,673 --> 00:44:16,446
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I should do about him.</font>

642
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,063
<font color="yellow">"Frailty, thy name is woman!"</font>

643
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:35,853
<font color="yellow">"To be or not to be! That is the question!"</font>

644
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:43,245
<font color="yellow">"Do you think all of you are so smart?
The soldiers will cut your heads off!"</font>

645
00:44:48,556 --> 00:44:49,556
<font color="yellow">"Oh, my love."</font>

646
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:53,621
<font color="yellow">"Oh, my love! Juliet!"</font>

647
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:01,407
<font color="yellow">Song Joo-ri! Joo-ri!</font>

648
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:03,212
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri!</font>

649
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:05,259
<font color="yellow">Song Joo-ri!</font>

650
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,548
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri, why are you running away?</font>

651
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:15,400
<font color="yellow">I wasn't running away. I have to go
home quickly. I was just going my way.</font>

652
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:22,485
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

653
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:27,667
<font color="yellow">My friend lives around here.</font>

654
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,048
<font color="yellow">I saw you coincidentally while I was
on my way home after meeting her.</font>

655
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,233
<font color="yellow">But what's the point of meeting up?</font>

656
00:45:35,665 --> 00:45:37,329
<font color="yellow">We have nothing to say to each other.</font>

657
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:41,077
<font color="yellow">That's why I was going
to just ignore you. Really.</font>

658
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,298
<font color="yellow">What about the kids? Are they doing well?</font>

659
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:47,399
<font color="yellow">Yes, they're doing well.</font>

660
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,454
<font color="yellow">What about your husband?</font>

661
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:56,832
<font color="yellow">He's doing well, of course.</font>

662
00:45:58,113 --> 00:46:00,980
<font color="yellow">What about you? Are you doing well, too?</font>

663
00:46:02,317 --> 00:46:06,918
<font color="yellow">Of course I am. There's no reason
I wouldn't be doing well.</font>

664
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

665
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:12,324
<font color="yellow">As long as you're doing well, it's fine.</font>

666
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:15,918
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

667
00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:18,199
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

668
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,441
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, I hope you'll be happy, too.</font>

669
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,941
<font color="yellow">Hi. It's me, Jang-soo.</font>

670
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,005
<font color="yellow">You said you know Joo-ri's friend, right?</font>

671
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,333
<font color="yellow">Find out how Joo-ri is doing lately.</font>

672
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:10,285
<font color="yellow">Yes. Help me out.</font>

673
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:17,277
<font color="yellow">Did you just come home?</font>

674
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:19,928
<font color="yellow">Yes. I had plans with my friends.
It's been a while</font>

675
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:22,325
<font color="yellow">since I met them,
so I went shopping with them.</font>

676
00:47:23,543 --> 00:47:24,933
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's been a while.</font>

677
00:47:25,457 --> 00:47:28,863
<font color="yellow">You've been coming home late these days
because you're hanging out with your friends.</font>

678
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:29,888
<font color="yellow">I have?</font>

679
00:47:30,177 --> 00:47:32,668
<font color="yellow">Some days I'm late. Some days I'm not.</font>

680
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:38,893
<font color="yellow">Now that Mi-poong isn't around, can you
come home earlier and help out my mom a bit?</font>

681
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:42,550
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, do you think
I've been playing around all this time?</font>

682
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:46,770
<font color="yellow">I've been working all day long.
It's been a while</font>

683
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:49,144
<font color="yellow">since I saw my friends, so I ate
dinner and had coffee with them.</font>

684
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,836
<font color="yellow">Are you that unhappy with it?</font>

685
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,707
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I'm unhappy with it.</font>

686
00:47:53,902 --> 00:47:56,574
<font color="yellow">I just feel bad for my mom because
you're always late these days.</font>

687
00:47:56,722 --> 00:48:00,215
<font color="yellow">If you feel that bad for her,
you can help her out then!</font>

688
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,981
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wash up,
so go ahead and sleep first!</font>

689
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:18,043
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

690
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:21,308
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep?</font>

691
00:48:27,683 --> 00:48:28,699
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

692
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,223
<font color="yellow">I'm really curious about something.</font>

693
00:48:35,254 --> 00:48:36,483
<font color="yellow">Curious?</font>

694
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:38,996
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

695
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:42,707
<font color="yellow">About Shin-ae...</font>

696
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:47,354
<font color="yellow">Is she really my daughter?</font>

697
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:53,496
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's really your daughter.</font>

698
00:48:54,605 --> 00:48:56,373
<font color="yellow">Were you worried about that?</font>

699
00:48:58,254 --> 00:48:59,254
<font color="yellow">But father...</font>

700
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:03,748
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae doesn't feel like my daughter.</font>

701
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,434
<font color="yellow">Do you still feel that way?</font>

702
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,062
<font color="yellow">I think that's because your memory
hasn't returned yet.</font>

703
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,287
<font color="yellow">I don't that's it, father.</font>

704
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:21,948
<font color="yellow">When I'm with you,
I feel comfortable and happy.</font>

705
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:26,839
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of Shin-ae though.</font>

706
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:31,168
<font color="yellow">You're scared of Shin-ae?</font>

707
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:35,027
<font color="yellow">She keeps saying that I'm lying.</font>

708
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:41,707
<font color="yellow">- She keeps getting mad at me, too.
- Shin-ae got mad at you?</font>

709
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:47,310
<font color="yellow">She said she'll get me if I told you this.</font>

710
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,636
<font color="yellow">She said she would send me
to the hospital, father.</font>

711
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:58,088
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm really scared of her, father.</font>

712
00:49:59,238 --> 00:50:02,191
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae really said that?</font>

713
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:04,935
<font color="yellow">Yes, she really did.</font>

714
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,169
<font color="yellow">So I'm really scared of her father.</font>

715
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:07,898
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Did Mr. Kim
just go up to see Dal-ho?</font>

716
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,265
<font color="yellow">Why now?</font>

717
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:17,077
<font color="yellow">Why is he going up at this hour?
What's going on?</font>

718
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:23,881
<font color="yellow">What brings you up here?</font>

719
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:26,836
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

720
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:28,601
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Kim.</font>

721
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:32,707
<font color="yellow">About Shin-ae...</font>

722
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:38,634
<font color="yellow">Last time, I couldn't check on her because
doing a DNA test with her was impossible,</font>

723
00:51:40,482 --> 00:51:46,036
<font color="yellow">but wouldn't it be possible for Shin-ae
and Dae-hoon to get a DNA test now?</font>

724
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:49,526
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course. Fathers
and daughters can be tested.</font>

725
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:51,193
<font color="yellow">Then Dal-ho...</font>

726
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:57,072
<font color="yellow">I think Shin-ae and Dae-hoon
should get a DNA test.</font>

727
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:00,329
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

728
00:52:01,122 --> 00:52:06,802
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to run the test
without Shin-ae knowing about it.</font>

729
00:52:07,368 --> 00:52:09,101
<font color="yellow">That's why I came up here.</font>

730
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:12,194
<font color="yellow">You're the only one
who I can discuss this with.</font>

731
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,440
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Mr. Kim.</font>

732
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:18,973
<font color="yellow">When Shin-ae goes to work tomorrow,
I'll get her toothbrush</font>

733
00:52:18,998 --> 00:52:21,867
<font color="yellow">and Dae-hoon's toothbrush
and take them for DNA testing.</font>

734
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,829
