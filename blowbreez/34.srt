00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,031
<font color="yellow">- (Episode 34)<br>- Explain!</font>

2
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:11,518
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

3
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:16,462
<font color="yellow">If you have a mouth, explain yourself.<br>Will you still deny it?</font>

4
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:21,761
<font color="yellow">Stop the nonsense and<br>come back home this instant!</font>

5
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:23,776
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim,</font>

6
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:26,406
<font color="yellow">I can't come home.</font>

7
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,310
<font color="yellow">I can't live with her anymore.</font>

8
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,948
<font color="yellow">What? You can't live with me?</font>

9
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,113
<font color="yellow">Then are you going to live with her?</font>

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:43,056
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim, just hear the way<br>he talks! It's so unfair!
- Chung-ja, stay still!</font>

11
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:53,705
<font color="yellow">How dare you be irresponsible and say<br>that you can't live with her so easily?</font>

12
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:57,366
<font color="yellow">I have no desire to live<br>with a rude person like her.</font>

13
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,747
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.</font>

14
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:03,612
<font color="yellow">What? A rude person?</font>

15
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,909
<font color="yellow">He's the one who's being rude!</font>

16
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:23,034
<font color="yellow">I thought this woman was gentle.</font>

17
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:26,073
<font color="yellow">She's a terrible one!</font>

18
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:30,437
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?<br>You made the house into a mess!</font>

19
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:33,032
<font color="yellow">Do you think running away will solve anything?</font>

20
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,433
<font color="yellow">I'll call you soon. We'll meet at court.</font>

21
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:37,901
<font color="yellow">What? Court?</font>

22
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:41,309
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to meet at court?</font>

23
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:45,564
<font color="yellow">I did nothing wrong! All I did was<br>have our kids and raise them!</font>

24
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,323
<font color="yellow">You did nothing wrong?</font>

25
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,463
<font color="yellow">Do you even think of me as<br>your husband? Is that why you hired</font>

26
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,050
<font color="yellow">someone to tail me and take photos<br>of me? Why would you do that?</font>

27
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:59,645
<font color="yellow">So what did you find out?<br>What did I do? You tell me!</font>

28
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:02,228
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

29
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:03,252
<font color="yellow">Look here!</font>

30
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,981
<font color="yellow">Was Chung-ja the one who had an affair?<br>You get angry at others for your mistakes!</font>

31
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,436
<font color="yellow">You should be begging for<br>forgiveness on your knees! How dare you</font>

32
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:16,143
<font color="yellow">raise your voice at her!<br>Are you still going to deny this?</font>

33
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,058
<font color="yellow">- You little...<br>- Jo Dal-ho!</font>

34
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:29,777
<font color="yellow">- What do I do?<br>- My goodness! I'm so upset!</font>

35
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:34,994
<font color="yellow">But who sent you these pictures?</font>

36
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:39,025
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, did you really<br>hire someone to take these?</font>

37
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:43,091
<font color="yellow">I didn't do this. I wonder who did it.</font>

38
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:54,664
<font color="yellow">Did you take these photos?</font>

39
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,665
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,664
<font color="yellow">I was so upset that people<br>misunderstood you as having</font>

41
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,829
<font color="yellow">delusional suspicion of<br>your husband's faithfulness.</font>

42
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:07,969
<font color="yellow">But I think I made a mistake. Father was<br>so angry when he left. What will we do now?</font>

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,625
<font color="yellow">No, no. You did the right thing.</font>

44
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:14,656
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for you, I would've<br>continued to be a mental patient.</font>

45
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:18,736
<font color="yellow">You did the right thing by<br>proving I'm a sane person.</font>

46
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:22,283
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Shin-ae. You did the right thing.</font>

47
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:28,267
<font color="yellow">Mother, are you going to just let this slide?</font>

48
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,025
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

49
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,563
<font color="yellow">You should barge into<br>Mi-poong's house with your friends.</font>

50
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,886
<font color="yellow">Show them these photos<br>and turn that house upside down.</font>

51
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,032
<font color="yellow">Make sure they can't live in that<br>neighborhood without any shame.</font>

52
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,680
<font color="yellow">You're right. I have these photos as proof.</font>

53
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:49,964
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make sure to<br>chase them out of Geum-sil's house</font>

54
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,534
<font color="yellow">so that they can't come near us ever again.</font>

55
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:04,940
<font color="yellow">- What are these?<br>- Can't you tell?</font>

56
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,601
<font color="yellow">So your husband really cheated on you?</font>

57
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:13,945
<font color="yellow">It's so unfair.</font>

58
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:19,851
<font color="yellow">Soon-jung, I'm about to lose<br>my husband to a fox, just like you did.</font>

59
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:23,765
<font color="yellow">- What am I supposed to do?<br>- What else?</font>

60
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,469
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Chung-ja, lead the way.</font>

61
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:32,719
<font color="yellow">- Go where?<br>- Evil home-wreckers like her must be crushed!</font>

62
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:36,902
<font color="yellow">What are you guys doing?<br>She's about to lose her husband!</font>

63
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,429
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, let's go.<br>- Okay, let's go.</font>

64
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,447
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

65
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:48,140
<font color="yellow">Get up and eat this<br>so that you can feel better.</font>

66
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:52,452
<font color="yellow">I feel nauseous!</font>

67
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:55,969
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink in the first place?</font>

68
00:04:56,258 --> 00:05:00,078
<font color="yellow">Why would you do something<br>you've never done before at this age?</font>

69
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:01,837
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

70
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:06,399
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Serves you right.</font>

71
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:08,813
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to go to work?</font>

72
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,548
<font color="yellow">I'm really going to quit.</font>

73
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,921
<font color="yellow">Oh, be quiet!</font>

74
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,936
<font color="yellow">Where else will you get such<br>a comfortable job at your age?</font>

75
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,289
<font color="yellow">Just go!</font>

76
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:21,703
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim said he likes Geum-sil!</font>

77
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,304
<font color="yellow">Do you still want me to go?</font>

78
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:27,486
<font color="yellow">Your boss likes Geum-sil?</font>

79
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:31,609
<font color="yellow">Father, why isn't Nam-yi here again?</font>

80
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,313
<font color="yellow">Did you nag her again?</font>

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,298
<font color="yellow">No. Nam-yi is sick.</font>

82
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,296
<font color="yellow">She's sick? How is she sick?</font>

83
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,774
<font color="yellow">Hello, ma'am.</font>

84
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:45,164
<font color="yellow">- Hi.<br>- Hello.</font>

85
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:48,169
<font color="yellow">- Hi.<br>- Is Nam-yi very sick?</font>

86
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,178
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is.</font>

87
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:51,486
<font color="yellow">Did she go to the hospital?</font>

88
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,780
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, I came to talk to your father.</font>

89
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,234
<font color="yellow">Can you go outside for a moment?</font>

90
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,094
<font color="yellow">- Sure. Please tell Nam-yi to get well soon.<br>- I will.</font>

91
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,738
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat.</font>

92
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,712
<font color="yellow">How is Nam-yi sick?</font>

93
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,899
<font color="yellow">She was fine yesterday,<br>but she suddenly said she was sick.</font>

94
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,150
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

95
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:20,943
<font color="yellow">I came because I wanted to ask you something.</font>

96
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,695
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, do you like my daughter-in-law?</font>

97
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,203
<font color="yellow">Yes, I like her.</font>

98
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:33,327
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I didn't think you were that kind</font>

99
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:36,275
<font color="yellow">of person. Do you think this makes any sense?</font>

100
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,820
<font color="yellow">Is it wrong for me to like Geum-sil?</font>

101
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:44,695
<font color="yellow">She resembles my biological sister.<br>That's why I like her.</font>

102
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:51,171
<font color="yellow">So you like her as a sister<br>and not as a woman?</font>

103
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:55,359
<font color="yellow">After my parents passed away early,<br>my sister took care of me like I was her own son.</font>

104
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,779
<font color="yellow">She passed away before she could<br>see me succeed, and that broke my heart.</font>

105
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,743
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to see<br>my sister, but Ms. Hwang</font>

106
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:07,296
<font color="yellow">resembles her a lot,<br>so I was happy to just see her.</font>

107
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:11,453
<font color="yellow">So you really like her as a sister?</font>

108
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:16,032
<font color="yellow">Yes. However, I can end up<br>liking her as a woman.</font>

109
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:18,020
<font color="yellow">Oh, you can't do that!</font>

110
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:22,102
<font color="yellow">Don't even say that!<br>Just like her as a sister!</font>

111
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:28,739
<font color="yellow">Do you know the age gap<br>between you and Geum-sil?</font>

112
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:33,712
<font color="yellow">Men and women must meet<br>people near their own age.</font>

113
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:37,688
<font color="yellow">When there's a huge age gap,<br>life gets very difficult.</font>

114
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:41,952
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't meet older women.<br>Find someone your own age.</font>

115
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46,578
<font color="yellow">If you look around you, you'll be<br>able to find a woman around your age.</font>

116
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:50,500
<font color="yellow">Why would you look for an older woman?</font>

117
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,330
<font color="yellow">Who are you talking about?</font>

118
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:59,361
<font color="yellow">Someone near you.<br>Someone you'll be able to meet every day.</font>

119
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:05,287
<font color="yellow">When you think about those things,<br>someone will pop into your mind automatically.</font>

120
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,789
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

121
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:13,402
<font color="yellow">Fermented soybean paste.</font>

122
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:17,299
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law made it. If you just put</font>

123
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,179
<font color="yellow">kimchi and tofu in there, it'll be delicious.</font>

124
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:23,674
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you! I'll enjoy it.</font>

125
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,570
<font color="yellow">But did you come here just for this?</font>

126
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,320
<font color="yellow">I had some time before I had<br>to go to work in the afternoon,</font>

127
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,774
<font color="yellow">and I had something to tell you, too.</font>

128
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,323
<font color="yellow">Something to tell me?</font>

129
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,117
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

130
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:39,399
<font color="yellow">It's about Mr. Jo's wife.</font>

131
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,846
<font color="yellow">She's not allowed to come to Deokcheonok.</font>

132
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,406
<font color="yellow">She can't come anywhere near there anymore.</font>

133
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:53,039
<font color="yellow">We told Mr. Kim everything<br>she had done to you.</font>

134
00:08:54,232 --> 00:09:00,303
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim was so furious!<br>I bet Ms. Ma was scolded very badly!</font>

135
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:03,857
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

136
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:10,693
<font color="yellow">So come back to Deokcheonok.<br>I came to tell you that.</font>

137
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:17,499
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'm very grateful...</font>

138
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:23,029
<font color="yellow">but I don't think it would be right<br>for me to return to Deokcheonok.</font>

139
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:27,654
<font color="yellow">- Where is this horrid wench?<br>- Hwang Geum-sil, you come out here, too!</font>

140
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,169
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

141
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,928
<font color="yellow">- Is it here?<br>- Break everything!</font>

142
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:34,685
<font color="yellow">Break everything!</font>

143
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,225
<font color="yellow">- You horrible wench!<br>- Why are you doing this?</font>

144
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,894
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

145
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:44,756
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

146
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,563
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting in the way?</font>

147
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:09,709
<font color="yellow">Stop, everyone! That's enough!</font>

148
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,684
<font color="yellow">How dare you barge into someone else's<br>home and do something so shameful!</font>

149
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:16,271
<font color="yellow">Get out, all of you!</font>

150
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:22,500
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, are you crazy? Young-soon and<br>Soon-jung, why are you guys doing this, too?</font>

151
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:25,860
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja is abnormal!</font>

152
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:29,861
<font color="yellow">How can you not stop her from<br>doing this? Are you guys insane?</font>

153
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:34,490
<font color="yellow">Hwang Geum-sil, are you taking<br>her side because she's your in-law?</font>

154
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:37,874
<font color="yellow">Look at these before you speak!</font>

155
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,803
<font color="yellow">- What's this?<br>- Here. Look.</font>

156
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,937
<font color="yellow">What are these? My goodness.</font>

157
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,193
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

158
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:52,991
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

159
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:04,100
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

160
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,019
<font color="yellow">It's as you see them!</font>

161
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:09,183
<font color="yellow">This woman seduced Chung-ja's<br>husband and had an affair with him!</font>

162
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:10,374
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

163
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:15,760
<font color="yellow">How can you live with your daughter-in-law<br>whose mother is a home-wrecker?</font>

164
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,102
<font color="yellow">It's not true!</font>

165
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:24,725
<font color="yellow">No! This isn't true! It's not!</font>

166
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:30,348
<font color="yellow">All of you, get out of here! Get out!</font>

167
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:33,611
<font color="yellow">- Get out!<br>- It's not true!</font>

168
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:54,380
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. What on earth is going on?</font>

169
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:58,323
<font color="yellow">Why would she cry when I'm the one<br>who should be crying? Hwang Geum-sil!</font>

170
00:11:58,702 --> 00:12:01,068
<font color="yellow">If you still live with<br>that woman and her daughter,</font>

171
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:03,741
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take Hee-ra out of here.</font>

172
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,898
<font color="yellow">And I won't see you ever again either!</font>

173
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:10,414
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, now that Geum-sil knows,<br>she'll do something about it. Let's go.</font>

174
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:13,845
<font color="yellow">You better not tell Hee-ra about this.</font>

175
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,294
<font color="yellow">Or else I'll die!</font>

176
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,495
<font color="yellow">Hey Hwang Geum-sil,<br>you better get your head together!</font>

177
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,232
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

178
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,685
<font color="yellow">But why did the hospital diagnose her<br>as having delusional suspicion?</font>

179
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:49,500
<font color="yellow">You know blood pressure can<br>temporarily rise if you get excited.</font>

180
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:54,702
<font color="yellow">She was doubtful of her husband then,<br>which is why she got that diagnosis.</font>

181
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:58,919
<font color="yellow">But Ms. Joo really looked like<br>she was in an unfair position.</font>

182
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,178
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

183
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,130
<font color="yellow">What if something went wrong?</font>

184
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,446
<font color="yellow">What if they were at a push-and-pull<br>stage and got misunderstood?</font>

185
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:10,054
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

186
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:15,092
<font color="yellow">They're not going out, but they<br>might have feelings for each other.</font>

187
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:23,160
<font color="yellow">Then you should just phrase it that way!<br>Why do you have to speak in such weird terms?</font>

188
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,685
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

189
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:55,429
<font color="yellow">Out of all people, it just has<br>to be with my friend's husband.</font>

190
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,866
<font color="yellow">Out of all people, it just has to be<br>with your sister-in-law's father.</font>

191
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:03,896
<font color="yellow">I hate the fact that<br>you're my daughter-in-law!</font>

192
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,303
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

193
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:08,928
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

194
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,249
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

195
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,067
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Did something happen?</font>

196
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,898
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

197
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:24,077
<font color="yellow">You left Ha-yeon behind to get married<br>to the daughter of an adulteress?</font>

198
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,028
<font color="yellow">Even if you choose a woman<br>with your eyes closed,</font>

199
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:28,938
<font color="yellow">you'll choose a better woman than this one!</font>

200
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,419
<font color="yellow">Grandma. Aunt.</font>

201
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:39,506
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with mom?</font>

202
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,428
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

203
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:29,560
<font color="yellow">Mom, what happened?</font>

204
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:37,038
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here? I don't<br>want you to see this. Go back home.</font>

205
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,178
<font color="yellow">I need to go pick up Yoo-sung.</font>

206
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:44,150
<font color="yellow">Jang-go went to pick him up.</font>

207
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,053
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you stupid?</font>

208
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,222
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you do anything while they destroyed<br>your house? What did you do so wrong?</font>

209
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,487
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

210
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,002
<font color="yellow">let me ask you something. Be honest with me.</font>

211
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:05,066
<font color="yellow">Mom, do you have feelings for Mr. Jo?</font>

212
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:09,691
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what are you talking about?</font>

213
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,355
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo is a married man.</font>

214
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:15,712
<font color="yellow">It's not like that at all.</font>

215
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:20,441
<font color="yellow">Mom, I don't care what others say.</font>

216
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,720
<font color="yellow">I'm only going to believe what you tell me.</font>

217
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,635
<font color="yellow">Even if you tell me that you do<br>have feelings for him, I won't bash you.</font>

218
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:33,044
<font color="yellow">I'm going to try to understand you<br>because you're my mom.</font>

219
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:37,010
<font color="yellow">No, Mi-poong, I didn’t.</font>

220
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,765
<font color="yellow">Then what are those photos?</font>

221
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,329
<font color="yellow">Did you see them, too?</font>

222
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,699
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

223
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:55,083
<font color="yellow">I injured my hand because<br>Mr. Jo's wife pushed me.</font>

224
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,283
<font color="yellow">After I came out from surgery, I was so</font>

225
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:03,510
<font color="yellow">bewildered and frustrated<br>that I started to cry.</font>

226
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:05,997
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

227
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:10,685
<font color="yellow">I wanted to rely on anyone then.</font>

228
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:14,834
<font color="yellow">I would've held onto anyone<br>at that moment and cried.</font>

229
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,746
<font color="yellow">That's how I felt back then.</font>

230
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:24,707
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo apologized and said it was<br>his fault that my hand became this way.</font>

231
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:28,038
<font color="yellow">He wanted to apologize on behalf of his wife.</font>

232
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:33,519
<font color="yellow">That's why I was holding onto him and crying.</font>

233
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,592
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

234
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:45,413
<font color="yellow">if not for you and Yoo-sung...</font>

235
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,075
<font color="yellow">I want to die.</font>

236
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:54,474
<font color="yellow">- Mom...<br>- How can I live in such a cruel world?</font>

237
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:59,957
<font color="yellow">You did nothing wrong. Why would<br>you die? Why would you say that?</font>

238
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:04,987
<font color="yellow">Why do people believe her and not me?</font>

239
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,336
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm a poor<br>North Korean defector?</font>

240
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,526
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm a widow?</font>

241
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:12,810
<font color="yellow">Why is no one believing me?</font>

242
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:17,964
<font color="yellow">I feel like that's so unfair.</font>

243
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,685
<font color="yellow">I believe you.</font>

244
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,035
<font color="yellow">I'll believe you.</font>

245
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:49,855
<font color="yellow">Mother, my mom is not in any<br>relationship with Mr. Jo. I just asked her.</font>

246
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:56,198
<font color="yellow">Then what about those photos<br>of them hugging and holding hands?</font>

247
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:58,078
<font color="yellow">Is that another person?</font>

248
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:01,216
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened in there either.</font>

249
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,127
<font color="yellow">However, it's not true.</font>

250
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,144
<font color="yellow">You don't know? But it's not true?</font>

251
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:10,810
<font color="yellow">How stubborn. Like mother, like daughter.</font>

252
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:13,421
<font color="yellow">My mom doesn't lie to me.</font>

253
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,209
<font color="yellow">Please believe my mom's innocence.</font>

254
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:19,578
<font color="yellow">If she did something wrong,<br>she should acknowledge it and beg</font>

255
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:22,670
<font color="yellow">for forgiveness. At least I would<br>think she was a human being then.</font>

256
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,110
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. I'm too scared to<br>live with you and your mom.</font>

257
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:31,987
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, aren't you being too harsh?</font>

258
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:34,341
<font color="yellow">I'm being harsh?</font>

259
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,361
<font color="yellow">To be frank, we're both widows.</font>

260
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:40,199
<font color="yellow">Widows know widows.</font>

261
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,263
<font color="yellow">Widows can date other men.</font>

262
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:45,814
<font color="yellow">But how can she date a married man?</font>

263
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:47,744
<font color="yellow">That's just wrong.</font>

264
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:52,755
<font color="yellow">- You shouldn't make others miserable!<br>- My mom is not that kind of person!</font>

265
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:59,092
<font color="yellow">I hate it that you're arguing about<br>this even if the evidence is right there!</font>

266
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,802
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I can't live with either of you.</font>

267
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,896
<font color="yellow">So either you divorce Jang-go,</font>

268
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:11,371
<font color="yellow">or if you can't do that, take<br>your family out of here. I'm begging you.</font>

269
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:13,284
<font color="yellow">You're being too much.</font>

270
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:16,027
<font color="yellow">Can't you believe her just this once?</font>

271
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:18,766
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep telling me to believe her?</font>

272
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:24,288
<font color="yellow">This is so humiliating!</font>

273
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,383
<font color="yellow">Because of you two, I can't even eat!</font>

274
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:44,552
<font color="yellow">My mom is not that kind of person.</font>

275
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:49,255
<font color="yellow">Please believe her! Grandma! Mother! Aunt!</font>

276
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,224
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I examined the photos,</font>

277
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:29,876
<font color="yellow">and it seems like someone<br>was tailing them to take</font>

278
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,053
<font color="yellow">photos of them only when<br>they were closely together.</font>

279
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,717
<font color="yellow">The camera was angled so that<br>they would look close to each other.</font>

280
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:40,169
<font color="yellow">If someone was trying to trap them,<br>then they couldn't help but fall for it.</font>

281
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:44,900
<font color="yellow">Whoever took those photos<br>is a horrible person!</font>

282
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:48,300
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, stop crying.</font>

283
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:53,255
<font color="yellow">Your mother must be having a hard time.<br>We should help her out, don't you think?</font>

284
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,653
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'm not going to cry.</font>

285
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:04,540
<font color="yellow">- You believe me, don't you?<br>- Of course I believe you!</font>

286
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:08,272
<font color="yellow">Even if you say adzuki beans are<br>soybeans, I'll believe you. Even if you say</font>

287
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:11,278
<font color="yellow">you could make fermented soybeans<br>out of adzuki beans, I'll believe you.</font>

288
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,653
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- When did I say adzuki beans are soybeans?</font>

289
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,157
<font color="yellow">I said adzuki beans are adzuki beans!</font>

294
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:29,755
<font color="yellow">Okay, go ahead.</font>

301
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:01,543

<font color="yellow">Is she okay?</font>

326
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:39,198
<font color="yellow">Why would you worry if she's sick or not?</font>

00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:57,144
<font color="yellow">Because of you, my mom<br>was humiliated as a woman.</font>

<font color="yellow">Because your actions.</font>

331

<font color="yellow">Hi, honey. It's me.</font>

343
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:23,652
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

344
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,684
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll come out right now.</font>

348
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:49,516
<font color="yellow">Did Dal-ho call you out because<br>he wants you to sign the divorce papers?</font>

349
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,149
<font color="yellow">What? No way.</font>

350
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:17,037
<font color="yellow">Even if you want me to sign<br>the divorce papers, it won't work.</font>

351
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:20,624
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die than divorce you.</font>

352
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:28,101
<font color="yellow">I heard you went to Ms. Joo's house today.</font>

353
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:35,163
<font color="yellow">What? Did you meet her again?</font>

354
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:40,139
<font color="yellow">Did she tell you that I destroyed her house?</font>

355
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,103
<font color="yellow">Did you call me out to scold me for that?</font>

356
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:47,527
<font color="yellow">How can you go to her house<br>and do such a thing?</font>

357
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:49,283
<font color="yellow">What? "Such a thing?"</font>

358
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:54,082
<font color="yellow">You barged into an innocent<br>person's house and wrecked havoc.</font>

359
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,564
<font color="yellow">Do you think you did the right thing?</font>

360
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,220
<font color="yellow">She's innocent?</font>

361
00:28:59,014 --> 00:29:02,384
<font color="yellow">I'm still alive!</font>

362
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,378
<font color="yellow">Should I do nothing when<br>she seduces my husband?</font>

363
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,275
<font color="yellow">She hugged you,<br>held your hand, and smiled at you.</font>

364
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,767
<font color="yellow">But she's innocent?</font>

365
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:14,445
<font color="yellow">I hugged her!</font>

366
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:17,522
<font color="yellow">I held her hand! I looked at her!</font>

367
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:21,272
<font color="yellow">Don't you have eyes?<br>Can't you tell from the photos?</font>

368
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,282
<font color="yellow">That woman didn't do anything! I did it!</font>

369
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:26,511
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

370
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:28,642
<font color="yellow">I felt bad for her.</font>

371
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:32,556
<font color="yellow">I felt bad that she had to<br>play your punching bag.</font>

372
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:35,530
<font color="yellow">What did she do so wrong for you<br>to make her suffer this way?</font>

373
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:39,190
<font color="yellow">I met her so that I could<br>apologize on your behalf.</font>

374
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,251
<font color="yellow">I met her to take her to the<br>hospital on your behalf.</font>

375
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:45,819
<font color="yellow">Don't lie.</font>

376
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:48,332
<font color="yellow">Then why did you leave home?</font>

377
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:52,786
<font color="yellow">Didn't you leave because of her?<br>Because you're going to live with her?</font>

378
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:56,295
<font color="yellow">I left home because of you.<br>Not because of Ms. Joo.</font>

379
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,546
<font color="yellow">So don't bother her anymore.</font>

380
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:03,792
<font color="yellow">If you bother her again...</font>

381
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,829
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive you.</font>

382
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:14,334
<font color="yellow">Did you call me out at this hour<br>just so you can tell me this?</font>

383
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,670
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

384
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:25,486
<font color="yellow">If you come home,<br>I'll believe everything you just told me.</font>

385
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:32,784
<font color="yellow">But if you don't come home,<br>I'll keep going to her house.</font>

386
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:34,631
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

387
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:38,736
<font color="yellow">If you don't come home tonight, I'll go to<br>her house again tomorrow and destroy it!</font>

388
00:30:39,115 --> 00:30:44,209
<font color="yellow">If you don't come home every day,<br>I'm going to torture her every day!</font>

389
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:47,998
<font color="yellow">Why? You think I can't do it?</font>

390
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,994
<font color="yellow">Then just wait and see!</font>

391
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:59,170
<font color="yellow">Then if I come back home,</font>

392
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:03,131
<font color="yellow">will you never go to see her again?</font>

393
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:05,527
<font color="yellow">Can you promise me?</font>

394
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:23,283
<font color="yellow">Good. You did the right thing by coming home.</font>

395
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:26,928
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for creating a commotion.</font>

396
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:32,402
<font color="yellow">Married couples can't always be happy.</font>

397
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:36,115
<font color="yellow">You can be swayed.</font>

398
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,771
<font color="yellow">That's all part of life.</font>

399
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:42,998
<font color="yellow">Still, you shouldn't go down the wrong path.</font>

400
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,076
<font color="yellow">Be careful from now on.</font>

401
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:50,239
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't meet people so carelessly.</font>

402
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:56,381
<font color="yellow">The kids are watching.<br>He won't do that anymore.</font>

403
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,842
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja.<br>- Yes?</font>

404
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:07,278
<font color="yellow">As long as a man's pride as the head of the<br>house isn't damaged, he won't leave home.</font>

405
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:12,865
<font color="yellow">Be careful from now on. Got it?</font>

406
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:14,795
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

407
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,694
<font color="yellow">What's that good smell?</font>

408
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,014
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, are you making loach soup?</font>

409
00:32:30,476 --> 00:32:33,508
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho wouldn't have eaten well while he was</font>

410
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,632
<font color="yellow">staying at the office. That's why I made this.</font>

411
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:40,983
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What a faithful woman you are!</font>

412
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,629
<font color="yellow">If it was me, I wouldn't even want<br>to give him a bowl of cold rice!</font>

413
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:50,959
<font color="yellow">Why would you serve loach soup to<br>your unfaithful husband? My goodness!</font>

414
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:53,662
<font color="yellow">- Don't eat it then!<br>- We're back!</font>

415
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:56,613
<font color="yellow">Hello! Did you guys eat dinner?</font>

416
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:59,795
<font color="yellow">Yes. I heard father came back home.</font>

417
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,045
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

418
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:06,734
<font color="yellow">He did come back,<br>but he's in Hee-dong's studio.</font>

419
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,575
<font color="yellow">Tell him to get out of that room.</font>

420
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:11,648
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

421
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,073
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, let's go.</font>

422
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,756
<font color="yellow">- Go on up.<br>- Okay.</font>

423
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,811
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm so happy for you.</font>

424
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,354
<font color="yellow">I know. It's all thanks to you.</font>

425
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:28,294
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Wait a little bit longer.</font>

426
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,861
<font color="yellow">Everything will settle down soon.</font>

427

430
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,170
<font color="yellow">Father, are you drinking?</font>

431
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:57,984
<font color="yellow">Yes. Can I use your room for a few days?</font>

432
00:33:58,937 --> 00:33:59,937
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

433
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,199
<font color="yellow">I'll pour you a drink.</font>

434
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:13,637
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

435
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

436
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:19,715
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

437
00:34:36,856 --> 00:34:39,604
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong.<br>- Are you leaving right now?</font>

438
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:43,434
<font color="yellow">Yes, but I have a meeting, so I won't<br>be able to go to work with you today.</font>

439
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,996
<font color="yellow">I'm okay, so hurry up and go.</font>

440
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:49,606
<font color="yellow">Tie my necktie for me. I have<br>an important meeting today.</font>

441
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:51,332
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

442
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,224
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I can't help you today.</font>

443
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:57,910
<font color="yellow">I told you that you can<br>help me by not helping me.</font>

444
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,793
<font color="yellow">If my mom says something, let it go in<br>one ear and out the other. Okay?</font>

445
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:04,372
<font color="yellow">Cheer up.</font>

446
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:08,816
<font color="yellow">- Done?<br>- Yes.</font>

447
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,291
<font color="yellow">Kiss.</font>

448
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:15,159
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing<br>in the middle of breakfast?</font>

449
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:17,034
<font color="yellow">- Mom.<br>- And in the kitchen, too.</font>

450
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:21,456
<font color="yellow">I asked Mi-poong to tie my necktie for me,<br>since I have an important meeting today.</font>

451
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:24,501
<font color="yellow">When Mi-poong ties my necktie,<br>it's good luck for me.</font>

452
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:38,503
<font color="yellow">- I'm off.<br>- Aren't you going to eat
breakfast before you go?</font>

453
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,269
<font color="yellow">Yes, I have a meeting this morning.<br>Bye, Mi-poong!</font>

454
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,247
<font color="yellow">- Drive safely.<br>- I will.</font>

455
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:49,349
<font color="yellow">- We're off.<br>- You guys are going early, too?
It's not time for the store to open yet.</font>

456
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:51,461
<font color="yellow">I have to arrange the<br>inventory and new products</font>

457
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,443
<font color="yellow">are coming in today, so I have to leave early.</font>

458
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:57,309
<font color="yellow">Mother, I shouldn't<br>have opened up a shop!</font>

459
00:35:57,334 --> 00:36:00,501
<font color="yellow">I can't get enough sleep, and<br>my legs swell up so much!</font>

460
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:04,615
<font color="yellow">That's why I massage your legs every day!</font>

461
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:10,079
<font color="yellow">I know! That's why I hold it in and<br>continue to go to work! All because of you!</font>

462
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:13,986
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my sweetie.<br>- What a load of crap.</font>

463
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:17,568
<font color="yellow">- How lovey-dovey!<br>- Hee-ra, we're going to be late. Bye!</font>

464
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,747
<font color="yellow">You can't go on an empty stomach.<br>Hold on. Drink some milk before you go.</font>

465
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:22,889
<font color="yellow">- We're fine.<br>- We're fine.</font>

466
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:24,869
<font color="yellow">Of course you're not fine.</font>

467
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,769
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Go pour some milk.</font>

468
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,530
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

469
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:32,229
<font color="yellow">We're fine...</font>

470
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:37,454
<font color="yellow">Hold on. At least eat some of this tofu. Here.</font>

471
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:39,135
<font color="yellow">Drink some milk, too.</font>

472
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,329
<font color="yellow">- It's good.<br>- Hurry up! They're running late!</font>

473
00:36:42,354 --> 00:36:44,300
<font color="yellow">- Coming!<br>- Drink some milk before you go.</font>

474
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:46,325
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.<br>- You'll be able to work that way.</font>

475
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,644
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.<br>- Thanks you, mother. Bye.</font>

476
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:54,494
<font color="yellow">- Kiss, kiss! Bye!<br>- Thanks, mom!</font>

477
00:36:57,238 --> 00:37:01,146
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, hurry up and eat<br>so that you can go to work.</font>

478
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,198
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

479
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,305
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

480
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:31,218
<font color="yellow">Did you do something wrong,<br>just like your mother?</font>

481
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:33,566
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

482
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,088
<font color="yellow">Come outside.</font>

483
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:45,941
<font color="yellow">I bought these at the fish market,<br>and they just delivered them.</font>

484
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:51,039
<font color="yellow">Clean the scales and leave them to dry here.</font>

485
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:53,720
<font color="yellow">When they become firm,<br>we'll move them to the freezer.</font>

486
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,925
<font color="yellow">Mother, I have to go to work.</font>

487
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:00,354
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I know that?</font>

488
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:05,997
<font color="yellow">You can just say something<br>came up and go a little later.</font>

489
00:38:06,996 --> 00:38:10,403
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's possible.<br>I have a team meeting in the morning.</font>

490
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:13,289
<font color="yellow">And it's not an emergency either.<br>I can't be late</font>

491
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:15,762
<font color="yellow">just because I have<br>to clean up these fish.</font>

492
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:18,075
<font color="yellow">I'll clean them after I come back from work.</font>

493
00:38:18,903 --> 00:38:24,111
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back to me. If I tell<br>you to do it, you should just do it.</font>

494
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,601
<font color="yellow">- Do my words mean nothing to you?<br>- Of course not.</font>

495
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:30,168
<font color="yellow">I'll do them after I come back from work.</font>

496
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:33,561
<font color="yellow">Then what about these fish?<br>Do you want them to rot?</font>

497
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:39,093
<font color="yellow">If you like the company so much,<br>divorce Jang-go</font>

498
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:42,046
<font color="yellow">and go work at the company all you want.</font>

499
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:45,602
<font color="yellow">That works out. You should do that.</font>

500
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:47,550
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang,</font>

501
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:54,662
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of these, so please<br>let Mi-poong go to work.</font>

502
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:59,269
<font color="yellow">How dare you touch this! Take your hands off!</font>

503
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:05,494
<font color="yellow">- What's all this commotion about?<br>- What's wrong, Geum-sil?</font>

504
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:06,521
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

505
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:09,753
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?<br>- What happened to the fish?</font>

506
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:16,111
<font color="yellow">I told Mi-poong to clean up the fish, and<br>she and her mother are acting so dramatic.</font>

507
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:21,220
<font color="yellow">What on earth did you teach her that<br>makes her talk back to her mother-in-law?</font>

508
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:27,807
<font color="yellow">What could you have taught her while<br>you were dating another woman's husband?</font>

509
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:31,128
<font color="yellow">You're being very offensive.</font>

510
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:36,463
<font color="yellow">How can you say such<br>rude things in front of someone?</font>

511
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:39,746
<font color="yellow">I said rude things? I'm being offensive?</font>

512
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:42,642
<font color="yellow">You're the one being offensive around here.</font>

513
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:48,733
<font color="yellow">I'm so ashamed to have<br>your daughter as my daughter-in-law!</font>

514
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:54,642
<font color="yellow">When I see her face, I think of<br>what you did, and I start to shudder!</font>

515
00:39:56,035 --> 00:40:01,010
<font color="yellow">Yet, I have to put up with her under<br>the same roof! Do you know how I feel?</font>

516
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:07,383
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm so sick<br>and tired of hating you now.</font>

517
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:12,307
<font color="yellow">Please leave Jang-go now!</font>

518
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:15,012
<font color="yellow">- Divorce him!<br>- Geum-sil!</font>

519
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,488
<font color="yellow">That's enough!</font>

520
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:20,490
<font color="yellow">To be frank, it's not like Mi-poong<br>was the one who had an affair!</font>

521
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:26,351
<font color="yellow">What are you doing early in<br>the morning? How embarrassing.</font>

522
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:29,889
<font color="yellow">You're a parent, too,<br>so how can you tell our kids</font>

523
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:32,912
<font color="yellow">to get divorced when they're happy together?</font>

524
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:38,450
<font color="yellow">I'll leave this house instead.<br>Would that make you happy?</font>

525
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,028
<font color="yellow">How would that make me happy?</font>

526
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:43,780
<font color="yellow">If you leave this house,<br>isn't she still your daughter?</font>

527
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:49,983
<font color="yellow">My goodness. It's like you're<br>hiding your head in the sand.</font>

528
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:52,381
<font color="yellow">Then what should I do?</font>

529
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:58,242
<font color="yellow">Would you be happy if<br>I severed ties with my daughter?</font>

530
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,474
<font color="yellow">- Mom.<br>- You stay quiet.</font>

531
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:03,463
<font color="yellow">If that's what you want, I'll do it.</font>

532
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:09,352
<font color="yellow">So please be good to my poor,<br>innocent Mi-poong.</font>

533
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,467
<font color="yellow">Please don't torment her.</font>

534
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,669
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm okay.</font>

535
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:19,720
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the fish,<br>so Mi-poong, hurry up and go to work.</font>

536
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,559
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mi-poong. Go to work.</font>

537
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:35,193
<font color="yellow">I'll move out as soon as possible.</font>

538
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:39,278
<font color="yellow">I'll get out of your way as you wish.</font>

539
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:44,467
<font color="yellow">You could've moved out<br>dozens of times already.</font>

540
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:50,166
<font color="yellow">Please actually leave this time<br>instead of just saying it with your words.</font>

541
00:42:41,905 --> 00:42:44,394
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, Mi-poong is running<br>a little late today, too,</font>

542
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:46,659
<font color="yellow">so how about we start the meeting first?</font>

543
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:48,445
<font color="yellow">She'll come soon.</font>

544
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,691
<font color="yellow">That's right! She's taking the<br>bus today, so there must be a lot of traffic.</font>

545
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:56,115
<font color="yellow">Do other people come early<br>because there's no traffic?</font>

546
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,976
<font color="yellow">Good morning! I'm sorry!<br>I'm a little late today.</font>

547
00:43:05,256 --> 00:43:07,950
<font color="yellow">Since I was late, should I get coffee?</font>

548
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:10,075
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, we need to talk.</font>

549
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:15,653
<font color="yellow">Why did you come so late? Ms. Kim is angry.</font>

550
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:28,102
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I am proud of the<br>fact that you use your lunchtime</font>

551
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:31,240
<font color="yellow">and stay after work to finish your tasks.</font>

552
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:34,231
<font color="yellow">However, if you're always<br>late to work like this,</font>

553
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,793
<font color="yellow">the work atmosphere<br>will get a lot more difficult.</font>

554
00:43:36,818 --> 00:43:38,733
<font color="yellow">I can't just let you get away with this.</font>

555
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,483
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

556
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:43,693
<font color="yellow">If your proposal gets picked,<br>then the products</font>

557
00:43:43,718 --> 00:43:46,041
<font color="yellow">will be made in the factory right away.</font>

558
00:43:46,443 --> 00:43:49,327
<font color="yellow">Then you'll be the sole<br>person-in-charge for all the steps,</font>

559
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:52,236
<font color="yellow">starting from the marketing<br>planning to the launching event.</font>

560
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:57,160
<font color="yellow">What can you do if you can't even<br>come to the team meeting on time?</font>

561
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:03,599
<font color="yellow">I know you're a passionate worker.</font>

562
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:06,349
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because I feel bad for you.</font>

563
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:07,986
<font color="yellow">It makes me upset.</font>

564
00:44:08,325 --> 00:44:10,115
<font color="yellow">So don't be offended.</font>

565
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,490
<font color="yellow">I won't. I'm sorry.</font>

566
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:15,506
<font color="yellow">Try to find a way.</font>

567
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:18,767
<font color="yellow">Isn't your mother-in-law being too much?</font>

568
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:22,974
<font color="yellow">Move out of the house or...</font>

569
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,592
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

570
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
<font color="yellow">Hi, mom.</font>

571
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:42,115
<font color="yellow">Were you late?</font>

572
00:44:42,655 --> 00:44:44,715
<font color="yellow">No, I wasn't late.</font>

573
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,584
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

574
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:50,512
<font color="yellow">I was worried you would be late.</font>

575
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:53,059
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be.</font>

576
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:54,764
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

577
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:59,224
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

578
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,342
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?<br>Why would you be sorry?</font>

579
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:09,648
<font color="yellow">Because of me, your mother-in-law dislikes</font>

580
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:13,959
<font color="yellow">you, and you're leading a hard married life.</font>

581
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:22,474
<font color="yellow">Other married women don't have to even lift<br>a finger at home because they go to work.</font>

582
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:25,905
<font color="yellow">Work life must be hard for you,<br>but on top of that,</font>

583
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,872
<font color="yellow">you're suffering through a hard married life.</font>

584
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:34,802
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset and sorry.</font>

585
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:42,342
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm okay.<br>Work life isn't hard for me at all.</font>

586
00:45:44,294 --> 00:45:48,521
<font color="yellow">I should've moved out from<br>the beginning. I was thoughtless.</font>

587
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:54,131
<font color="yellow">I'm going to look for a room for rent today.</font>

588
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,494
<font color="yellow">So just know that.</font>

589
00:45:57,092 --> 00:45:58,092
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

590
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,537
<font color="yellow">I told you she's very angry!</font>

591
00:46:03,872 --> 00:46:09,452
<font color="yellow">- I'll bring coffee.<br>- No, she said just come right now,
since we're busy.</font>

592
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,256
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up.<br>- Okay.</font>

593
00:46:18,865 --> 00:46:19,865
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

594
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:26,300
<font color="yellow">I have a special order from the chairman.</font>

595
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:31,443
<font color="yellow">Each and every department of Winner's<br>Group must go through an internal audit.</font>

596
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:33,233
<font color="yellow">Get ready.</font>

597
00:46:33,842 --> 00:46:34,842
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

598
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:41,662
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. May I get this?<br>- Go ahead.</font>

599
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:45,691
<font color="yellow">Hello? This is lawyer Lee Jang-go.</font>

600
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,615
<font color="yellow">It'll be taken care of today? Thank you.</font>

601
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:01,669
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

602
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:07,416
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your expression?<br>Did something happen?</font>

603
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:09,896
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

604
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:12,052
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

605
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:14,450
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, so I have to go back to work.</font>

606
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:19,606
<font color="yellow">I got a call that your lease compensation<br>will be given to you today.</font>

607
00:47:20,372 --> 00:47:22,427
<font color="yellow">Really? Are you serious?</font>

608
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,168
<font color="yellow">What? Didn't something happen to you?</font>

609
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:28,912
<font color="yellow">You look so happy now that<br>you're getting money.</font>

610
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,919
<font color="yellow">Who wouldn't be happy to receive<br>money in their bank account?</font>

611
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:34,673
<font color="yellow">It's really being deposited!</font>

612
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:39,523
<font color="yellow">But the amount is pretty small.</font>

613
00:47:40,311 --> 00:47:41,311
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

614
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:45,733
<font color="yellow">I thought you would be able to get at<br>least $30,000, but it'll only be $20,000.</font>

615
00:47:49,662 --> 00:47:53,340
<font color="yellow">$30,000 would've been great,<br>but so is $20,000.</font>

616
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:57,340
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, thank you so much.<br>My mom will be so happy.</font>

617
00:48:01,224 --> 00:48:02,655
<font color="yellow">A deposit of $10,000?</font>

618
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,217
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to get<br>a room here with that kind of money.</font>

619
00:48:08,162 --> 00:48:09,809
<font color="yellow">There is a studio.</font>

620
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:14,608
<font color="yellow">The deposit is $10,000 and the<br>monthly rent is a thousand dollars.</font>

621
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:17,231
<font color="yellow">The monthly rent is a thousand dollars?</font>

622
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,747
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

623
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:33,436
<font color="yellow">The lease compensation came out?</font>

624
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:45,461
<font color="yellow">Will you and Yoo-sung really<br>be okay by yourselves?</font>

625
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:49,727
<font color="yellow">Of course. Don't worry about us anymore.</font>

626
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:53,224
<font color="yellow">If we get a place nearby,<br>we'll be able to see you often.</font>

627
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:55,575
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

628
00:48:57,903 --> 00:49:02,709
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live in that house any longer.</font>

629
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:07,912
<font color="yellow">If I can just get a room that will<br>protect us from the wind and rain,</font>

630
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,186
<font color="yellow">that will make me comfortable.</font>

631
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:18,012
<font color="yellow">Do that then.</font>

632
00:49:19,162 --> 00:49:20,162
<font color="yellow">Move away.</font>

633
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:22,927
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mi-poong.</font>

634
00:49:24,014 --> 00:49:25,997
<font color="yellow">The heavens helped us.</font>

635
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:28,414
<font color="yellow">The lease compensation came out on time.</font>

636
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,162
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

637
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:37,421
<font color="yellow">I was so hopeful while<br>I was coming to see you.</font>

638
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:43,334
<font color="yellow">It's my lunchtime,<br>so let's go find a room together.</font>

639
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:45,677
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

640
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:55,959
<font color="yellow">Right this way.</font>

641
00:49:57,217 --> 00:49:58,217
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

642
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:04,209
<font color="yellow">The house is very sunny, and<br>hot water comes out very well. I like it.</font>

643
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,666
<font color="yellow">To pay a deposit of $30,000<br>and pay a monthly rent</font>

644
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:08,979
<font color="yellow">of only $300 in this neighborhood<br>is very cheap.</font>

645
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,957
<font color="yellow">Can I move in next week?</font>

646
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:15,733
<font color="yellow">Of course! They're moving out tomorrow,<br>so come in whenever you'd like.</font>

647
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:18,497
<font color="yellow">All right. Then I'll sign the contract.</font>

648
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:28,256
<font color="yellow">You're moving out next week? Really?</font>

649
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,535
<font color="yellow">Yes, I just signed the contract.</font>

650
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,568
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I don't know what to say.</font>

651
00:50:37,356 --> 00:50:39,843
<font color="yellow">I was the one who said<br>we should live together.</font>

652
00:50:40,575 --> 00:50:43,383
<font color="yellow">It would have been nice if<br>we could live together happily.</font>

653
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:48,342
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.<br>- Don't be, ma'am.</font>

654
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:52,325
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

655
00:50:52,764 --> 00:50:53,764
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

656
00:50:55,443 --> 00:51:01,271
<font color="yellow">I know it might be strange for me to<br>say this, but I haven't done</font>

657
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:07,318
<font color="yellow">a single shameful thing in my life that<br>would embarrass Mi-poong and Yoo-sung.</font>

658
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:14,349
<font color="yellow">Please be good to Mi-poong.</font>

659
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:19,985
<font color="yellow">And please tell Ms. Hwang<br>to be nicer to her, too.</font>

660
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,372
<font color="yellow">I'm pleading you, ma'am.</font>

661
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,834
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that.</font>

662
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:32,099
<font color="yellow">You should be happy and healthy.</font>

663
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:36,077
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please take care of yourself, too.</font>

664
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,483
<font color="yellow">- I'll be going home now.<br>- All right.</font>

665
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:45,983
<font color="yellow">- Bye.<br>- Bye.</font>

666
00:51:55,077 --> 00:51:58,280
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now that you kicked her out?</font>

667
00:52:02,193 --> 00:52:06,568
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. The only person<br>she can rely on is Mi-poong.</font>

668
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:21,389
<font color="yellow">I was hoping we could go<br>with Kim Mi-poong's proposal.</font>

669
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,483
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

670
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:30,376
<font color="yellow">Premium sportswear isn't bad at all,<br>but she's a newbie without any experience.</font>

671
00:52:31,436 --> 00:52:35,463
<font color="yellow">It's a bit odd if we leave the<br>entire launching process up to a newbie.</font>

672
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:38,041
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo, do you think that way also?</font>

673
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,724
<font color="yellow">I think differently.</font>

674
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:44,287
<font color="yellow">It's true that Mi-poong<br>doesn't have much experience,</font>

675
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:47,928
<font color="yellow">but her ideas are original,<br>and she's very passionate.</font>

676
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:52,467
<font color="yellow">We can have the workers<br>who have experience support her.</font>

677
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:56,671
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's up!</font>

678
00:52:59,537 --> 00:53:02,521
<font color="yellow">- Oh my god!<br>- Mi-poong is amazing!</font>

679
00:53:03,624 --> 00:53:06,624
<font color="yellow">- Does Mi-poong know, too? Young-ju, call her.<br>- Okay.</font>

680
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:09,048
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mi-poong is coming.</font>

681
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:13,650
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, hurry up and come here.<br>Did you get the notice that your proposal passed?</font>

682
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:14,675
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

683
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:17,568
<font color="yellow">Really? I was really chosen?</font>

684
00:53:18,184 --> 00:53:20,438
<font color="yellow">(Successful candidate: Kim Mi-poong)</font>

685
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,990
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, did I really get chosen?</font>

686
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:26,349
<font color="yellow">- Of course! Congratulations!<br>- Congratulations, Mi-poong!</font>

687
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:27,483
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

688
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:29,954
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong really got chosen?</font>

689
00:53:30,561 --> 00:53:33,711
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong! Mi-poong!</font>

690
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,030
<font color="yellow">Congratulations! Kiss!</font>

691
00:53:35,499 --> 00:53:37,566
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's wrong with you?</font>

692
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:42,568
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, you can't do this here. You can<br>get taken away for disorderly conduct.</font>

693
00:53:42,593 --> 00:53:46,818
<font color="yellow">That's right.<br>Don't anger the lonely singles here.</font>

694
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:51,195
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was so happy.<br>Mi-poong, congratulations!</font>

695
00:53:54,637 --> 00:54:02,032
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong's mother was kicked out of Geum-sil's<br>house! She's going to be moving away!</font>

696
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:03,358
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

697
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:04,383
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

698
00:54:05,115 --> 00:54:09,039
<font color="yellow">It would've been better if Mi-poong divorced<br>Jang-go and moved out with her mom.</font>

699
00:54:09,131 --> 00:54:10,465
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, mother.</font>

700
00:54:10,811 --> 00:54:13,793
<font color="yellow">I'm planning something<br>right now, and if that works out,</font>

701
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,128
<font color="yellow">her married life won't be so smooth anymore.</font>

702
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:18,296
<font color="yellow">There better not be any mistakes this time.</font>

703
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:20,137
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

704
00:54:20,162 --> 00:54:23,171
<font color="yellow">- Don't make it like last time where I...<br>- Aunt!</font>

705
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:27,086
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. Hey. Knock, will you?</font>

706
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:29,561
<font color="yellow">- Okay...<br>- Knock, knock!</font>

707
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:35,115
<font color="yellow">- Mother, I'll come down after I change.<br>- All right.</font>

708
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,561
<font color="yellow">When is she leaving?</font>

709
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:50,001
<font color="yellow">Grandma said she'll send me to the orphanage<br>next week. Do I have to go back there?</font>

710
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,119
<font color="yellow">No, Yoo-jin.</font>

711
00:54:55,807 --> 00:55:01,213
<font color="yellow">I'll never send you away,<br>so don't worry, okay?</font>

712
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:15,548
<font color="yellow">- Merry Christmas!<br>- Please help out your poor neighbors.</font>

713
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,079
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

714
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:22,001
<font color="yellow">Hello! Thank you!</font>

715
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:26,744
<font color="yellow">Please help your poor neighbors.</font>

716
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:28,979
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.<br>- You're welcome.</font>

717
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:30,439
<font color="yellow">- Bye.<br>- Bye.</font>

718
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:34,447
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, are you sure we don't have to have</font>

719
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,738
<font color="yellow">a party for you being the final candidate?</font>

720
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,747
<font color="yellow">You can't change your mind later.</font>

721
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:44,392
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm a woman of my word.</font>

722
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,776
<font color="yellow">Instead, I'm on a date with you.</font>

723
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,572
<font color="yellow">That's enough for me.</font>

724
00:55:51,854 --> 00:55:55,454
<font color="yellow">I love it that I don't need<br>to spend any money on you.</font>

725
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,794
<font color="yellow">You're just satisfied going on<br>a walk with me. Yes! I saved money!</font>

726
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:04,251
<font color="yellow">There you go again! You're hitting<br>your amazing husband again!</font>

727
00:56:07,604 --> 00:56:11,184
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

728
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,782
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

729
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:14,416
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

730
00:56:15,314 --> 00:56:18,240
<font color="yellow">The truth is, earlier today,<br>my mom and I went to sign</font>

731
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:20,900
<font color="yellow">a contract for the new house<br>she'll be living in.</font>

732
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:22,682
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

733
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:27,528
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything. Don't lecture me.<br>I know what you're going to say.</font>

734
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:31,008
<font color="yellow">With the $20,000 lease<br>compensation you got today?</font>

735
00:56:31,845 --> 00:56:34,119
<font color="yellow">You can't get a house in<br>Seoul with that kind of money.</font>

736
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:39,773
<font color="yellow">We combined it with the $10,000<br>we had and made a $30,000 deposit.</font>

737
00:56:41,236 --> 00:56:42,236
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

738
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:46,367
<font color="yellow">If your mom really wants<br>to move away, then I'll get more money,</font>

739
00:56:46,392 --> 00:56:48,885
<font color="yellow">so let's get a better house for her.</font>

740
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:51,602
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell you because<br>I knew you would be like this.</font>

741
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,443
<font color="yellow">My mom doesn't want that.</font>

742
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,265
<font color="yellow">- But Mi-poong...<br>- Jang-go.</font>

743
00:56:56,932 --> 00:57:00,546
<font color="yellow">This time, I want to do whatever my mom wants.</font>

744
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,236
<font color="yellow">I want to make her comfortable.<br>Please do this for her.</font>

745
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:09,233
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

746
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:16,273
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make a lot of money<br>and buy a pretty house just for her.</font>

747
00:57:16,992 --> 00:57:21,222
<font color="yellow">A sunny house where she can plant a garden.</font>

748
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:26,334
<font color="yellow">That's my goal and dream from now on.</font>

749
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:30,061
<font color="yellow">Good idea. Le's make sure to do that for her.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Cheer up!<br>- Cheer up!</font>

751
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:40,742
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you really don't need a party?<br>You better not say anything else later on.</font>

752
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:47,617
<font color="yellow">Good!</font>

753
00:58:13,733 --> 00:58:19,175
<font color="yellow">Yes. I can't fail this plan,<br>for the sake of Yoo-jin.</font>

754
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:25,867
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

755
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,008
<font color="yellow">It's tonight.</font>

00:58:33,452 --> 00:58:34,925
<font color="yellow">Take care of it with no mistakes.</font>

757
00:59:16,702 --> 00:59:18,302

760
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,086
<font color="yellow">- Eat a lot.<br>- The spicy rice cakes are delicious.</font>

<font color="yellow">- They're really good.<br>- Very good.</font>

762
00:59:58,423 --> 01:00:02,414
<font color="yellow">But aunt, is it only me and<br>grandma that's moving away?</font>

763
01:00:02,814 --> 01:00:05,617
<font color="yellow">Can't you and Uncle Jang-go come with us?</font>

764
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:08,443
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, do you not<br>want to live with just me?</font>

765
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:12,992
<font color="yellow">I want to live with just you.</font>

766
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:18,195
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant. I'm just said<br>I won't be able to see aunt every day.</font>

767
01:00:18,438 --> 01:00:21,371
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you often. Are you satisfied now?</font>

768
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,276
<font color="yellow">Yes, aunt. You have to visit me often.</font>

769
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,515
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

770
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,039
<font color="yellow">Mom, I have to go to work now.</font>

771
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:38,148
<font color="yellow">I'll go to your new house with Jang-go<br>after work, so let's organize everything then.</font>

772
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,231
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for making you move on your own.</font>

773
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,977
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

774
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,336
<font color="yellow">If you're busy with work,<br>you don't have to come. All right?</font>

775
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:48,361
<font color="yellow">- See you later.<br>- All right.</font>

776

<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

777
01:00:56,751 --> 01:01:00,505
<font color="yellow">What? What did you say?<br>What do you mean by that?</font>

778
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:08,180
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, what do you mean<br>there's a problem with my sportswear?</font>

779
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:10,539
<font color="yellow">Young-ju, show her.</font>

780
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:16,028
<font color="yellow">Isn't this my sportswear that I launched? It's</font>

781
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:19,137
<font color="yellow">It's supposed to come out tomorrow!<br>Where did you get this?</font>

782
01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:22,711
<font color="yellow">It's not yours. It's the sportswear<br>that Good Time released today.</font>

783
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:26,452
<font color="yellow">What? How could they<br>make the same things as us?</font>

784
01:01:27,086 --> 01:01:28,327
<font color="yellow">This doesn't make any sense!</font>

785
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,782
<font color="yellow">Hello. This is Mr. Han of Winner's<br>Group legal investigation team.</font>

787
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:48,854
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll investigate Kim Mi-poong<br>from the third marketing team.</font>

788
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:57,128

<font color="yellow">Where is Kim Mi-poong's desk?</font>

790
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,606

<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

799
01:03:21,104 --> 01:03:23,088
<font color="yellow">She would never do such a thing.</font>

800
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:26,300
<font color="yellow">Make sure she can never hang<br>around the company again.</font>
