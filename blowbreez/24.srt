<font color="yellow">Gosh, that ridiculous scumbag.
So this is how he's paying you back, huh?</font>

00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,012

51
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,948
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're Jang-go's aunt and grandmother.</font>

52
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,879
<font color="yellow">Goodness, just stay down.</font>

53
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:06,207
<font color="yellow">You got hit in the head.
You must be in a lot of pain.</font>

<font color="yellow">Pardon? What...?</font>

55
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,731

56
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:15,637
<font color="yellow">I got hit?</font>

57

<font color="yellow">You don't remember anything?</font>

58
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:23,659
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi and I were so shocked
to find you unconscious</font>

59
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:27,028
<font color="yellow">and bleeding from your head on the streets.</font>

60
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:28,620
<font color="yellow">Did you lose anything?</font>

61
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,528
<font color="yellow">You didn't have anything with you.</font>

62
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,306
<font color="yellow">What? My things?</font>

63
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,291
<font color="yellow">What about my wallet? My wallet wasn't there?</font>

64
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,824
<font color="yellow">Did you have a lot of money in there?</font>

65
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,012
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

66
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,625
<font color="yellow">I had about thirty dollars.</font>

67
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:45,846
<font color="yellow">They made you like this
just for thirty measly dollars?</font>

68
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:50,395
<font color="yellow">Whoever they are, they need
to be locked up behind bars!</font>

69
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:55,301
<font color="yellow">I was on my way home
after getting Yoo-sung's medicine...</font>

70
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,206
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

71
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:00,465
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung is home alone!</font>

72
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:05,255
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- Don't worry. We'll call someone for you.</font>

73
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:06,985
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

74
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,461
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's true.</font>

75
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:14,990
<font color="yellow">When I think about how she hid the fact
she was a defector and seduced my brother,</font>

76
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:19,969
<font color="yellow">flames of anger burn in my chest!</font>

77
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:25,589
<font color="yellow">It seemed like Hee-dong genuinely loves her.</font>

78
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:31,722
<font color="yellow">Those people who live in the back are the
same as her. They all have black hearts!</font>

79
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:39,359
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong seduced Jang-go, too, and
made him fall crazily in love with her!</font>

80
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:41,071
<font color="yellow">Mother is right about everything!</font>

81
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,938
<font color="yellow">Don't be so pessimistic.</font>

82
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,818
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong seemed like a nice person to me.</font>

83
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,941
<font color="yellow">Nice, my foot. How would you know that?</font>

84
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,418
<font color="yellow">There's a saying that goes, "If you want
to know what he's like, look at his friends."</font>

85
00:06:55,868 --> 00:07:00,534
<font color="yellow">Those women in the back are the same
black-hearted women as my sister-in-law!</font>

86
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,135
<font color="yellow">All right. You win.</font>

87
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:03,830
<font color="yellow">You don't understand me.</font>

88
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,528
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's my aunt.</font>

89
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,263
<font color="yellow">Hi, aunt.</font>

90
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:11,755
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

91
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,895
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

92
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:19,043
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

93
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,661
<font color="yellow">Aunt!</font>

94
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,083
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

95
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:27,888
<font color="yellow">Don't cry!</font>

96
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:32,296
<font color="yellow">You're Yoo-sung, right?</font>

97
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:35,598
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Kim Yoo-sung.</font>

98
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,926
<font color="yellow">I live in the owner's house.
You've seen me before, haven't you?</font>

99
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:45,329
<font color="yellow">Your grandma just called me.
She said something came up,</font>

100
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:48,513
<font color="yellow">so she wanted you to
play with me at my house.</font>

101
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:49,731
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

102
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:52,317
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

103
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:53,342
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

104
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:56,989
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung.</font>

105
00:07:57,466 --> 00:08:00,680
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, take him inside our bedroom.
I'll bring some snacks.</font>

106
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:03,441
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Let's go inside.
- Go inside.</font>

107
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:07,559
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what are you doing? Why are
you bringing that kid here at this hour?</font>

108
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,918
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo was attacked by a stranger.
She's in the hospital right now.</font>

109
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,813
<font color="yellow">So how could I not watch over him?</font>

110
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:14,653
<font color="yellow">What? Attacked?</font>

111
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,676
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Who did that?</font>

112
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:18,590
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

113
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,875
<font color="yellow">Aunt Nam-yi and grandma were
coming home when they found Ms. Joo</font>

114
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,661
<font color="yellow">unconscious on the streets
and took her to the hospital.</font>

115
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,317
<font color="yellow">Your aunt and grandma?</font>

116
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:30,765
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Aunt called me to tell me to watch
over the kid since there's nobody home.</font>

117
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,856
<font color="yellow">So please understand, okay?</font>

118
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:39,506
<font color="yellow">Goodness! What kind of terrible
person would do such a thing?</font>

119
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:42,338
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

120
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:47,338
<font color="yellow">Jang-go didn't follow Mi-poong
all the way over there, did he?</font>

121
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,573
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

122
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:03,408
<font color="yellow">Mom, what happened?</font>

123
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:06,463
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

124
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:08,612
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

125
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,588
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm fine.</font>

126
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,940
<font color="yellow">Jang-go's aunt and grandmother saved me.</font>

127
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:23,150
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

128
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:29,744
<font color="yellow">Besides getting five stitches on the head,
your mom is fine, so don't worry too much.</font>

129
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,510
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that you didn't
suffer worse injuries.</font>

130
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:40,057
<font color="yellow">I was so shocked that my heart
is still beating fast right now.</font>

131
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:42,369
<font color="yellow">Aunt, what happened?</font>

132
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:45,323
<font color="yellow">I think she was attacked by a stranger.</font>

133
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,951
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that we happened
to be passing by at that time.</font>

134
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:52,330
<font color="yellow">If she remained there, it wouldn't
have ended with just five stitches.</font>

135
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,315
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

136
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:02,705
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You don't have to thank us.
We only did what was natural as your neighbors.</font>

137
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,079
<font color="yellow">What's up with you, Jang-go?</font>

138
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:06,744
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

139
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,588
<font color="yellow">Someone could misunderstand you
as this family's son-in-law.</font>

140
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:12,384
<font color="yellow">You could have just passed
on the news to Mi-poong.</font>

141
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,870
<font color="yellow">What did you come here for?
What if your mom found out?</font>

142
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:15,895
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

143
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:20,229
<font color="yellow">What? Did I make something up?</font>

144
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,492
<font color="yellow">Anyways, since your daughter
is here, we'll be going now.</font>

145
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,229
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

146
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,849
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung is playing with Jang-soo right now,</font>

147
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:34,282
<font color="yellow">and he'll be sleeping
with me tonight, so don't worry</font>

148
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,949
<font color="yellow">about a thing and just focus on getting better.</font>

149
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:41,362
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much. I don't know
how I'll be able to pay you back.</font>

150
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:44,276
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,416
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going with us?</font>

152
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,540
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave a little bit later.</font>

153
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,744
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about him! Let's go!</font>

154
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,987
<font color="yellow">Mom, what happened?</font>

155
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:04,752
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

156
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:09,237
<font color="yellow">while I was coming back
from buying Yoo-sung's medicine,</font>

157
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:12,690
<font color="yellow">I knocked out, and when
I woke up again, I was in the hospital.</font>

158
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:16,346
<font color="yellow">I don't remember what happened.</font>

159
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,510
<font color="yellow">Did you lose anything precious?</font>

160
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,229
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything precious.</font>

161
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:28,924
<font color="yellow">I just lost my wallet
that had thirty dollars inside.</font>

162
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:34,268
<font color="yellow">What about your ring?
Did you leave that at home?</font>

163
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:42,658
<font color="yellow">My ring? Where did my ring go?</font>

164
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:46,945
<font color="yellow">They must have taken my ring! What do I do?</font>

165
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,065
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what do I do about my ring?</font>

166
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
<font color="yellow">Ring?</font>

167
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:51,853
<font color="yellow">What kind of ring?</font>

168
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,021
<font color="yellow">It's a silver ring.
My husband gave it to me</font>

169
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:57,853
<font color="yellow">before I came down to South Korea.
It's very precious to me.</font>

170
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:01,182
<font color="yellow">It's not expensive, but I must find that ring!</font>

171
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,776
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Ms. Joo.</font>

172
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,178
<font color="yellow">Where exactly did the accident happen?</font>

173
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:48,448
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Hold on.</font>

174
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:51,714
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

175
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,690
<font color="yellow">What are you doing over there?</font>

176
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:58,479
<font color="yellow">I lost my earring, so I was looking for it.</font>

177
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:01,463
<font color="yellow">Go home quickly. It's dangerous here.</font>

178
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:04,815
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something happen her?</font>

179
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:08,167
<font color="yellow">A lady was attacked by a stranger here.</font>

180
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,557
<font color="yellow">So don't wander around by
yourself at night and be careful.</font>

181
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,221
<font color="yellow">Oh, all right.</font>

182
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,151
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

183
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,674
<font color="yellow">I think we can check the CCTV over there.</font>

184
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,093
<font color="yellow">Can we check it?</font>

185
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:32,596
<font color="yellow">You couldn't ask for worse timing.</font>

186
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:35,213
<font color="yellow">It broke a few days ago.
It is being requested to be fixed.</font>

187
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:40,502
<font color="yellow">Then can we check the CCTV that starts
recording from the pharmacy over there?</font>

188
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,423
<font color="yellow">I think we'll be able to
find out something from that.</font>

189
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,916
<font color="yellow">I think it's this punk.</font>

190
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,908
<font color="yellow">The body figure looks like it belongs
to a woman rather than a man.</font>

191
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,159
<font color="yellow">A woman?</font>

192
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:05,112
<font color="yellow">No way. It looks like a skinny high school boy.</font>

193
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:08,124
<font color="yellow">Women can't do such daring things.</font>

194
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:09,901
<font color="yellow">Can you zoom in?</font>

195
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,804
<font color="yellow">It was captured from too far away.
I can't zoom in any further.</font>

196
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:18,940
<font color="yellow">And I think he thought the ring was a
good ring and took it so he could sell it.</font>

197
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:21,389
<font color="yellow">If he found out it was a silver ring,
he would have tossed it away.</font>

198
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,712
<font color="yellow">Then it would be impossible to find it.</font>

199
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,510
<font color="yellow">(Little Tadpole)</font>

200
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:31,753
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mi-poong.</font>

201
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:40,802
<font color="yellow">How can it be raining? The ring couldn't
have been washed away by the rain, could it?</font>

202
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,284
<font color="yellow">Is it here?</font>

203
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:49,981
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's around here.</font>

204
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,384
<font color="yellow">Your mother was found unconscious here.</font>

205
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

206
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:08,100
<font color="yellow">I have to find that ring.
It means a lot to my mom.</font>

207
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:11,808
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, it won't be here.</font>

208
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,578
<font color="yellow">He would've found out it wasn't
a gold ring and just thrown it away.</font>

209
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,627
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

210
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,916
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine. Don't worry.</font>

211
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,601
<font color="yellow">Why are they just standing
there and not leaving?</font>

212
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:34,252
<font color="yellow">That ring can't be washed away...</font>

213
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:44,080
<font color="yellow">Please stop raining. Stop raining.</font>

214
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,221
<font color="yellow">Mom, please stop the rain!</font>

215
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:51,026
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

216
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
<font color="yellow">He's adorable.</font>

217
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:02,862
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

218
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:07,276
<font color="yellow">Kids are the cutest when they're sleeping.</font>

219
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,181
<font color="yellow">You two should have a baby, too. Whether
it's a son or daughter, it'll be adorable.</font>

220
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,713
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, let's try harder!</font>

221
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,354
<font color="yellow">Try harder?</font>

222
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:22,656
<font color="yellow">You two don't know what shame is.</font>

223
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:31,666
<font color="yellow">Mom, forget about that ring now.</font>

224
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,682
<font color="yellow">If you keep thinking about it,
you'll just be upset.</font>

225
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,045
<font color="yellow">How can I forget that ring?</font>

226
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:43,096
<font color="yellow">It's the last keepsake your father left me.</font>

227
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,992
<font color="yellow">Whoever did this will be punished.</font>

228
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:52,255
<font color="yellow">If he needed money, he should have worked
for it. How can he do this to someone?</font>

229
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,711
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong, don't you think this is strange?</font>

230
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:00,251
<font color="yellow">It's not an expensive gold ring.</font>

231
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:02,191
<font color="yellow">It's a cheap silver ring.</font>

232
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:07,235
<font color="yellow">Since it's night, he thought it was a
gold ring and took it so that he can sell it.</font>

233
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:12,758
<font color="yellow">When I had that ring on,</font>

234
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,180
<font color="yellow">I felt sturdy.</font>

235
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,946
<font color="yellow">Now that I lost it,</font>

236
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,243
<font color="yellow">I feel so empty.</font>

237
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:28,540
<font color="yellow">I feel like I lost all hope.</font>

238
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,567
<font color="yellow">Why would you lose all hope?</font>

239
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:33,227
<font color="yellow">You have Yoo-sung and me.</font>

240
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,954
<font color="yellow">We're your hope.</font>

241
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:42,993
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

242
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:47,515
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

243
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,235
<font color="yellow">I'm just glad you weren't severely injured.</font>

244
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,754
<font color="yellow">Let's forget about it. From now on,
only good things will happen.</font>

245
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

246
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,922
<font color="yellow">Oh, my baby.</font>

247
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,704
<font color="yellow">It's still there.</font>

248
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,266
<font color="yellow">It's over. It's over now.</font>

249
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,723
<font color="yellow">Lie down in the room. I'll set the blankets.</font>

250
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:41,314
<font color="yellow">Goodness, no. I lied down all this time
in the hospital. My head hurts now.</font>

251
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,953
<font color="yellow">Will you really be all right?</font>

252
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,141
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm all right.</font>

253
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,047
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, go bring Yoo-sung.
He needs to go to kindergarten.</font>

254
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,802
<font color="yellow">No, no. I'll go. If you go and meet Ms. Hwang,</font>

255
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,900
<font color="yellow">she won't have any nice words to say to you.</font>

256
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,615
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-sung.
- Grandma.</font>

257
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:02,931
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
- Hello!</font>

258
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,289
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>

259
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:08,126
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I feel a lot better.</font>

260
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,314
<font color="yellow">You had a hard time sleeping
with Yoo-sung, didn't you?</font>

261
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:15,845
<font color="yellow">Goodness, no. We slept well and woke up well.</font>

262
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:19,793
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for troubling you, ma'am.</font>

263
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,195
<font color="yellow">It's no trouble at all.</font>

264
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,747
<font color="yellow">Don't say such a thing.</font>

265
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:28,984
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to take Yoo-sung to the bus.
- Okay.</font>

266
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,735
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, say bye to grandma.</font>

267
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,540
<font color="yellow">Bye, grandma.</font>

268
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:36,137
<font color="yellow">- How cute.
- Say good-bye to her, too.</font>

269
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:38,540
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

270
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:41,024
<font color="yellow">He's adorable.</font>

271
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:47,402
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am, it's shabby, but please sit down.
I'll make you a warm cup of tea.
- Oh, no.</font>

272
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:51,540
<font color="yellow">I don't need tea. I just...</font>

273
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,446
<font color="yellow">Speak comfortably, ma'am.</font>

274
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,198
<font color="yellow">I would like to apologize on behalf</font>

275
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:01,117
<font color="yellow">of my daughter-in-law who wrecked
your home last time.</font>

276
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:06,657
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil isn't such a spiteful person.</font>

277
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:10,634
<font color="yellow">She's just worried since
this concerns her son's future.</font>

278
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:14,460
<font color="yellow">She did something she shouldn't have.</font>

279
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,172
<font color="yellow">Young-ae, I'm sorry.</font>

280
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:26,181
<font color="yellow">It might be difficult, but I hope you can
understand her from a mother's perspective.</font>

281
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:30,243
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that, ma'am.</font>

282
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:33,605
<font color="yellow">I heard you were going to move out soon.</font>

283
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:38,899
<font color="yellow">Forget about all the awful things that
happened here and live a happy life.</font>

284
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,712
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

285
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:45,781
<font color="yellow">I made pine nut porridge.
I don't know if you'll like it though.</font>

286
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:51,778
<font color="yellow">- Try it.
- Thank you so much. I'll enjoy it.</font>

287
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:57,493
<font color="yellow">What? You're coming back
because father is sick?</font>

288
00:21:58,462 --> 00:21:59,462
<font color="yellow">Tonight?</font>

289
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,211
<font color="yellow">They're coming today?</font>

290
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:05,961
<font color="yellow">Oh, all right.</font>

291
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:09,001
<font color="yellow">I'll call Dr. Yang.</font>

292
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:10,899
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

293
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:14,073
<font color="yellow">Is Mr. Kim coming back already?</font>

294
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:19,836
<font color="yellow">It's not easy finding his granddaughter
over there. He's so distressed that he's sick.</font>

295
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:26,422
<font color="yellow">I guess buying those charms and
bowing before Buddha worked after all!</font>

296
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:30,493
<font color="yellow">Of course! We bowed until our knees
fell out, so they must work!</font>

297
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:33,336
<font color="yellow">You better act like you don't know me later on.</font>

298
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:36,164
<font color="yellow">Of course I won't.</font>

299
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,805
<font color="yellow">I do feel bad for Mr. Kim though.</font>

300
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:42,060
<font color="yellow">He should just take you guys
in as his children since</font>

301
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,931
<font color="yellow">you served him all this time.
Don't you think so?</font>

302
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:46,620
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying!</font>

303
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:49,614
<font color="yellow">I can just be a hundred times nicer to him than</font>

304
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,876
<font color="yellow">his biological granddaughter will ever be!</font>

305
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:59,451
<font color="yellow">Anyways, is Shin-ae really gone?
There's no news from her ever since then?</font>

306
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:04,868
<font color="yellow">She's probably contacting Hee-dong right
now so that she can come home with him.</font>

307
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,220
<font color="yellow">Are you going to accept her again
as if nothing happened?</font>

308
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,473
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Of course not!</font>

309
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:16,559
<font color="yellow">If she acts without a conscience
again and tries to come home with</font>

310
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:21,189
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, I'll reveal all her lies
and officially kick her out of here!</font>

311
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,602
<font color="yellow">What if Hee-dong forgives her and accepts her?</font>

312
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:27,931
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going to kick both of them out!</font>

313
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:32,011
<font color="yellow">Father and Dal-ho won't
forgive her this time either!</font>

314
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:35,564
<font color="yellow">Only father and grandfather
are coming back today?</font>

315
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,829
<font color="yellow">Didn't my mom tell you?</font>

316
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,161
<font color="yellow">My father told her earlier.</font>

317
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:46,110
<font color="yellow">I'm at the market right now.</font>

318
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,367
<font color="yellow">But grandfather must not
have found his granddaughter.</font>

319
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:56,045
<font color="yellow">Yeah, he didn't find her yet.
It'll take some time to find her.</font>

320
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:57,978
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

321
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:03,352
<font color="yellow">He can't find his granddaughter
over there when she's here in Korea.</font>

322
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:07,557
<font color="yellow">But what do we do? I miss you so much, but I</font>

323
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:11,048
<font color="yellow">think I'll have to stay here
for the time being.</font>

324
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:14,313
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

325
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:18,181
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

326
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:21,022
<font color="yellow">Something to tell me? What is it?</font>

327
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:23,564
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

328
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:27,638
<font color="yellow">Since you're away doing something important,
I'll tell you when you come back.</font>

329
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,141
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, is something wrong?</font>

330
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,092
<font color="yellow">Tell me if there is.</font>

331
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:34,695
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.</font>

332
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,998
<font color="yellow">You're doing something important
over there, so focus on that.</font>

333
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,558
<font color="yellow">So grandfather is coming today, right?</font>

334
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,431
<font color="yellow">Why is my heart racing so fast?</font>

335
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,227
<font color="yellow">My fate can change tonight.</font>

336
00:25:04,994 --> 00:25:05,994
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

337
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,485
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens, I will change my fate.</font>

338
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:14,954
<font color="yellow">I will become his granddaughter
and the heiress of Winner's Group.</font>

339
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:25,923
<font color="yellow">But what happened to Ms. Joo?</font>

340
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:29,868
<font color="yellow">She won't be suspecting me, will she?</font>

341
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:35,462
<font color="yellow">What if the police is looking for me?</font>

342
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:03,985
<font color="yellow">Why is it so quiet?</font>

343
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:08,220
<font color="yellow">Did Ms. Joo die?</font>

344
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:12,712
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

345
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,938
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shocked?</font>

346
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:22,032
<font color="yellow">You came out so suddenly.</font>

347
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,220
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here again?</font>

348
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:33,626
<font color="yellow">What? You went back to your in-laws?</font>

349
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,493
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think my mother-in-law
calmed down a bit.</font>

350
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:42,329
<font color="yellow">That's why I came to thank you.</font>

351
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:45,243
<font color="yellow">I bought beef, too.</font>

352
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,485
<font color="yellow">Make some seaweed soup with it.</font>

353
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:51,556
<font color="yellow">Thank you for worrying about me.</font>

354
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:54,524
<font color="yellow">You chose good apples. Have some.</font>

355
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:56,853
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

356
00:26:58,072 --> 00:26:59,072
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

357
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:05,352
<font color="yellow">But what's wrong with your face? Are you sick?</font>

358
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:06,892
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

359
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,212
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was mugged on the streets.</font>

360
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,564
<font color="yellow">Mugged?</font>

361
00:27:14,392 --> 00:27:15,573
<font color="yellow">Who did that?</font>

362
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:22,571
<font color="yellow">If I knew, I would feel a lot better.
He hit me from behind, so I feel so upset.</font>

363
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,712
<font color="yellow">Didn't you report it to the police?</font>

364
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:31,036
<font color="yellow">There are CCTVs everywhere nowadays.
You might be able to catch him in no time.</font>

365
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:36,756
<font color="yellow">But the CCTV in the park happened to be broken.</font>

366
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,774
<font color="yellow">The CCTV was broken?</font>

367
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:46,360
<font color="yellow">I didn't lose much, so the
police just wants to let it go.</font>

368
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,540
<font color="yellow">But I must find that ring.</font>

369
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:54,798
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why they
stole such a cheap silver ring.</font>

370
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:57,353
<font color="yellow">Ring?</font>

371
00:27:58,142 --> 00:27:59,142
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

372
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:03,704
<font color="yellow">It was a ring my mother-in-law used to wear.</font>

373
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:09,774
<font color="yellow">It was the last thing my husband
gave to me before he died.</font>

374
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:17,431
<font color="yellow">It's a relief you weren't seriously injured.</font>

375
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,440
<font color="yellow">Just forget about it.</font>

376
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,329
<font color="yellow">Yes, I should.</font>

377
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:27,634
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong told me to forget about it, too.</font>

378
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:31,493
<font color="yellow">This neighborhood won't do. It's too dangerous.</font>

379
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:36,406
<font color="yellow">Something terrible happened to you.
You should move away from here.</font>

380
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:40,306
<font color="yellow">We already decided to move.</font>

381
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,681
<font color="yellow">We already signed the contract.</font>

382
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:44,673
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

383
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,195
<font color="yellow">You made a good decision.</font>

384
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:53,289
<font color="yellow">The CCTV broke and they're going
to move away from here, too.</font>

385
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:56,188
<font color="yellow">My mom is helping me from heaven.</font>

386
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:20,212
<font color="yellow">Sung-sik, we need to talk.</font>

387
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:27,876
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and say what you have to say.</font>

388
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,946
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to talk outside
when the weather is so cold?</font>

389
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
<font color="yellow">Sung-sik,</font>

390
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,196
<font color="yellow">I don't want to fight with you anymore.</font>

391
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,619
<font color="yellow">Let's stop.</font>

392
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:46,787
<font color="yellow">Is that why you wanted to see me?</font>

393
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,638
<font color="yellow">I think you're done talking then.</font>

394
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:53,081
<font color="yellow">- I'll be leaving first.
- Wait a minute.</font>

395
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,750
<font color="yellow">Then let me ask you something.</font>

396
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,790
<font color="yellow">Why are you bothering Mi-poong so much?</font>

397
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:04,751
<font color="yellow">I'm not bothering her. I like her.</font>

398
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,079
<font color="yellow">You like her?</font>

399
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

400
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:10,936
<font color="yellow">I like her. I sincerely like her.</font>

401
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:12,415
<font color="yellow">Sincerely?</font>

402
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:15,689
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

403
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,935
<font color="yellow">If you sincerely like her, how can you
talk about "sticking a flag" in her?</font>

404
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:23,962
<font color="yellow">Fine. At first, I said I was going
to stick a flag into her.</font>

405
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:27,604
<font color="yellow">But I said that when
I didn't know her very well.</font>

406
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:32,860
<font color="yellow">To be honest, the strong resentment
I had against you influenced me.</font>

407
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:36,408
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Strong resentment against me?</font>

408
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:41,871
<font color="yellow">It's true. We're friends, but you punched
because of one woman?</font>

409
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,618
<font color="yellow">If you were me, would you
be able to forgive you?</font>

410
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,048
<font color="yellow">So that was what it was about?</font>

411
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,056
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's do this.</font>

412
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:58,087
<font color="yellow">Punch me once and let's end this.</font>

413
00:30:58,915 --> 00:31:00,641
<font color="yellow">Leave innocent Mi-poong alone.</font>

414
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:06,813
<font color="yellow">Sung-sik, Mi-poong and
I genuinely like each other.</font>

415
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:12,218
<font color="yellow">So hit me once and give up on her.</font>

416
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,521
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

417
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,100
<font color="yellow">Don't regret this.</font>

418
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:22,142
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

419
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:24,454
<font color="yellow">Bite down.</font>

420
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,397
<font color="yellow">Forget it, you jerk.</font>

421
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:56,061
<font color="yellow">I'll be leaving first.</font>

422
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:04,235
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, I dare you
to mistreat my nice Mi-poong.</font>

423
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,144
<font color="yellow">I'll definitely take her heart then.</font>

424
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:09,962
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

425
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,329
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

426
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,098
<font color="yellow">This is to let you know that...</font>

427
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:44,318
<font color="yellow">you have been transferred from the secretary's</font>

428
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:46,235
<font color="yellow">office to the third marketing team today.</font>

429
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:48,727
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

430
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,102
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going back to
the third marketing team?</font>

431
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:12,993
<font color="yellow">Mr. Bang...</font>

432
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,981
<font color="yellow">the personnel division contacted me that I'm</font>

433
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:23,705
<font color="yellow">being transferred to the third marketing team.</font>

434
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,519
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

435
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:31,588
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to see you. That's great.</font>

436
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:37,065
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, Mr. Bang.</font>

437
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,167
<font color="yellow">- I wanted to say...
- Thank you for everything.</font>

438
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,958
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say
such heartless words to me.</font>

439
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,261
<font color="yellow">Just pack your things and go.</font>

440
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:20,115
<font color="yellow">- Welcome back!
- Congratulations for coming back!</font>

441
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:22,918
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you're not going
back to the secretary office again?</font>

442
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:25,334
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll never leave the marketing team again.</font>

443
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,107
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, don't we need to have
a party for Mi-poong's return?</font>

444
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,474
<font color="yellow">Then let's have a party this Friday.</font>

445
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,263
<font color="yellow">It's on me, so all of you have
to be there or be square!</font>

446
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:39,224
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim!
- That's enough! Let's get to work.</font>

447
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:49,122
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, congratulations for
going back to the marketing team.</font>

448
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,140
<font color="yellow">Don't make any plans tonight.</font>

449
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:59,992
<font color="yellow">It's my mother's birthday today.
Let's go and officially greet her.</font>

450
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:11,052
<font color="yellow">This won't do. Let's go back to the mall.</font>

451
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,818
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

452
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:15,922
<font color="yellow">I don't think giving her a scarf
for her birthday is enough.</font>

453
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,455
<font color="yellow">Let's buy her facial cream, too.</font>

454
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:23,183
<font color="yellow">It's fine. It's the thought that counts.
It took us a long time to pick this one.</font>

455
00:35:23,826 --> 00:35:25,159
<font color="yellow">My mom will like it.</font>

456
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:29,315
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure?
- Of course. It's fine.</font>

457
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:32,943
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

458
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:35,591
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think about it,</font>

459
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:41,671
<font color="yellow">I think you should just give her the gift today,
and we should go greet her together next time.</font>

460
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:42,893
<font color="yellow">Next time? When?</font>

461
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:49,671
<font color="yellow">Today, I'm going to officially tell
my entire family that we're dating.</font>

462
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:51,690
<font color="yellow">That you're my girlfriend.</font>

463
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:56,044
<font color="yellow">To treat you nicely
because you're the woman I love.</font>

464
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:59,374
<font color="yellow">Just stay by my side.</font>

465
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,146
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

466
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,170
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

467
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,148
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, what are we doing here?</font>

468
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:12,115
<font color="yellow">I was thinking we should give mother
a washing machine for her birthday.</font>

469
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,866
<font color="yellow">I didn't even bring any wedding gifts.
A washing machine would</font>

470
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:17,529
<font color="yellow">be a nice birthday gift.
Besides, the one we have is too old.</font>

471
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,747
<font color="yellow">A washing machine?</font>

472
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,568
<font color="yellow">Why? Don't you have money?</font>

473
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,763
<font color="yellow">If you don't have cash, you can pay with card!</font>

474
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:25,389
<font color="yellow">- Well, I guess so.
- Look! Come here!</font>

475
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:26,414
<font color="yellow">Wait up.</font>

476
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:31,857
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what about this one?</font>

477
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:35,716
<font color="yellow">It looks so stylish and nice!</font>

478
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,099
<font color="yellow">I like it, too. It's nice!</font>

479
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,980
<font color="yellow">Right? Shall we test it out?</font>

480
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:43,261
<font color="yellow">- It works?
- Of course.</font>

481
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:48,537
<font color="yellow">Squeeze. Squeeze.</font>

482
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:04,177
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's going around and
around and around! Awesome!</font>

483
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:08,007
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, our backs and
knees won't hurt anymore!</font>

484
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:11,088
<font color="yellow">Mother will love this! Let's get this one!
What do you think?</font>

485
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,638
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's get this one.</font>

486
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:18,443
<font color="yellow">It's going around and around and around!</font>

487
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:20,955
<font color="yellow">That's right. It should work like this.</font>

488
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:29,881
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

489
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:33,646
<font color="yellow">Please spread news about us!
Thank you! Good-bye!</font>

490
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:40,527
<font color="yellow">You had so many customers
that you couldn't even eat until now.</font>

491
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,810
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat.</font>

492
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:45,576
<font color="yellow">I get full just thinking
about raising the sales.</font>

493
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:49,383
<font color="yellow">Goodness. People will think this is your store.</font>

494
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:52,050
<font color="yellow">Your boss's wife won't even be
able to work as hard as you do.</font>

495
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:55,356
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't your boss give you a raise?</font>

496
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:58,641
<font color="yellow">He said he would give me
a bonus if the sales increase.</font>

497
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,246
<font color="yellow">But what should we buy for Geum-sil?</font>

498
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:05,463
<font color="yellow">I was thinking of buying her cosmetics.
What about you?</font>

499
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,994
<font color="yellow">I already bought it on the way here.</font>

500
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,720
<font color="yellow">You bought long underwear again, didn't you?</font>

501
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:11,745
<font color="yellow">How'd you know?</font>

502
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,197
<font color="yellow">You bought it for the past two years.
You always buy long underwear!</font>

503
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:18,666
<font color="yellow">Long underwear is the best during winter!</font>

504
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:20,456
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

505
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:24,501
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello! You're just on time!
We were eating kimbap.</font>

506
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:25,947
<font color="yellow">Come and sit down.</font>

507
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:29,977
<font color="yellow">- I feel so bad for troubling you all the time.
- Goodness, it's no trouble at all!</font>

508
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,936
<font color="yellow">- Won-bin, come and eat with us.
- Okay!</font>

509
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

510
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,150
<font color="yellow">is Geum-sil not here today?</font>

511
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:53,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's her birthday today, so she went
to eat lunch with her friends.</font>

512
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:56,312
<font color="yellow">- It's her birthday today?
- Yes.</font>

513
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,385
<font color="yellow">If you had told me beforehand,
I would have prepared a gift!</font>

514
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,994
<font color="yellow">What? Why would he buy her a birthday gift?</font>

515
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,955
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Won-bin, you eat very deliciously!</font>

516
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:11,119
<font color="yellow">Does this kimbap suit your taste?</font>

517
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:12,924
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's very delicious!</font>

518
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:15,569
<font color="yellow">It tastes like the kimbap
my mom used to make for me!</font>

519
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:17,470
<font color="yellow">Kimbap your mom used to make for you?</font>

520
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,274
<font color="yellow">Doesn’t she make it for you anymore?</font>

521
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:22,111
<font color="yellow">No. She can't.</font>

522
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,413
<font color="yellow">She passed away.</font>

523
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:07,393
<font color="yellow">Who can it be?</font>

524
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:09,560
<font color="yellow">Is Dr. Yang already here?</font>

525
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:10,862
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

526
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:29,861
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? Why did you come back?</font>

527
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:31,854
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

528
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:33,916
<font color="yellow">What? Mother?</font>

529
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:35,822
<font color="yellow">Who is your mother?</font>

530
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:39,369
<font color="yellow">Get out of this house this instant!</font>

531
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:42,783
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about what happened last time.</font>

532
00:40:43,518 --> 00:40:46,674
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me, grandmother and mother.</font>

533
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:49,244
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do now?</font>

534
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,916
<font color="yellow">You threw a tantrum before you left! How dare</font>

535
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:54,159
<font color="yellow">you come here now and try to sweet talk us?</font>

536
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:56,878
<font color="yellow">I was having such a hard time, so I talked</font>

537
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:59,463
<font color="yellow">back to you then, but I'll never do it again!</font>

538
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,963
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me this once, mother!</font>

539
00:41:01,988 --> 00:41:04,752
<font color="yellow">You unlucky brat! Why are you
trying to stick around here again?</font>

540
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:09,336
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out of this house at once!</font>

541
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,361
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

542
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,861
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear her tell you to leave?</font>

543
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,929
<font color="yellow">Get out at once!</font>

544
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:18,510
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see an unlucky brat
like you for another second!</font>

545
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:22,197
<font color="yellow">- So get out!
- Get out!</font>

546
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:23,823
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

547
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,361
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

548
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:30,526
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing right now?</font>

549
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:35,304
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

550
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,002
<font color="yellow">Honey. Father.</font>

551
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:47,697
<font color="yellow">Grandfather! Father! I have committed
a grave sin! Please forgive me just this once!</font>

552
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:51,131
<font color="yellow">What is she talking about?</font>

553
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:54,854
<font color="yellow">What did she do wrong this time?</font>

554
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:58,018
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

555
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:03,494
<font color="yellow">she's a North Korean defector.</font>

556
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:08,822
<font color="yellow">She deceived all of us and married Hee-dong!</font>

557
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:11,089
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

558
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:13,424
<font color="yellow">A defector?</font>

559
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,901
<font color="yellow">She fooled us all, Mr. Kim!</font>

560
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:18,408
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, she played with us!</font>

561
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:22,701
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, is that true?</font>

562
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,260
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's true.</font>

563
00:42:27,682 --> 00:42:29,582
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, father.</font>

564
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:34,791
<font color="yellow">She lied to us about her name, age,
and hometown! They're all lies!</font>

565
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:37,472
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to us?</font>

566
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,447
<font color="yellow">We treated you so nicely!</font>

567
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:48,190
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, father! Please forgive me, father!</font>

568
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:06,565
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, please forgive me this one time!</font>

569
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:18,549
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

570
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,391
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, get up for a moment.</font>

571
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,127
<font color="yellow">Grandfather...</font>

572
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:35,604
<font color="yellow">Get up. Let me see your hand.</font>

573
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:40,612
<font color="yellow">This ring...</font>

574
00:43:41,597 --> 00:43:42,597
<font color="yellow">This ring...</font>

575
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:55,057
<font color="yellow">Grandfather...</font>

576
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,096
<font color="yellow">It's the same!</font>

577
00:44:02,424 --> 00:44:03,758
<font color="yellow">Elder, what's wrong?</font>

578
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,143
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

579
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,370
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae...</font>

580
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:12,093
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this ring?</font>

581
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:16,651
<font color="yellow">This is my ring.</font>

582
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:20,901
<font color="yellow">It's my ring that my grandmother
passed onto me.</font>

583
00:44:22,182 --> 00:44:28,158
<font color="yellow">This was your grandmother's ring?</font>

584
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

585
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:36,901
<font color="yellow">Then what's your grandmother's name?</font>

586
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:40,803
<font color="yellow">My grandmother's name is...</font>

587
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,447
<font color="yellow">Kim Soon-ok.</font>

588
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,484
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

589
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,760
<font color="yellow">Kim Soon-ok?</font>

590
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:53,526
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

591
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:01,916
<font color="yellow">Then what is your father's name?</font>

592
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,174
<font color="yellow">My father's name is Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

593
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:12,463
<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon?</font>

594
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:18,244
<font color="yellow">Are you sure his name is Kim Dae-hoon?</font>

595
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:20,206
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

596
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:22,135
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, you...</font>

597
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:28,861
<font color="yellow">Then what's your name?</font>

598
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,166
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Shin-ae.</font>

599
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:36,127
<font color="yellow">Is that your real name?</font>

600
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:38,940
<font color="yellow">You said you lied about your name, too.</font>

601
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:40,852
<font color="yellow">What's your real name?</font>

602
00:45:41,831 --> 00:45:44,440
<font color="yellow">What's your real name that
you used in North Korea?</font>

603
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,362
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee.</font>

604
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,682
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee.</font>

605
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,299
<font color="yellow">What? Kim Seung-hee?</font>

606
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,076
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee. Kim Seung-hee.</font>

607
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:03,010
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee.</font>

608
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,705
<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

609
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,369
<font color="yellow">Kim Soon-ok.</font>

610
00:46:11,947 --> 00:46:14,760
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on, Dal-ho?</font>

611
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:17,063
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather!
- Father!</font>

612
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:20,188
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather!
- Elder!</font>

613
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:22,196
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no!
- What do we do?</font>

614
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:24,884
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, what do we do?</font>

615
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:34,079
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

616
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:37,643
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

617
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:41,770
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is right.</font>

618
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:46,867
<font color="yellow">We'll greet her next time.
I don't think I should be there today.</font>

619
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:51,183
<font color="yellow">If my mom says something mean to you,
we'll just run away together.</font>

620
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,545
<font color="yellow">This is something we have
to go through anyways.</font>

621
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:57,111
<font color="yellow">Let's have courage.</font>

622
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:02,549
<font color="yellow">You can do it, right?</font>

623
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:10,877
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon...</font>

624
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,307
<font color="yellow">This is super expensive! It's a mink coat!</font>

625
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:20,393
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, try it on!</font>

626
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,836
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I can accept
something so expensive...</font>

627
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,049
<font color="yellow">Of course you can! Try it on!</font>

628
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:29,768
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

629
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:35,939
<font color="yellow">Mother, you look like a rich madam!</font>

630
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:40,588
<font color="yellow">I know! They say clothes
make the woman. My, my.</font>

631
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:45,010
<font color="yellow">I'll buy it for you on your birthdays, too,
randmother and Aunt Nam-yi.</font>

632
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:46,244
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

633
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:49,876
<font color="yellow">Goodness! For us, too?</font>

634
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,041
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Jang-go coming?</font>

635
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:53,268
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

636
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,877
<font color="yellow">- It's so pretty.
- He's here.</font>

637
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,870
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go!
- Hi!</font>

638
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:00,510
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

639
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:08,182
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? Who invited you here?</font>

640
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:10,283
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

641
00:48:11,237 --> 00:48:12,237
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

642
00:48:13,776 --> 00:48:15,776
<font color="yellow">We came to congratulate you for your birthday.</font>

643
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:17,346
<font color="yellow">- Congratulate me?
- Yes.</font>

644
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,870
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

645
00:48:25,878 --> 00:48:27,345
<font color="yellow">This is a present from Mi-poong.</font>

646
00:48:28,924 --> 00:48:29,924
<font color="yellow">A present?</font>

647
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:34,791
<font color="yellow">Your present to me is to disappear.</font>

648
00:48:35,464 --> 00:48:39,173
<font color="yellow">Your present to me is leaving Jang-go's side.</font>

649
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:40,198
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

650
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:45,127
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you being too harsh to someone
who came to congratulate you?
- Congratulate me?</font>

651
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:48,893
<font color="yellow">Is her way of congratulating me forcing
her way to my birthday party and ruining it?</font>

652
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:51,986
<font color="yellow">Do you have a brain or what?</font>

653
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,627
<font color="yellow">You're so stubborn.</font>

654
00:48:55,026 --> 00:48:57,533
<font color="yellow">Just a few days ago,
you got a ring from a wealthy man.</font>

655
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,986
<font color="yellow">How dare you show up here with Jang-go!</font>

656
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:01,893
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- What?</font>

657
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:04,014
<font color="yellow">Did I say something wrong?</font>

658
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:06,346
<font color="yellow">Everyone listen carefully.</font>

659
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:08,998
<font color="yellow">The woman I love is Mi-poong.</font>

660
00:49:10,026 --> 00:49:13,713
<font color="yellow">So don't call Ha-yeon to events like this one.</font>

661
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:18,893
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jang Ha-yeon, this is wrong, isn't it?</font>

662
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,768
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't make anymore
uncomfortable situations like this again.</font>

663
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go!</font>

664
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:30,002
<font color="yellow">How can you be so rude to someone I invited?</font>

665
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,266
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

666
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:34,164
<font color="yellow">We weren't invited, so we'll leave.</font>

667
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,620
<font color="yellow">Happy now?</font>

668
00:49:36,151 --> 00:49:37,151
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, wait.</font>

669
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:42,104
<font color="yellow">This is the last time I'm going to say this.</font>

670
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:45,066
<font color="yellow">If you leave this house with her,</font>

671
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:47,777
<font color="yellow">we're really over.</font>

672
00:49:49,395 --> 00:49:51,191
<font color="yellow">You won't have another chance again.</font>

673
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:52,448
<font color="yellow">A chance?</font>

674
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:53,473
<font color="yellow">What chance?</font>

675
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:58,613
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, you must think you
have something great.</font>

676
00:49:59,481 --> 00:50:01,065
<font color="yellow">But that might be nothing at all.</font>

677
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:04,832
<font color="yellow">And if I don't want it, it's not a chance.</font>

678
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:07,606
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

679
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:10,488
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

680
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:13,035
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, stop right there!</font>

681
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,731
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang, I can't do this anymore.</font>

682
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,340
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

683
00:50:18,606 --> 00:50:22,808
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon!</font>

684
00:50:25,887 --> 00:50:28,107
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon!</font>

685
00:50:31,707 --> 00:50:33,457
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

686
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:42,711
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

687
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:47,340
<font color="yellow">Seems like she still  can't give up
on that wealthy family's daughter.</font>

688
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:49,675
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is Mr. Kim's
one and only blood relative?</font>

689
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:51,606
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

690
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:53,631
<font color="yellow">No, mom! That'll never happen!</font>

691
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:57,347
<font color="yellow">Such a bat-like witch can't be
father's granddaughter!</font>

692
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:00,015
<font color="yellow">Then what's with the ring?</font>

693
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:05,941
<font color="yellow">The ring is fake! Everything is fake!
Fake! This can't be true!</font>

694
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:14,144
<font color="yellow">But why haven't you been
wearing that ring all this time?</font>

695
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:16,879
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

696
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:22,121
<font color="yellow">If you had been wearing that ring,
he would've recognized you at once.</font>

697
00:52:23,512 --> 00:52:28,214
<font color="yellow">Last time, you found his ring for him, too.</font>

698
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,980
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you notice the ring then?</font>

699
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,058
<font color="yellow">I just thought it was a similar ring.</font>

700
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:38,981
<font color="yellow">I never imagined that such
a deep story was behind it.</font>

701
00:52:40,004 --> 00:52:44,824
<font color="yellow">And even if I wanted to wear it
every day, it's too big for my finger.</font>

702
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:47,605
<font color="yellow">That's why I didn't wear it all this time.</font>

703
00:52:49,363 --> 00:52:53,572
<font color="yellow">To be honest, this ring
was too big for me that</font>

704
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:58,058
<font color="yellow">I left it in my suitcase and
forgot about it all this time.</font>

705
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:01,601
<font color="yellow">But then mother found out I was a defector.</font>

706
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:07,264
<font color="yellow">When grandfather, Hee-dong, and you were
all gone, she told me to leave the house.</font>

707
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:13,281
<font color="yellow">I was packing my things when I saw this ring.</font>

708
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:17,265
<font color="yellow">Seeing this ring...</font>

709
00:53:19,539 --> 00:53:22,718
<font color="yellow">made me think of my grandmother and father.</font>

710
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:28,078
<font color="yellow">I thought of my mom and
big brother, too. That's why I wore it.</font>

711
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:35,484
<font color="yellow">I just asked you
because I was fascinated by the</font>

712
00:53:36,273 --> 00:53:38,335
<font color="yellow">unexpected turn of events,
so don't be offended.</font>

713
00:53:39,055 --> 00:53:40,055
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

714
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:44,085
<font color="yellow">why is your name Park Shin-ae?</font>

715
00:53:47,328 --> 00:53:50,757
<font color="yellow">Your name isn't Kim Seung-hee.
Your last name isn't Kim either.</font>

716
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:53,453
<font color="yellow">Oh, that?</font>

717
00:53:54,555 --> 00:54:00,070
<font color="yellow">Well... my father was in
a high position in North Korea.</font>

718
00:54:00,953 --> 00:54:06,179
<font color="yellow">If I use my real name, I could be
in danger, so he told me to never use it.</font>

719
00:54:08,406 --> 00:54:09,414
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

720
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:10,727
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

721
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,180
<font color="yellow">From now on...</font>

722
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:24,820
<font color="yellow">we'll never use that name.</font>

723
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,156
<font color="yellow">Many North Koreans live in South Korea.</font>

724
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:32,789
<font color="yellow">Something...</font>

725
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,257
<font color="yellow">terrible might happen...</font>

726
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:41,960
<font color="yellow">so we'll all forgot about it.</font>

727
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,296
<font color="yellow">It'll be better for us to live that way.</font>

728
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:53,695
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. I understand.</font>

729
00:54:55,711 --> 00:55:02,734
<font color="yellow">You must have had a hard time
coming down here and living on your own.</font>

730
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:05,241
<font color="yellow">Grandfather...</font>

731
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,937
<font color="yellow">Yes, my granddaughter.</font>

732
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,101
<font color="yellow">My one and only blood relative.</font>

733
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:36,070
<font color="yellow">Honey. Sweetheart.</font>

734
00:55:37,373 --> 00:55:42,772
<font color="yellow">How can you tell she's father's
granddaughter with just one ring?</font>

735
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:46,624
<font color="yellow">This is wrong. This is ridiculous.</font>

736
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:52,226
<font color="yellow">There's DNA testing.</font>

737
00:55:53,422 --> 00:55:55,289
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you do that first?</font>

738
00:55:55,758 --> 00:55:59,132
<font color="yellow">Tell father to do the DNA testing first!</font>

739
00:55:59,742 --> 00:56:01,765
<font color="yellow">Don't just believe her right away!</font>

740
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,130
<font color="yellow">Do you remember this place?</font>

741
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:24,039
<font color="yellow">Do you remember what you said here, too?</font>

742
00:56:25,352 --> 00:56:26,740
<font color="yellow">What I said here?</font>

743
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:35,144
<font color="yellow">You said it was the first time you felt like
a Seoul citizen after coming to South Korea.</font>

744
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,080
<font color="yellow">You said it was the first time
you felt relaxed and happy.</font>

745
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:44,835
<font color="yellow">You said Yeong-cheol would be thankful to me.</font>

746
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:50,179
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm sorry about today.</font>

747
00:56:51,258 --> 00:56:52,458
<font color="yellow">I was thoughtless.</font>

748
00:56:53,922 --> 00:56:57,742
<font color="yellow">I was supposed to take you
after being blessed by my family.</font>

749
00:56:59,305 --> 00:57:00,476
<font color="yellow">Just wait a little bit.</font>

750
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:06,366
<font color="yellow">Instead, I'll make sure you'll be happy and
relaxed by my side for the rest of your life.</font>

751
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:10,094
<font color="yellow">Jang-go...</font>

752
00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:14,929
<font color="yellow">I'll get blessings from both our mothers...</font>

753
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,133
<font color="yellow">and then...</font>

754
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:19,958
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

755
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,132
<font color="yellow">You'll marry me, won't you?</font>

756
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,278
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

757
00:57:46,312 --> 00:57:47,312
<font color="yellow">It's pretty.</font>

758
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:18,102
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

759
00:58:19,891 --> 00:58:20,891
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon...</font>

762
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:32,187
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

763
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:37,718
<font color="yellow">You told me that you would stop liking Jang-go.</font>

764
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:41,218
<font color="yellow">Are you drinking right now?</font>

765
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:42,523
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

766
00:58:42,992 --> 00:58:44,592
<font color="yellow">Just answer my question.</font>

767
00:58:45,328 --> 00:58:46,906
<font color="yellow">Did you or did you not say that?</font>

768
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,280
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon...</font>

769
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,390
<font color="yellow">Come here right now.</font>

770
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:55,390
<font color="yellow">Come and give me an excuse or an explanation.</font>

771
00:58:57,906 --> 00:59:00,106
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why aren't you answering me?</font>

772
00:59:00,547 --> 00:59:01,859
<font color="yellow">Come right now!</font>

773
00:59:02,211 --> 00:59:03,562
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

774
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:04,719
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

775
00:59:06,406 --> 00:59:09,039
<font color="yellow">Jang Ha-yeon, if you have
something to say, call me.</font>

776
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:11,742
<font color="yellow">Put Kim Mi-poong on the phone.</font>

777
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,950
<font color="yellow">You're very drunk.</font>

778
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:15,539
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

779
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,640
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, how can you just hang up on her?</font>

780
00:59:23,992 --> 00:59:26,200
<font color="yellow">You don't have to answer. She's really drunk.</font>

781
00:59:30,727 --> 00:59:31,999
<font color="yellow">Hi, Ha-yeon. It's me.</font>

782
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:34,820
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll come right now.</font>

783
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:40,350
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, go home first.
I'm going to go see Ha-yeon.</font>

784
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:43,670
<font color="yellow">Then I'll go. It'll be better that way.</font>

785
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:11,742
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

786
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,265
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

787
01:00:19,234 --> 01:00:21,890
<font color="yellow">She's really pissing me off.</font>

788
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:25,869
<font color="yellow">Did I tell you to come?</font>

789
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,131
<font color="yellow">I won't let her get away with this.</font>

790
01:00:29,164 --> 01:00:31,031
<font color="yellow">Hey. Get a hold of yourself.</font>

791
01:00:31,056 --> 01:00:32,522
<font color="yellow">How dare you touch me!</font>

792
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,250
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

793
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:42,549
<font color="yellow">Don't say my name.</font>

794
01:00:43,445 --> 01:00:45,232
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

795
01:00:46,508 --> 01:00:48,441
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll take you home.</font>

<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go.</font>

797
01:00:51,406 --> 01:00:53,390
<font color="yellow">Where are your eyes?</font>

798
01:00:54,242 --> 01:00:57,042
<font color="yellow">How can you have such low taste for women?</font>

799
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:02,179
<font color="yellow">You think you're so special
because I like you, huh?</font>

800
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:04,317
<font color="yellow">Don't make me laugh.</font>

801
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,046
<font color="yellow">I hate you now.</font>

802
01:01:10,414 --> 01:01:12,614
<font color="yellow">But the heartbreak you gave me...</font>

803
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:16,717
<font color="yellow">I'll always remember that.</font>

804
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:20,875
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget it.</font>

805
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,375
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

806
01:01:35,578 --> 01:01:36,778

- Let go!</font>

807
01:01:37,078 --> 01:01:40,249
