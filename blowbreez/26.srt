- It's a famous hospital in America.</font>

20
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:37,245
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon's father came earlier and told us
he got in touch with a professor from there.</font>

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,224
<font color="yellow">She can get a complete medical
examination over there to find out the</font>

22
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:44,863
<font color="yellow">reason why her legs are paralyzed
and find a way for her to get better.</font>

23
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:52,808
<font color="yellow">So how about you go with her?</font>

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

25
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:57,112
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can help her.</font>

26
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:00,074
<font color="yellow">No, mother. I'm okay.</font>

27
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,722
<font color="yellow">You're not okay.</font>

28
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:04,433
<font color="yellow">How can you go somewhere so far by yourself?</font>

29
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,141
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, will you be okay with this?</font>

30
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:13,216
<font color="yellow">If you go with me, I won't be nervous,
and I think you'll be able to support me.</font>

31
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:16,911
<font color="yellow">Is there really a possibility
for you to get better over there?</font>

32
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,412
<font color="yellow">I want to do anything if there's hope.</font>

33
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:22,778
<font color="yellow">Even if the possibility is only one percent.</font>

34
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:27,433
<font color="yellow">Of course! You should do anything you can!</font>

35
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,621
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

36
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,718
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll do it.</font>

37
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:35,243
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.</font>

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,910
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

39
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,847
<font color="yellow">Are you serious, Jang-go?</font>

40
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:43,972
<font color="yellow">You made a good decision, Jang-go.</font>

41
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:51,277
<font color="yellow">Engagement?</font>

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,523
<font color="yellow">Why would he get engaged to her when
she's paralyzed and can't even get up?</font>

43
00:02:57,738 --> 00:03:02,483
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon wants to get treatment in America,
so Jang-go decided to go with her.</font>

44
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:06,759
<font color="yellow">That's why it'll be better for them
to get engaged before they go.</font>

45
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:08,439
<font color="yellow">Did Jang-go say he would go?</font>

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,910
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

47
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:13,239
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, are you out of your mind?</font>

48
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:19,169
<font color="yellow">You want Jang-go to get married to someone
who might be handicapped her whole life?</font>

49
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:21,746
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon will get better. Don't worry.</font>

50
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:23,442
<font color="yellow">Are you a doctor?</font>

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,089
<font color="yellow">Are you God?</font>

52
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:29,417
<font color="yellow">There's no guarantee that she will get better.</font>

53
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:35,058
<font color="yellow">You want to give our precious
Jang-go to such a woman?</font>

54
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:40,048
<font color="yellow">She got hurt because of Jang-go,
so how can we just ignore her?</font>

55
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:43,261
<font color="yellow">If you saw how much pain Ha-yeon is in,</font>

56
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,605
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't be able to say this.</font>

57
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:51,909
<font color="yellow">It's not like Jang-go pushed her into the car.
She was drunk and got hurt on her own.</font>

58
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,832
<font color="yellow">Why should Jang-go
have to take responsibility?</font>

59
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:56,783
<font color="yellow">Do you hate Ha-yeon that much?</font>

60
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:00,105
<font color="yellow">Why are you twisting my words?</font>

61
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,794
<font color="yellow">When did I say I hated her?</font>

62
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:10,566
<font color="yellow">I like Ha-yeon, too, but to me,
Jang-go comes before her!</font>

63
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,128
<font color="yellow">Are you really a mother?</font>

64
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:16,769
<font color="yellow">Even if Jang-go said he would do this,
you should've stopped him.</font>

65
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:22,300
<font color="yellow">Do you care more for that family's son-in-law
position than your own son's happiness?</font>

66
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,457
<font color="yellow">Mother, you're being too harsh.</font>

67
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,160
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this for a reason.</font>

68
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,480
<font color="yellow">I would never do anything that
would damage Jang-go's life.</font>

69
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,147
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. You guys are going to fight at this point.
- What?</font>

70
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:37,325
<font color="yellow">What? Damage?</font>

71
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,855
<font color="yellow">Are you using Jang-go for business?</font>

72
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:46,150
<font color="yellow">So you're going to sell Jang-go for money?</font>

73
00:04:46,582 --> 00:04:50,355
<font color="yellow">You've gone mad for money!</font>

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,876
<font color="yellow">Yes! I've gone mad! All I see is money!</font>

75
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:56,761
<font color="yellow">What do we have?</font>

76
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,215
<font color="yellow">We don't even have the
ability to buy them a house!</font>

77
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,229
<font color="yellow">That's why you shouldn't
meddle into my affairs.</font>

78
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:05,346
<font color="yellow">Whether I sell my son or not,
it's up to me. He's my son!</font>

79
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:10,402
<font color="yellow">- What? Are you talking back to me?
- Grandma!</font>

80
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:16,099
<font color="yellow">- Hey! You despicable wench!
What do you take me for?
- Mom, what's wrong with you?</font>

81
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:19,973
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! You despicable wench!</font>

82
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:26,925
<font color="yellow">Is that all you have to say?
You! You! Get out of this house right now!</font>

83
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,473
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Grandma!</font>

84
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,570
<font color="yellow">- You horrible witch!
- Mom, go to your room.</font>

85
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:34,660
<font color="yellow">- That wench!
- Mom, I told you to stop it!</font>

86
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:39,082
<font color="yellow">Goodness! And she calls herself a mother?</font>

87
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:54,418
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

88
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:56,933
<font color="yellow">I can't get weak now.</font>

89
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:03,089
<font color="yellow">When time passes, they'll understand me.</font>

90
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,378
<font color="yellow">You broke up with him?</font>

91
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,535
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

92
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:13,832
<font color="yellow">Time will heal everything.</font>

93
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:17,363
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

94
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:20,933
<font color="yellow">you should take off this ring now.</font>

95
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:27,824
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

96
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,457
<font color="yellow">I'll take it off a little bit later.</font>

97
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,869
<font color="yellow">I can't take it off right now.</font>

98
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,035
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

99
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,426
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

100
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:46,198
<font color="yellow">As time passes by,
you'll naturally take it off.</font>

101
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,575
<font color="yellow">You can keep it on.</font>

102
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:22,121
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

103
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,621
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

104
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,082
<font color="yellow">Why are you sleeping here?</font>

105
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,449
<font color="yellow">I was just going to take
a break, but I fell asleep.</font>

106
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:38,258
<font color="yellow">It's already this late? I have to
meet someone. I'll be back.</font>

107
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:43,981
<font color="yellow">What about lunch?</font>

108
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,842
<font color="yellow">I can eat outside.</font>

109
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:52,283
<font color="yellow">I'm going shopping with mother today.
Do you need anything?</font>

110
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:54,784
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

111
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:56,557
<font color="yellow">I don't think I do.</font>

112
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,929
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going to choose for you.</font>

113
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,473
<font color="yellow">I like anything you choose for me.</font>

114
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:02,932
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

115
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,911
<font color="yellow">- Hee-dong, are you going out?
- Yes, I  have plans.</font>

116
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,690
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

117
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,010
<font color="yellow">Are you ready? Let's go out.</font>

118
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:18,119
<font color="yellow">You can go out first.
I'll be out after I get ready.</font>

119
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,401
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

120
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:28,346
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the car first and
turn the heater on! Take your time!</font>

121
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:37,971
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! You have such a nice
figure that it looks good on you, too!</font>

122
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:38,996
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

123
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:46,780
<font color="yellow">That will look good on you, too.</font>

124
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:50,344
<font color="yellow">How can everything look good on you?</font>

125
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:56,940
<font color="yellow">You have a call.</font>

126
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,107
<font color="yellow">Please take my phone out.</font>

127
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:04,775
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

128
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,501
<font color="yellow">(Grandfather)</font>

129
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,218
<font color="yellow">Hi, grandfather.</font>

130
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,874
<font color="yellow">I'm shopping with mother right now.</font>

131
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:21,054
<font color="yellow">I bought a nice cardigan and
tie for you, so come home early.</font>

132
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:22,635
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

133
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:39,088
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Did you guys go shopping?</font>

134
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,032
<font color="yellow">Yes, mom. Shin-ae said she had
a lot of things to buy.</font>

135
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:48,135
<font color="yellow">But why are you carrying these for her?
Are you her servant?</font>

136
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,517
<font color="yellow">It's not like that, mom!</font>

137
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:54,175
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, you said you were tired, right? I'll</font>

138
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,850
<font color="yellow">take these up for you,
so go upstairs and rest.</font>

139
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:02,210
<font color="yellow">Yes. My feet hurt.
I think I should do that, mother.</font>

140
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,235
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

141
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:04,838
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

142
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,541
<font color="yellow">"I think I should do that?"</font>

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,322
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, grandmother?</font>

144
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:13,760
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to your mother-in-law?</font>

145
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:18,861
<font color="yellow">I see. Are you playing the top dog now?</font>

146
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,237
<font color="yellow">Grandmother...</font>

147
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:23,867
<font color="yellow">- Mom, what's wrong?
- You stay put!</font>

148
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,588
<font color="yellow">They say a no good person acts up!</font>

149
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:31,489
<font color="yellow">Are you using your mother-in-law
as your servant now?</font>

00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,143
<font color="yellow">How dare you act so rudely!</font>

151
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,698
<font color="yellow">- How dare you!
- Mom!</font>

152
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:39,908
<font color="yellow">That's enough!</font>

153
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,057
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja,</font>

154
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,244
<font color="yellow">what is going on?</font>

155
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:56,252
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, you tell me.</font>

156
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:57,929
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

157
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,135
<font color="yellow">Grandfather...</font>

158
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,541
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

159
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,533
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

160
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:11,190
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, what are you doing?</font>

161
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,592
<font color="yellow">Even before they got married,
you hated her,</font>

162
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:17,604
<font color="yellow">so you opposed her,
scolded her, and ruined her face.</font>

163
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:21,154
<font color="yellow">Do you still hate Shin-ae so much?</font>

164
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,675
<font color="yellow">No! It's not like that!</font>

165
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,651
<font color="yellow">You know better than anyone
what Shin-ae means to me!</font>

166
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:35,463
<font color="yellow">You can't even treat her warmly like she's
your daughter! How can you do this to her?</font>

167
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,831
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, it's not like that.
What happened was-</font>

168
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:39,773
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't act like that either!</font>

169
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:43,604
<font color="yellow">If your daughter did something wrong,
you should talk to her.</font>

170
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,140
<font color="yellow">How can you play along with her?</font>

171
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:47,308
<font color="yellow">I beg your pardon?</font>

172
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:52,079
<font color="yellow">I was really treating Shin-ae
like she was my daughter.</font>

173
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:55,261
<font color="yellow">There was a misunderstanding!</font>

174
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,464
<font color="yellow">Forget it!</font>

175
00:11:57,574 --> 00:12:01,831
<font color="yellow">How can we live under the same roof
when you hate Shin-ae so much?</font>

176
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:07,526
<font color="yellow">If you hate her, you should
move out of this house.</font>

177
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,542
<font color="yellow">I'll live with Hee-dong and Shin-ae.</font>

178
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,269
<font color="yellow">No! I don't hate Shin-ae!</font>

179
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,229
<font color="yellow">You horrible people.</font>

180
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:46,538
<font color="yellow">How can he change so much
after he found his granddaughter?</font>

181
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:52,667
<font color="yellow">How can he do this to you when you served
him like he was your parent all this time?</font>

182
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,308
<font color="yellow">He told me I'm playing along with you!</font>

183
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:07,323
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

184
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:39,810
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, just carry Ha-yeon. The wheelchair
can't go over the high doorstep anyways.</font>

185
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:41,808
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

186
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,639
<font color="yellow">Careful.</font>

187
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,068
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

188
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,077
<font color="yellow">Careful.</font>

189
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:02,646
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy to be
invited to your friend's house?</font>

190
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,646
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm so happy!</font>

191
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:11,667
<font color="yellow">Listen to the adults. You know you
shouldn't run around in their house, right?</font>

192
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,232
<font color="yellow">Aunt, don't worry.</font>

193
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,779
<font color="yellow">I have that much common sense.</font>

194
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:18,506
<font color="yellow">What? Common sense?</font>

195
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,222
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn that word?</font>

196
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:22,514
<font color="yellow">Kids these days use that word.</font>

197
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:23,951
<font color="yellow">"Kids these days?"</font>

198
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,756
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! You're adorable!</font>

199
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:32,623
<font color="yellow">Then have common sense when you play
with your friends until I pick you up later.</font>

200
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,931
<font color="yellow">Okay. Aunt, we're going to be late.</font>

201
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:35,956
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

202
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:39,389
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo! Nam-yi! Mother!</font>

203
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,178
<font color="yellow">Yes, mom!</font>

204
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:44,928
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

205
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:47,811
<font color="yellow">We can see you at the engagement.
Why did you come here?</font>

206
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,701
<font color="yellow">She must be heavy. Go in, Jang-go.</font>

207
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:53,226
<font color="yellow">- That's right. Jang-go will be tired.
Go in. Jang-soo, take these.
- Sure, mom.</font>

208
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,381
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

209
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,175
<font color="yellow">Take the wheelchair.</font>

210
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,316
<font color="yellow">Be careful when you go inside.</font>

211
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:03,154
<font color="yellow">Aunt, what's wrong?</font>

212
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:08,725
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Let's go.</font>

213
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,257
<font color="yellow">This is Chinese quince tea.</font>

214
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,407
<font color="yellow">I made it. Drink it.</font>

215
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:17,011
<font color="yellow">Thank you, mother.</font>

216
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:22,264
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I'm the only one sitting like this.</font>

217
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,896
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be. It would've
been nice if we had a stand-up table.</font>

218
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:29,841
<font color="yellow">Should we put a sofa in here
and change the interior?</font>

219
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:35,395
<font color="yellow">You're not feeling well.
You didn't have to come all the way here.</font>

220
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,933
<font color="yellow">No, I'm a lot better now.</font>

221
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:43,120
<font color="yellow">And if we get engaged and go to America,
I won't be able to come here often.</font>

222
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:47,359
<font color="yellow">We should be grateful she came to visit us.</font>

223
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,730
<font color="yellow">I hope you get better over there.</font>

224
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:50,965
<font color="yellow">Get well soon.</font>

225
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,199
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll get well.</font>

226
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,230
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm going.</font>

227
00:15:57,855 --> 00:16:01,909
<font color="yellow">Yes. If you go with such a mindset,
you'll be able to get better.</font>

228
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,608
<font color="yellow">I don't feel very well,
so I'm going to go rest.</font>

229
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:11,746
<font color="yellow">Have a good time.</font>

230
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:13,676
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

231
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,125
<font color="yellow">She doesn't feel very well.</font>

232
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,404
<font color="yellow">What are you up to?</font>

233
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,537
<font color="yellow">Is that kiwi juice?</font>

234
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,551
<font color="yellow">Yes. Shin-ae likes this.</font>

235
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

236
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,820
<font color="yellow">You're going to give this
to that devious witch and</font>

237
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:35,767
<font color="yellow">not your mom who is dealing with constipation?</font>

238
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,277
<font color="yellow">I told him that she's like a daughter
to me. What else can I do?</font>

239
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,263
<font color="yellow">I have to pretend to be nice to her.</font>

240
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:46,945
<font color="yellow">How can you do this after you
went through that? You're too nice.</font>

241
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,177
<font color="yellow">I already feel upset as it is,
so you don't have to add onto it!</font>

242
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:57,464
<font color="yellow">I want to spit into her drink!</font>

243
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,356
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's that?</font>

244
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,575
<font color="yellow">Mom, what did you put in there?</font>

245
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,871
<font color="yellow">Constipation medicine.</font>

246
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:15,470
<font color="yellow">I need to get my revenge this way at least!</font>

247
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,372
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, what are you doing?</font>

248
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:28,197
<font color="yellow">No, don't get up.</font>

249
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,837
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

250
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,423
<font color="yellow">It's gold kiwi juice.</font>

251
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:39,238
<font color="yellow">It's good for preventing constipation
and making your skin healthy.</font>

252
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:46,501
<font color="yellow">I felt bad about yelling at you when
I could've just talked nicely to you.</font>

253
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,850
<font color="yellow">Is that why the two of you
came in here together?</font>

254
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:52,697
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to.</font>

255
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:57,527
<font color="yellow">My mom suggested I make this
for you. I made it myself, so drink up.</font>

256
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,517
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

257
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,767
<font color="yellow">Okay. Drink up.</font>

258
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,603
<font color="yellow">My stomach hurts.</font>

259
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,056
<font color="yellow">Mother, you should just drink this.</font>

260
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:23,487
<font color="yellow">No, no, no. I brought this
for you to drink. You drink it.</font>

261
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,750
<font color="yellow">No, thank you. I appreciate
your efforts, but I think</font>

262
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,593
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get
a stomachache if I drink this.</font>

263
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,115
<font color="yellow">I must have ate too many cold foods today.</font>

264
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,142
<font color="yellow">Mother, drink it.</font>

265
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,162
<font color="yellow">Sure, I'll drink it!</font>

266
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,790
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

267
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,236
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja...</font>

268
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,486
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!</font>

269
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:02,494
<font color="yellow">My poor daughter!</font>

270
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,134
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

271
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,290
<font color="yellow">I'm in front of your house right now.</font>

272
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:21,124
<font color="yellow">I brought someone you would be happy
to see. Hurry up and come out.</font>

273
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,094
<font color="yellow">Someone I would be happy to see?</font>

274
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,096
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

275
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:48,025
<font color="yellow">I came with Yoo-Jin.
Aren't you happy to see her?</font>

276
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,174
<font color="yellow">Yoo-Jin, say hello.
You know auntie, don't you?</font>

277
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,119
<font color="yellow">Hello, aunt.</font>

278
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,933
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be this way?</font>

279
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:08,827
<font color="yellow">Look here, Kang Mi-Jung.</font>

280
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,119
<font color="yellow">I have to send Yoo-Jin to school.
I want to send her to a nice school here.</font>

281
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,439
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so upset?</font>

282
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,972
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be this way?</font>

283
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:30,829
<font color="yellow">Leave here! Go wait somewhere
for me! I'll be there soon!</font>

284
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,049
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

285
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you outside?</font>

286
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,666
<font color="yellow">Grandfather.</font>

287
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:44,861
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

288
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:49,033
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

289
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:50,471
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

290
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,353
<font color="yellow">The thing is, grandfather...</font>

291
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:59,113
<font color="yellow">she's the woman who gave me a lot of
help when I was having trouble in China.</font>

292
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:00,447
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

293
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:04,908
<font color="yellow">She has a child with her,
so why is she standing outside?</font>

294
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:09,312
<font color="yellow">They're visiting Korea and just
dropped by. They were just leaving now.</font>

295
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,150
<font color="yellow">She saved you. You can't just let her go.</font>

296
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:18,290
<font color="yellow">Come in. I'm grateful to you
for helping my granddaughter.</font>

297
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,579
<font color="yellow">You should at least have
a cup of tea before you go.</font>

298
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,864
<font color="yellow">Granddaughter? Not granddaughter-in-law?</font>

299
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:26,423
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

300
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:29,837
<font color="yellow">Come inside.</font>

301
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:31,815
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

302
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:33,572
<font color="yellow">Kang Yoo-Jin.</font>

303
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,259
<font color="yellow">Kang Yoo-Jin?</font>

304
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:39,650
<font color="yellow">I see. Come on. Let's go inside.</font>

305
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,681
<font color="yellow">You can't call me Kang Mi-Jung.</font>

306
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:59,548
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, why are you just standing there?
Escort the guest inside.</font>

307
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:02,721
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather!</font>

308
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:10,001
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a place to stay?
- I'm staying somewhere nearby.</font>

309
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,900
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

310
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:15,056
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

311
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:19,632
<font color="yellow">Isn't she the woman from last time?</font>

312
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,908
<font color="yellow">But why is she inside our house?</font>

313
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,165
<font color="yellow">Does this woman know her weakness?</font>

314
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:30,915
<font color="yellow">How old are you, baby?</font>

315
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,704
<font color="yellow">I'm not a baby.</font>

316
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:34,356
<font color="yellow">I'm seven years old.</font>

317
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:35,381
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

318
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:40,528
<font color="yellow">That's right. If you're seven years old,
you're not a baby.</font>

319
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:43,561
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for calling you a baby.</font>

320
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:47,169
<font color="yellow">But you don't look like your mom at all.</font>

321
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,603
<font color="yellow">I look like my dad.</font>

322
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:52,346
<font color="yellow">Your dad?</font>

323
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,346
<font color="yellow">Where is your dad?</font>

324
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,689
<font color="yellow">I separated from her dad a long time ago.</font>

325
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,436
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

326
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,958
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, drink your tea.
You drink your tea, too, aunt.</font>

327
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,327
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

328
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:16,057
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for
helping my granddaughter out</font>

329
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:20,225
<font color="yellow">when she was going through difficult times.</font>

330
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,500
<font color="yellow">We must help each other as fellow countrymen.</font>

331
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,592
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is this old man's granddaughter?</font>

332
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,018
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

333
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:35,206
<font color="yellow">But how do the two of you know each other?</font>

334
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,080
<font color="yellow">Oh, us?</font>

335
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,978
<font color="yellow">Well, we knew each other in
North Korea, but we met again in China.</font>

336
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:48,721
<font color="yellow">You knew Shin-ae when she was in North Korea?</font>

337
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:55,228
<font color="yellow">Then do you know Kim Soon-ok's son
Kim Dae-hoon as well?</font>

338
00:23:55,822 --> 00:24:00,666
<font color="yellow">Kim Soon-ok's son Kim Dae-hoon?
Oh, you mean Seung-hee's father?</font>

339
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:07,291
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's my son. He's Seung-hee's father.</font>

340
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:10,761
<font color="yellow">What on earth is he talking about?</font>

341
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,472
<font color="yellow">"Seung-hee's father?"</font>

342
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:18,783
<font color="yellow">Do you remember my father?</font>

343
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:20,673
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

344
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:24,130
<font color="yellow">Is she pretending to be Seung-hee?</font>

345
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:29,798
<font color="yellow">Well, I do know him,
but it's been much too long.</font>

346
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:40,556
<font color="yellow">Still, I'm happy to meet someone
who knows my son's name.</font>

347
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:44,740
<font color="yellow">I just thought she was
this family's daughter-in-law,</font>

348
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:47,963
<font color="yellow">but she turned out to be your granddaughter.</font>

349
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,416
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since I found her.</font>

350
00:24:52,314 --> 00:24:55,009
<font color="yellow">I met her as my distant
relative's daughter-in-law.</font>

351
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:59,729
<font color="yellow">But I found out she was my granddaughter
whom I've been searching for.</font>

352
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,611
<font color="yellow">The heavens helped us meet.</font>

353
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:09,072
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Goodness! Goodness! What a miracle!</font>

354
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:13,962
<font color="yellow">Oh, Shin-ae, I'm so happy for you!</font>

355
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:17,400
<font color="yellow">You got to meet your grandfather!</font>

356
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,061
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kang Mi-Jung!</font>

357
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,834
<font color="yellow">You're pretending to be Young-ae's
daughter Kim Seung-hee, aren't you?</font>

358
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:46,448
<font color="yellow">Why are you glaring at me
when you played along with me?</font>

359
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:54,275
<font color="yellow">You've got some nerves!</font>

360
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:58,007
<font color="yellow">Aren't you scared of the
heavens after deceiving blood ties?</font>

361
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:06,048
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee's family died,
so why can't I do this?</font>

362
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:10,486
<font color="yellow">Grandfather gets to be happy
with his granddaughter.</font>

363
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:14,610
<font color="yellow">Thanks to that, I can live
a decent life in South Korea.</font>

364
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:18,517
<font color="yellow">Yoo-Jin and you will be
able to live a carefree life</font>

365
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:21,622
<font color="yellow">from now on. So is the heavens
a big deal right now?</font>

366
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:31,298
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes. Who cares if you're Kang Mi-Jung,
Park Shin-ae, or Kim Seung-hee?</font>

367
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:35,117
<font color="yellow">As long as you give me money,
I'm happy. Right?</font>

368
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:45,181
<font color="yellow">Take this, and don't contact me
until I contact you first.</font>

369
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:47,096
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

370
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:49,978
<font color="yellow">But Shin-ae, hurry up.</font>

371
00:26:50,572 --> 00:26:53,045
<font color="yellow">I need money urgently. Got it?</font>

372
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,072
<font color="yellow">Yoo-Jin, let's go!</font>

373
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,626
<font color="yellow">Yoo-Jin, let's go eat something yummy!</font>

374
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,580
<font color="yellow">This is all I have right now!</font>

375
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:40,986
<font color="yellow">If they find out I'm a North Korean defector,
it'll be the end of us!</font>

376
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,830
<font color="yellow">That woman clearly threatened
Shin-ae to get money from her.</font>

377
00:27:47,962 --> 00:27:50,342
<font color="yellow">But why is she calling that woman "aunt?"</font>

378
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:54,173
<font color="yellow">Something is strange. Something is fishy.</font>

379
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,189
<font color="yellow">Who on earth is Shin-ae?</font>

380
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,700
<font color="yellow">What are you mumbling to yourself about?</font>

381
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,395
<font color="yellow">Is Shin-ae really father's granddaughter?</font>

382
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:15,744
<font color="yellow">I really feel like she isn't, honey.</font>

383
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:19,205
<font color="yellow">You woman! What are you talking about?</font>

384
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:26,846
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard it was to
find out the name of Elder's son?</font>

385
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,682
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much money we spent on this?</font>

386
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:35,157
<font color="yellow">We barely found out, and yet,
Shin-ae knew it right away!</font>

387
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,494
<font color="yellow">On top of that, she said her grandmother's
name and she has the ring, too!</font>

388
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,041
<font color="yellow">What more do you need to know?</font>

389
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:43,536
<font color="yellow">They can't be checked through DNA testing.</font>

390
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:48,017
<font color="yellow">And my instinct keeps
saying she's not the one.</font>

391
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,681
<font color="yellow">But why are you getting so angry?</font>

392
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,892
<font color="yellow">How can I not get angry?</font>

393
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,955
<font color="yellow">Elder spent his whole life searching for his</font>

394
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,213
<font color="yellow">blood relative, and now he finally found her!</font>

395
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,929
<font color="yellow">Can't you see how Elder is smiling
every day because of Shin-ae?</font>

396
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,822
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You look like an evil granny!</font>

397
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,048
<font color="yellow">What? An evil granny?</font>

398
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,783
<font color="yellow">Hey! Jo Dal-ho!</font>

399
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,869
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, hold on.</font>

400
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:30,484
<font color="yellow">I want some fresh air.
Can we walk around a bit?</font>

401
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:33,956
<font color="yellow">Yes, Jang-go.
Ha-yeon must have felt frustrated</font>

402
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,967
<font color="yellow">in the hospital room. Go on and do that.</font>

403
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,866
<font color="yellow">It's a bit chilly.</font>

404
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:42,447
<font color="yellow">- Will you be okay?
- Yes, I want to do it.</font>

405
00:29:44,197 --> 00:29:45,955
<font color="yellow">Mother, go inside first.</font>

406
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:50,211
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll go in first,
so you two have a good time.</font>

407
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,769
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you tomorrow.</font>

408
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:52,927
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

409
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:55,095
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go.
- Okay.</font>

410
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:10,947
<font color="yellow">Yes. Jang-go will develop feelings
for her if he keeps being with her.</font>

411
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:18,837
<font color="yellow">- Here?
- Right there.</font>

412
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,517
<font color="yellow">It feels great!</font>

413
00:30:20,978 --> 00:30:26,095
<font color="yellow">But Jang-soo, what do you do at the theater
that you always have to put on patches?</font>

414
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,719
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're building sets every day.</font>

415
00:30:28,821 --> 00:30:32,740
<font color="yellow">Well, there's something wrong
with the set, so we have to rebuild it.</font>

416
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,467
<font color="yellow">When will you be able to succeed
from being a stage actor?</font>

417
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:40,666
<font color="yellow">Just wait a little bit longer.</font>

418
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,786
<font color="yellow">My baby, you said you would understand me.</font>

419
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:46,414
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

420
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,765
<font color="yellow">But Jang-soo, don't you
think something is strange?</font>

421
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:52,563
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

422
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:54,781
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about Ha-yeon.</font>

423
00:30:55,671 --> 00:31:01,086
<font color="yellow">If I was in her shoes,
I'd want to die, but she's too normal.</font>

424
00:31:01,508 --> 00:31:04,664
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what if she's purposely
lying when her legs are fine?</font>

425
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:06,305
<font color="yellow">Come on, Hee-ra.</font>

426
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,273
<font color="yellow">Forget it! I was just saying!</font>

427
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,625
<font color="yellow">Still, how can you say such a thing?</font>

428
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,621
<font color="yellow">She must be so tormented inside.</font>

429
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,675
<font color="yellow">Watching her purposely
hide her true feelings and act</font>

430
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,188
<font color="yellow">so cheerful actually
made me feel sorry for her.</font>

431
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,941
<font color="yellow">Right? No one in this world
would make up such a lie.</font>

432
00:31:24,203 --> 00:31:25,470
<font color="yellow">- Of course.
- Right?</font>

433
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:27,878
<font color="yellow">- Yes. So don't think like that.
- All right. I'm sorry.</font>

434
00:31:42,516 --> 00:31:43,516
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

435
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:48,187
<font color="yellow">It's warm. Thanks, Jang-go.</font>

436
00:31:51,438 --> 00:31:54,438
<font color="yellow">There aren't many days we can spend in Korea.</font>

437
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:58,461
<font color="yellow">It'll be difficult for us to come back
to Korea for a while, huh?</font>

438
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,961
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

439
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:06,886
<font color="yellow">I didn't know there was such a place
in your neighborhood. It's so nice here.</font>

440
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,173
<font color="yellow">The smell of autumn! It's so nice!</font>

441
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:30,065
<font color="yellow"><i>I loved and wanted you</i></font>

442
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:36,738
<font color="yellow"><i>Because I live inside your memories</i></font>

443
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,557
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, do you want to smell this, too?</font>

444
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:44,480
<font color="yellow"><i>In the love that has already passed</i></font>

445
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,518
<font color="yellow"><i>I need to fill up my tired heart</i></font>

446
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:51,365
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's wrong?</font>

447
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:55,523
<font color="yellow">You'll catch a cold. Let's go.</font>

448
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:58,560
<font color="yellow"><i>But where are you?</i></font>

449
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:33,633
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

450
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:40,445
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and sit down.</font>

451
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:47,458
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell me?</font>

452
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:53,090
<font color="yellow">I don't feel right about this.</font>

453
00:33:54,711 --> 00:34:01,844
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to get
engaged to Ha-yeon tomorrow?</font>

454
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:03,836
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

455
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:07,843
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to, tell me the truth.</font>

456
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:13,466
<font color="yellow">After the engagement, you won't
be able to change your mind.</font>

457
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:19,880
<font color="yellow">If you have someone else in your heart,
but you're doing this because</font>

458
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,537
<font color="yellow">you have no choice or because
your mother wants you to do this,</font>

459
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,291
<font color="yellow">tell me that this is an engagement
that you don't want.</font>

460
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:34,248
<font color="yellow">Then, no matter what I do, I'll make
sure this engagement won't happen.</font>

461
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,084
<font color="yellow">No, grandma.</font>

462
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:44,318
<font color="yellow">I was the one who decided
to do this engagement.</font>

463
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,451
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

464
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:49,951
<font color="yellow">Have you really decided to do this?</font>

465
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:52,569
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

466
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:58,435
<font color="yellow">If you think so, then there's
nothing I can do about it.</font>

467
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:02,717
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

468
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:09,679
<font color="yellow">After I send you to America, how will I live?</font>

469
00:35:17,147 --> 00:35:18,147
<font color="yellow">Jang-go,</font>

470
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:21,420
<font color="yellow">you need to keep this in mind.</font>

471
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:28,521
<font color="yellow">Whatever you decide to do, I'm always
on your side. Don't forget that.</font>

472
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:30,569
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

473
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:43,607
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee and Mr. Jang's daughter
is getting engaged today?</font>

474
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,287
<font color="yellow">How can he leave Mi-poong behind
and get engaged to another woman?</font>

475
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:49,506
<font color="yellow">I was hoping things would work out for them.</font>

476
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:50,646
<font color="yellow">Poor Mi-poong.</font>

477
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,365
<font color="yellow">- Ready?
- Yes.</font>

478
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:01,577
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the atmosphere?
Let's start the meeting.</font>

479
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:02,865
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

480
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:20,904
<font color="yellow">First of all, I would like
to thank Lee Jang-go...</font>

481
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:24,334
<font color="yellow">for deciding to be with
Ha-yeon even though her future</font>

482
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,246
<font color="yellow">has become unclear
after her car accident.</font>

483
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:32,698
<font color="yellow">And I would also like to thank his family for</font>

484
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,972
<font color="yellow">allowing him to go through with his decision.</font>

485
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,659
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, thank you.</font>

486
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,187
<font color="yellow">Please be good to Ha-yeon.</font>

487
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,206
<font color="yellow">Please say a word, Ms. Hwang.</font>

488
00:36:58,855 --> 00:37:02,605
<font color="yellow">I believe Ha-yeon will get well.</font>

489
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,105
<font color="yellow">I know she'll return healthy
after getting treatment in America.</font>

490
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:16,714
<font color="yellow">I hope Ha-yeon, who is like a daughter
to me, and Jang-go will live happily together.</font>

491
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:24,644
<font color="yellow">Then let's make a toast to bless their future.</font>

492
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,691
<font color="yellow">To Jang-go and Ha-yeon's future. Cheers!</font>

493
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:32,284
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

494
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,754
<font color="yellow">- Let's congratulate them.
- Sure!</font>

495
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:47,256
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, congratulations.</font>

496
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:51,991
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, congratulations.</font>

497
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:53,323
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

498
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:55,947
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Mr. Jang.</font>

499
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

500
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:26,495
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

501
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:27,714
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

502
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:32,167
<font color="yellow">- Ha-yeon, you can walk?
- What happened?</font>

503
00:38:32,972 --> 00:38:35,292
<font color="yellow">You can walk, but you lied?</font>

504
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,847
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

505
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,886
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

506
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

507
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,050
<font color="yellow">You could walk?</font>

508
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,130
<font color="yellow">Mother, what do I do?</font>

509
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,401
<font color="yellow">So the thing is...</font>

510
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:58,354
<font color="yellow">You knew about this, too?</font>

511
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,651
<font color="yellow">Let me explain everything.</font>

512
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,519
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

513
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,980
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

514
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:22,323
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

515
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,862
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

516
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,910
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

517
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,106
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I'm sorry.</font>

518
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,793
<font color="yellow">But I wanted to hold you back.</font>

519
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:36,690
<font color="yellow">Can't you understand
my feelings just this once?</font>

520
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:45,026
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, we didn't have bad intentions.</font>

521
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:49,136
<font color="yellow">Do you think I would have done
this if things hadn't been so terrible?</font>

522
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:51,953
<font color="yellow">Don't get angry, and listen to me. Please?</font>

523
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:57,246
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

524
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,578
<font color="yellow">the two of you set this up to fool me?</font>

525
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:06,785
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

526
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:14,761
<font color="yellow">I hurt the woman I love to go to Ha-yeon.</font>

527
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,444
<font color="yellow">You two won't have any idea how I felt.</font>

528
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,116
<font color="yellow">But that was all a lie.</font>

529
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:28,460
<font color="yellow">Mom, how can you do this to me?</font>

530
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,016
<font color="yellow">Don't hold me back.</font>

531
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,972
<font color="yellow">You! If I had been younger
and had more energy,</font>

532
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,611
<font color="yellow">I would've kicked you out of this house today!</font>

533
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:08,210
<font color="yellow">And you call yourself a mother?</font>

534
00:41:08,695 --> 00:41:13,382
<font color="yellow">How can you drive a nail into
your own child's heart?</font>

535
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,616
<font color="yellow">How can you do this as his mother?</font>

536
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,956
<font color="yellow">Do you think I lied because I wanted to?</font>

537
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:26,045
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm his mother!
I did it because as his mother,</font>

538
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:29,452
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make him
walk on a path of flowers!</font>

539
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:30,477
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

540
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:33,929
<font color="yellow">How can you be so immature?</font>

541
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:37,187
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing as a path of flowers!</font>

542
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:41,194
<font color="yellow">I dare you to plant as
many flowers as you can.</font>

543
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:43,327
<font color="yellow">Do you think it'll turn
into a path of flowers?</font>

544
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:49,366
<font color="yellow">You have to walk in thorns and
weeds before you get to walk in flowers!</font>

545
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:52,842
<font color="yellow">I don't want my son
to walk in a path of thorns!</font>

546
00:41:53,476 --> 00:42:00,062
<font color="yellow">I don't want my son to suffer
and die just like his father did!</font>

547
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,937
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep bringing up my dead son?</font>

548
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:08,374
<font color="yellow">My son lived a nice life!</font>

549
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,851
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep blaming my son, huh?</font>

550
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:15,132
<font color="yellow">My son lived the best that he could!</font>

551
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:20,687
<font color="yellow">That's why we have
this house for us to live in!</font>

552
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:24,841
<font color="yellow">Who are you to disrespect my son?</font>

553
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:29,577
<font color="yellow">- My son had a good life!
- Mom, what's wrong with you?</font>

554
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,905
<font color="yellow">She keeps blaming my son!</font>

555
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:40,698
<font color="yellow">When did I say that? Fine! It's all
my fault! I'm the one who deserves to die!</font>

556
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:43,101
<font color="yellow">Yes, you are!</font>

557
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:47,301
<font color="yellow">Goodness! You don't even
deserve to be a mother!</font>

558
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:51,321
<font color="yellow">You drove a nail into your child's heart,
so of course you don't deserve</font>

559
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:54,086
<font color="yellow">to be a mother! You have
no right to be a mother!</font>

560
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,319
<font color="yellow">You better not try to interfere
with Jang-go's life again!</font>

561
00:42:57,687 --> 00:43:03,702
<font color="yellow">If you do, we'll both fight until we die!</font>

562
00:43:03,727 --> 00:43:05,874
<font color="yellow">- Mom, stop it!
- Got it?</font>

563
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:06,899
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

564
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:10,898
<font color="yellow">Oh, Jang-soo. Jang-soo.</font>

565
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:57,586
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

566
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:04,617
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

567
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:14,469
<font color="yellow"><i>If I can't take you out,</i></font>

568
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:19,908
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll have to love you</i></font>

569
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:28,683
<font color="yellow"><i>Just like this, stay this way</i></font>

570
00:44:29,453 --> 00:44:30,453
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

571
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:40,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Stay this way</i></font>

572
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,269
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Mi-poong.</font>

573
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:05,742
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

574
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:07,539
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

575
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,711
<font color="yellow">You're really going to marry her?</font>

576
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:14,711
<font color="yellow">Think about this carefully.
Aren't you rushing?</font>

577
00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:17,530
<font color="yellow">Aunt, I already thought about it carefully.</font>

578
00:45:18,078 --> 00:45:19,078
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go.</font>

579
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:21,507
<font color="yellow">Is marriage a joke?</font>

580
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:25,679
<font color="yellow">You quit the law firm.
With what money will you marry her?</font>

581
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:28,523
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's say you'll have a simple wedding.</font>

582
00:45:28,874 --> 00:45:30,069
<font color="yellow">Where will you live?</font>

583
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,452
<font color="yellow">You keep your mouth shut.</font>

584
00:45:32,828 --> 00:45:35,205
<font color="yellow">The eldest son in our family
is going to get married.</font>

585
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:37,638
<font color="yellow">What right do you have
to say anything about it?</font>

586
00:45:39,422 --> 00:45:43,555
<font color="yellow">Since you seem uncomfortable
with her, mother, we'll move out.</font>

587
00:45:44,562 --> 00:45:48,663
<font color="yellow">And I can't make her throw
her mother and Yoo-sung away.</font>

588
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,711
<font color="yellow">That's why we're going
to live with her family.</font>

589
00:45:53,108 --> 00:45:54,787
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, you're so-</font>

590
00:45:55,187 --> 00:46:01,306
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, unless you're going to
help him pay for a house, shut your trap.</font>

591
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:06,937
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

592
00:46:12,734 --> 00:46:17,343
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you're the eldest son of our family.</font>

593
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:24,812
<font color="yellow">If you move out of this house with Mi-poong
just because we're uncomfortable with her,</font>

594
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,349
<font color="yellow">there will be no chance for us to get closer,</font>

595
00:46:28,373 --> 00:46:30,497
<font color="yellow">and we'll just become strangers in the end.</font>

596
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:31,796
<font color="yellow">That's wrong.</font>

597
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,343
<font color="yellow">Grandma, but...</font>

598
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:39,006
<font color="yellow">If you decided to marry Mi-poong
and make a family with her,</font>

599
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:43,671
<font color="yellow">then you have to make an effort for
all of us to become one family.</font>

600
00:46:43,696 --> 00:46:47,819
<font color="yellow">So just stay here until we become
closer and then move out.</font>

601
00:46:48,062 --> 00:46:51,179
<font color="yellow">That way, we'll really become a family.</font>

602
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:57,608
<font color="yellow">But if all of us live here together,
the population density will increase.</font>

603
00:46:57,633 --> 00:47:01,887
<font color="yellow">- It's already so difficult to use the bathroom, so...
- Hee-ra!</font>

604
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:04,101
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

605
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:07,354
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I think grandma is right.</font>

606
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:10,293
<font color="yellow">- We need to live together to get closer.
- That's right.</font>

607
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,546
<font color="yellow">Let's do that.</font>

608
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:18,785
<font color="yellow">We'll let Mi-poong's mother and
Yoo-sung continue to live in the back house.</font>

609
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:21,597
<font color="yellow">Let's do that, Jang-go.</font>

610
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,392
<font color="yellow">Let the kids get married.</font>

611
00:47:28,547 --> 00:47:29,757
<font color="yellow">Ma'am...</font>

612
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:40,268
<font color="yellow">Our family has already
decided to let them get married.</font>

613
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:47,773
<font color="yellow">Let's forget all the horrible feelings
and comfortably get them married.</font>

614
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:50,609
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

615
00:47:51,758 --> 00:47:54,950
<font color="yellow">I'm very grateful for
your words, but we need to</font>

616
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:58,257
<font color="yellow">move out, so we don't
have any money for a wedding-</font>

617
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:01,366
<font color="yellow">We don't have any money either.</font>

618
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:05,071
<font color="yellow">Let's just think of it
as combining two families.</font>

619
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:10,171
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong will be moving into
Jang-go's room. Just think comfortably.</font>

620
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:12,280
<font color="yellow">Goodness. But still...</font>

621
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,814
<font color="yellow">I didn't bring much with me
when I got married either,</font>

622
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:20,164
<font color="yellow">but I'm still living pretty well to this day.</font>

623
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,602
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am...
- It's all mind over matter.</font>

624
00:48:25,627 --> 00:48:31,904
<font color="yellow">If you think it won't work, it won't,
but if you think it'll work, it'll work.</font>

625
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,155
<font color="yellow">And you don't have to move out.</font>

626
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:39,753
<font color="yellow">Jang-go wanted to move out, but I stopped him.</font>

627
00:48:40,343 --> 00:48:47,155
<font color="yellow">If you move away, we won't be able to see
each other, and we'll become strangers then.</font>

628
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:53,179
<font color="yellow">We'll become a real family
once we live together.</font>

629
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:56,710
<font color="yellow">Just think comfortably.</font>

630
00:48:57,108 --> 00:49:03,929
<font color="yellow">How will Mi-poong be able to live
after sending you and Yoo-sung away?</font>

631
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:09,077
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, this isn't right.</font>

632
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:14,250
<font color="yellow">We already signed the contract to move
into our new house by the end of the month.</font>

633
00:49:14,593 --> 00:49:15,593
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo.</font>

634
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:17,243
<font color="yellow">Do as grandma says.</font>

635
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:22,561
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong and I won't be able to live comfortably
if you and Yoo-sung leave like this.</font>

636
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:31,515
<font color="yellow">Don't trouble yourself and
let's just do it this way. All right?</font>

637
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:57,737
<font color="yellow">Jang-go said he was going to move out
with Mi-poong, but I told them to stay here.</font>

638
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:01,885
<font color="yellow">Think about it in their shoes. It would be</font>

639
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,654
<font color="yellow">heartbreaking and lonely for Mi-poong to leave</font>

640
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:07,535
<font color="yellow">her mother and nephew
when they came from North Korea</font>

641
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,313
<font color="yellow">and have no other family member here.</font>

642
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:12,711
<font color="yellow">That's why I told them to just live here.</font>

643
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:20,219
<font color="yellow">I'm talking to you,
but how can you just lie there</font>

644
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:23,688
<font color="yellow">like that? Where did you learn your manners?</font>

645
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:27,750
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Your daughters-in-law
will learn great things from you!</font>

646
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:41,297
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you're going to
get married to that lawyer?</font>

647
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:42,672
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

648
00:50:43,813 --> 00:50:44,880
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

649
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:47,552
<font color="yellow">We were actually worried about you.</font>

650
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,123
<font color="yellow">But how could that female lawyer
do such a thing? She's terrible!</font>

651
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:57,766
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, tell us what you need.
We'll get it for you as a wedding present.</font>

652
00:50:57,791 --> 00:51:01,455
<font color="yellow">Really? Thank you so much!</font>

653
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:14,656
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I heard you're getting
married to Jang-go.</font>

654
00:51:16,477 --> 00:51:17,477
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

655
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:20,917
<font color="yellow">I sincerely congratulate you.</font>

656
00:51:21,976 --> 00:51:24,578
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll be happy with Jang-go.</font>

657
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:27,071
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

658
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,070
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

659
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:39,336
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it now,
I never apologized to you.</font>

660
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:44,493
<font color="yellow">All this time, I bothered you, gave you a hard</font>

661
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:48,641
<font color="yellow">time, and annoyed you
just because I liked you.</font>

662
00:51:50,258 --> 00:51:51,258
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

663
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:56,547
<font color="yellow">Next time, I'm going to
the headquarters in America.</font>

664
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:58,159
<font color="yellow">Headquarters in America?</font>

665
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:00,026
<font color="yellow">It's not because of you.</font>

666
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:03,887
<font color="yellow">I just want to go somewhere else
and get more experience.</font>

667
00:52:05,094 --> 00:52:07,836
<font color="yellow">That's why I don't think
I'll be able to go to your wedding.</font>

668
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,844
<font color="yellow">Have a safe trip.</font>

669
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:13,898
<font color="yellow">Thanks. Be happy.</font>

670
00:52:14,743 --> 00:52:17,398
<font color="yellow">If Jang-go doesn't listen to you,
call me anytime.</font>

671
00:52:18,524 --> 00:52:19,992
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mr. Bang.</font>

672
00:52:21,454 --> 00:52:24,469
<font color="yellow">Shall we say our good-byes?</font>

673
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:49,398
<font color="yellow">- Nothing unusual happened?
- No.</font>

674
00:52:50,422 --> 00:52:51,688
<font color="yellow">But Mr. Kim...</font>

675
00:52:52,571 --> 00:52:53,571
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

676
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,758
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to come out next weekend.</font>

677
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,780
<font color="yellow">There are many customers
on the weekends. It'll be busy.</font>

678
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:04,205
<font color="yellow">I know that, but it's my nephew's wedding.
My sister-in-law's son.</font>

679
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:06,625
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil's son is getting married?</font>

680
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:09,332
<font color="yellow">Young Geum-sil had such an old son?</font>

681
00:53:10,352 --> 00:53:14,484
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, why are you calling
my sister-in-law "Geum-sil?"</font>

682
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:18,415
<font color="yellow">Be careful what you say. And Geum-sil is old!</font>

683
00:53:19,118 --> 00:53:20,118
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

684
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:24,086
<font color="yellow">I thought the two of you were
just a couple years apart.</font>

685
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:25,594
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

686
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:29,963
<font color="yellow">And I called her that because she seemed
friendly and sweet like my older sister.</font>

687
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,508
<font color="yellow">If it offends you,
I won't call her that anymore.</font>

688
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:36,495
<font color="yellow">Lock up the doors well before you go home.</font>

689
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:43,321
<font color="yellow">How annoying! That jerk!</font>

690
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:47,860
<font color="yellow">How bad is his vision? He wears glasses, too!</font>

691
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:51,372
<font color="yellow">What? Geum-sil and
I only look a couple years apart?</font>

692
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,532
<font color="yellow">Darn it! How annoying!</font>

693
00:54:03,078 --> 00:54:06,438
<font color="yellow">Yoo-Jin, let's eat ribs until we explode!</font>

694
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,079
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

695
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:10,981
<font color="yellow">Can we really eat until we explode?</font>

696
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:13,571
<font color="yellow">Of course! Excuse me!</font>

697
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:17,413
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

698
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:19,550
<font color="yellow">Please give us four servings of pork ribs-</font>

699
00:54:20,563 --> 00:54:23,399
<font color="yellow">I mean four servings of cow ribs.</font>

700
00:54:26,477 --> 00:54:27,993
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

701
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:30,500
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Kim Soon-boon?</font>

702
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:36,643
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Young-ae?</font>

703
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:40,133
<font color="yellow">Soon-boon!</font>

704
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:42,813
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Young-ae!</font>

705
00:54:55,352 --> 00:54:58,514
<font color="yellow">So, Dae-hoon and Yeong-cheol
died while you were escaping,</font>

706
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:01,443
<font color="yellow">and only you and Seung-hee survived?</font>

707
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:11,032
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae said that Young-ae's family died.
Does she really think they're dead?</font>

708
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:17,235
<font color="yellow">Or does she know they're alive and
is still pretending to be Seung-hee?</font>

709
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:20,246
<font color="yellow">Do you have a place to stay?</font>

710
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:24,169
<font color="yellow">I'm staying at a motel right now.</font>

711
00:55:24,493 --> 00:55:30,438
<font color="yellow">Young-ae, I'll pay you,
so can I stay here for a few days?</font>

712
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:35,108
<font color="yellow">You don't have to pay. While you're
in Korea, you can stay here.</font>

713
00:55:35,813 --> 00:55:36,946
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Young-ae.</font>

714
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:45,336
<font color="yellow">I have an important phone call.</font>

715
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,841
<font color="yellow">What kind of phone call is it?</font>

716
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:56,344
<font color="yellow">I told you I would pay you back. I can
pay you back by the end of this month.</font>

717
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,211
<font color="yellow">I told you I would pay you back!
Why can't you believe me?</font>

718
00:56:01,306 --> 00:56:04,578
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want! Come here
and take my liver or kidneys if you want!</font>

719
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:10,938
<font color="yellow">- Who...?
- Oh...</font>

720
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:12,763
<font color="yellow">Are you Seung-hee?</font>

721
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:14,798
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

722
00:56:15,102 --> 00:56:17,750
<font color="yellow">Me? I'm your mom's friend.</font>

723
00:56:18,735 --> 00:56:21,539
<font color="yellow">Hello. Why aren't you coming inside?</font>

724
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:24,336
<font color="yellow">- Go in first.
- All right.</font>

725
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:33,313
<font color="yellow">So Shin-ae stole Seung-hee's spot, huh?</font>

726
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:36,412
<font color="yellow">She's that old man's real granddaughter.</font>

727
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:38,318
<font color="yellow">Should I tell her or not?</font>

728
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:40,365
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

729
00:56:40,928 --> 00:56:44,097
<font color="yellow">If I just keep my mouth shut,
I'll be able to keep getting money.</font>

730
00:56:57,396 --> 00:56:58,789
<font color="yellow">The weather is great.</font>

731
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:06,240
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I'm getting married
to a little tadpole like you.</font>

732
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,349
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it either.</font>

733
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:13,864
<font color="yellow">The hideous fish boy is becoming my husband.</font>

734
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,716
<font color="yellow">What? Hideous?</font>

735
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:20,826
<font color="yellow">But if we get married,
do we have to call each other</font>

736
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:24,429
<font color="yellow">"honey" and "sweetheart"
like other married couples?</font>

737
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,350
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

738
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,013
<font color="yellow">I think that will be too cheesy for me!</font>

739
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:31,038
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

740
00:57:32,498 --> 00:57:34,005
<font color="yellow">What's so hard about that?</font>

741
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,170
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

742
00:57:38,506 --> 00:57:41,928
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, don't do that! I feel like
I ate 100 spoonfuls of butter!</font>

743
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:43,896
<font color="yellow">How could you say that, honey?</font>

744
00:57:43,921 --> 00:57:46,302
<font color="yellow">- Please don't say that!
- Honey!</font>

745
00:57:46,498 --> 00:57:47,732
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong!</font>

746
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:50,997
<font color="yellow">How can you fall down like a little kid?</font>

747
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:52,366
<font color="yellow">Honey, are you okay?</font>

748
00:57:53,857 --> 00:57:58,480
<font color="yellow">- Stop that!
- Honey, are you okay?
Do you need to go to the hospital, honey?</font>

749
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:17,599
<font color="yellow">Wow! You're so beautiful!</font>

750
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,928
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Mi-poong!</font>

751
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:22,186
<font color="yellow">You look so beautiful!</font>

752
00:58:42,506 --> 00:58:45,162
<font color="yellow">Hello, girls!</font>

753
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,279
<font color="yellow">Hi, Chung-ja! Nice to see you again!</font>

754
00:58:48,419 --> 00:58:50,232
<font color="yellow">These are my friends. Say hello.</font>

755
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:51,436
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

756
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:54,865
<font color="yellow">Your daughter-in-law looks better than before.</font>

757
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:58,275
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't give her
a hard time nowadays.</font>

758
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,300
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

759
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:01,575
<font color="yellow">When did I give her a hard time?</font>

760
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,964
<font color="yellow">- Let's go to Geum-sil.
- All right.</font>

761
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:12,341
<font color="yellow">What's going on?
Why is Ms. Joo standing there?</font>

762
00:59:14,522 --> 00:59:17,855
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong is the bride
who's getting married today?</font>

763
00:59:19,475 --> 00:59:22,093
<font color="yellow">She's going to be Hee-ra's sister-in-law?</font>

764
00:59:23,576 --> 00:59:24,793
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Shin-ae?</font>

765
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:28,392
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I'm going to use the restroom.</font>

766
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,482
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

767
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:34,677
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
- Congratulations.</font>

768
00:59:34,702 --> 00:59:35,702
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

769
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:38,334
<font color="yellow">Say hi. This is my son.</font>

770
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:40,722
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

771
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,147
<font color="yellow">Yes. Congratulations.</font>

772
00:59:42,982 --> 00:59:45,452
<font color="yellow">- Where's Shin-ae?
- She went to the restroom.</font>

773
00:59:46,842 --> 00:59:51,361
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, brighten up. Why do you
look so unhappy on such a joyful day?</font>

774
00:59:52,982 --> 00:59:55,110
<font color="yellow">Is it because you can't get
a lawyer daughter-in-law?</font>

775
00:59:58,209 --> 00:59:59,693
<font color="yellow">Yeah, brighten up.</font>

776
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:03,838
<font color="yellow">Don't think of it as losing your son.
Think of it as gaining a daughter.</font>

777
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:09,560
<font color="yellow">But your in-law is so pretty like a flower.</font>

778
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:14,794
<font color="yellow">I know. It makes you get compared to her.</font>

779
01:00:22,677 --> 01:00:26,747
<font color="yellow">What the heck? It's that gold digger
who used to work at our restaurant!</font>

780
01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:32,392
<font color="yellow">Then what's going on? Our daughters
are going to be sisters-in-law?</font>

781
01:00:32,912 --> 01:00:34,400
<font color="yellow">Oh my god! No way!</font>

782
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:36,186
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, let's go inside.</font>

783
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:40,013
<font color="yellow">You guys go ahead.</font>

784
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:42,695
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use the restroom first.</font>

785
01:00:43,193 --> 01:00:46,587
<font color="yellow">- Let's go inside.
- This way.</font>

786
01:00:47,889 --> 01:00:52,689
<font color="yellow">How cheap! I can't believe our daughters
are going to be sisters-in-law!</font>

787
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:56,576
<font color="yellow">How the heck did Geum-sil
get such a daughter-in-law?</font>

788
01:01:04,779 --> 01:01:09,412
<font color="yellow">Mom, Mi-poong looks like
an angel who fell from the sky.</font>

789
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:11,560
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

790
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:18,214
<font color="yellow">Yes. Since you're marrying a lawyer, you'll live
well even if you don't find your grandfather.</font>

791
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:24,543
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae has to be that old man's
granddaughter so that Yoo-Jin and I can live.</font>

792
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:27,539
<font color="yellow">(Bride: Kim Mi-poong)</font>

793
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:33,361
<font color="yellow">Yoo-Jin, let's take a picture!</font>

794
01:01:33,386 --> 01:01:35,533
<font color="yellow">- Yay!
- Yay!</font>

795
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,861
<font color="yellow">Please take a pretty photo!</font>

796
01:01:48,768 --> 01:01:52,306
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Why is that woman here?</font>

797
01:01:53,385 --> 01:01:55,142
<font color="yellow">Is she out of her mind?</font>

798
01:01:58,705 --> 01:02:01,505
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's pretty busy at the wedding hall-</font>

799
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,257
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

800
01:02:03,281 --> 01:02:07,267
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? What are you doing?
- Come with me!</font>

801
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:16,845
<font color="yellow">It's that woman from last time!</font>

802
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:19,174
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

803
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:25,116
<font color="yellow">Be gentle! Why are you so strong?</font>

804
01:02:25,305 --> 01:02:29,189
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? What did you tell Mi-poong?</font>

805
01:02:29,877 --> 01:02:32,803
<font color="yellow">Are you scared I told her that
you're acting as the fake granddaughter?</font>

806
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:35,217
<font color="yellow">You must be scared after all.</font>

807
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:37,892
<font color="yellow">You knew Kim Seung-hee was alive, huh?</font>

808
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,619
<font color="yellow">You'll be damned to hell!</font>

809
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:44,752
<font color="yellow">If you do this, you won't even get one penny!</font>

810
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:50,713
<font color="yellow">What? Fake?</font>

811
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,033
<font color="yellow">Fake granddaughter?</font>

812
01:03:15,701 --> 01:03:17,213
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

813
01:03:17,238 --> 01:03:20,409
<font color="yellow">You two just have to live happily.</font>

814
01:03:20,783 --> 01:03:22,166
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- Mother!</font>

815
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:24,729
<font color="yellow">Are you making her make
breakfast all by herself?</font>

816
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:27,534
<font color="yellow">- Please do the dishes for me.
- How dare she order me around!</font>

817
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:30,092
<font color="yellow">Pretend this marriage never happened then!</font>

818
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:31,619
<font color="yellow">You con-artist! You thief!</font>

819
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:34,088
<font color="yellow">It's all over when I tell him
you're an imposter!</font>

820
01:03:34,113 --> 01:03:35,869
<font color="yellow">It'll be the end for you, too!</font>

821
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:38,705
<font color="yellow">You need to give me money
for me to live in China.</font>

822
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,682
<font color="yellow">This is the only method we have, mother!</font>

823
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:43,705
<font color="yellow">- How about we have a baby?
- A baby?</font>

824
01:03:43,731 --> 01:03:45,565
<font color="yellow">- I'll come get you.
- Mom!</font>

825
