00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:08,312
<font color=#FFFF00>If you die,</font>

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,026
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to die as well.</font>

4
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,391
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

5
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

6
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:35,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, can you see me?</font>

7
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:39,070
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dae-hoon.
- I'm Dae-hoon.</font>

8
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,922
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

9
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:46,546
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

10
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,265
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

11
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:57,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Father! Father! Father! Father!</font>

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor! Doctor!</font>

13
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:12,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- (Episode 49)
- Congratulations on becoming
the president of Winner's Group.</font>

14
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:17,031
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, but I'm only the
acting president right now.</font>

15
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,658
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true,</font>

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,117
<font color=#FFFF00>but you still got up there.</font>

17
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,101
<font color=#FFFF00>And you know who you should thank for that?</font>

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. I know it's all
thanks to you, mother.</font>

19
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:38,133
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I'm fishing for compliments,
but I'm grateful you know that.</font>

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,609
<font color=#FFFF00>So from now on, as you much as you've
done wrong, be good to Hee-dong.</font>

21
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,250
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all I want.</font>

22
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:52,973
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, mother. I'll always be good to
Hee-dong and live as a good wife to him.</font>

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Later on, you shouldn't
coax my innocent son into</font>

24
00:01:57,226 --> 00:02:00,695
<font color=#FFFF00>adopting Yoo-Jin as his child.
That can never happen.</font>

25
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,007
<font color=#FFFF00>You better keep that promise.</font>

26
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,461
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. Don't worry.</font>

27
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:11,425
<font color=#FFFF00>But mother, what will we do
if Hee-dong keeps refusing</font>

28
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,497
<font color=#FFFF00>to come home and insists
on getting a divorce?</font>

29
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:18,578
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be awfully upset to do that.</font>

30
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about it in his shoes.</font>

31
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:26,679
<font color=#FFFF00>What if Hee-dong had a hidden child? Wouldn't
you feel like your world fell apart?</font>

32
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,366
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

33
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:36,017
<font color=#FFFF00>If, like you said, your feelings for him are
sincere, then he'll come back later on.</font>

34
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell him you can never get a divorce.</font>

35
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:43,816
<font color=#FFFF00>Please meet Hee-dong and convince him.</font>

36
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:45,999
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

37
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:50,546
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, mother. Please eat a lot.</font>

38
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:56,326
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim is still lying there unconscious.
Now he just needs to pass away.</font>

39
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:00,388
<font color=#FFFF00>After we send that fool to a
hospital somewhere far in</font>

40
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,295
<font color=#FFFF00>the countryside in America,
won't it be our world now?</font>

41
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,749
<font color=#FFFF00>The steak tastes very delicious today.</font>

42
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,425
<font color=#FFFF00>- Eat some more.
- Go ahead and eat.</font>

43
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:18,726
<font color=#FFFF00>You're getting a call.</font>

44
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,366
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he calling me?</font>

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, dad.</font>

46
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,570
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

47
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather woke up?</font>

48
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,281
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

49
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:42,468
<font color=#FFFF00>He's still unconscious.</font>

50
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:46,554
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that he woke up?</font>

51
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:51,484
<font color=#FFFF00>If he really had woken up earlier, then the
chances of him recovering are very high.</font>

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,133
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a good sign.</font>

53
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55,163
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's wait and see.</font>

54
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:57,747
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.</font>

55
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:58,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

56
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

57
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,424
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true Mr. Kim woke up?
Did you make a mistake?</font>

58
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,385
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

59
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,497
<font color=#FFFF00>N-No. I didn't make a mistake.</font>

60
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,932
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the truth!</font>

61
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,500
<font color=#FFFF00>My father really had woken up.</font>

62
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,424
<font color=#FFFF00>He even called my name.</font>

63
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,073
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Don't lie. If he had woken
up, why would he be like this?</font>

64
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:24,377
<font color=#FFFF00>Look! He's the same as ever!</font>

65
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:28,408
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of you, we had
to run over here without</font>

66
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,323
<font color=#FFFF00>eating the expensive steak we had ordered!</font>

67
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:36,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this? My goodness! How annoying!
How could you be so annoying?</font>

68
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,873
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's the truth!</font>

69
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:41,269
<font color=#FFFF00>He really had woken up! I'm serious!</font>

70
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,407
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you yell at me.</font>

71
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,263
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dae-hoon.
- Dal-ho! Hee-dong!</font>

72
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,410
<font color=#FFFF00>You said Mr. Kim had woken up.
What happened?</font>

73
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,394
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

74
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,065
<font color=#FFFF00>It's no use. He's the same as ever.</font>

75
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:58,823
<font color=#FFFF00>The doctor came by a while ago, and
he said Mr. Kim is still unconscious.</font>

76
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,174
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

77
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,838
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what he said, father.</font>

78
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, what did you mean
when you said Mr. Kim had woken up?</font>

79
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:11,336
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is, he really had woken up.</font>

80
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:15,213
<font color=#FFFF00>He woke up and said my name, too.</font>

81
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Whenever you speak, it's a lie.</font>

82
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:21,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Just look at him! He's like
the boy who cried wolf!</font>

83
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:25,284
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand that
he wants Mr. Kim to wake up,</font>

84
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,425
<font color=#FFFF00>but he made all of us come
here when we were busy.</font>

85
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:30,675
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

86
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,971
<font color=#FFFF00>He really had woken up.</font>

87
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:38,487
<font color=#FFFF00>He really woke up and said my name.</font>

88
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You have so many tears.</font>

89
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:44,713
<font color=#FFFF00>You always cry. Do you think
crying will solve everything?</font>

90
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:46,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet!</font>

91
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,187
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to stay here
because I had an errand</font>

92
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:52,675
<font color=#FFFF00>to do. But you let Dae-hoon
here all by himself?</font>

93
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:56,715
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I was only gone for a moment.</font>

94
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:01,237
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling the truth, Dal-ho!
I'm telling the truth, Hee-dong!</font>

95
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,620
<font color=#FFFF00>If that's what you say
is true, then it's true.</font>

96
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:06,424
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. Grandfather will wake up soon.</font>

97
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,847
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

98
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,806
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, we need to talk.</font>

99
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:28,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, I won't ask you to forgive me.</font>

100
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,284
<font color=#FFFF00>But after grandfather
collapsed, your father and my</font>

101
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,753
<font color=#FFFF00>dad have been sleeping at
the hospital every day.</font>

102
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,813
<font color=#FFFF00>The house is empty and scary.</font>

103
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:43,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides getting a divorce, I'll
do anything you want me to do.</font>

104
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:48,534
<font color=#FFFF00>So can't you come home now?</font>

105
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,471
<font color=#FFFF00>If you hate me, do it
for your mother's sake.</font>

106
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:57,956
<font color=#FFFF00>Or...</font>

107
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,426
<font color=#FFFF00>for Yoo-jin's sake.</font>

108
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

109
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:12,018
<font color=#FFFF00>You can call me shameless, and
I can't argue against that.</font>

110
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,588
<font color=#FFFF00>But you brought Yoo-Jin.</font>

111
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,219
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want you to
ever find out about her,</font>

112
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,652
<font color=#FFFF00>but you were the one who brought her home!</font>

113
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:27,131
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to talk about this with you.</font>

114
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:32,346
<font color=#FFFF00>Like I said last time, we'll talk about
this after grandfather wakes up.</font>

115
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,745
<font color=#FFFF00>And what if my grandfather wakes up?</font>

116
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:40,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Will we get a divorce then?</font>

117
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:48,410
<font color=#FFFF00>When my grandfather wakes up, we're going
to present him with our divorce as a gift?</font>

118
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:57,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

119
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,256
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

120
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,306
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin left me a letter and disappeared?</font>

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo...</font>

122
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,784
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin disappeared?</font>

123
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:18,164
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

124
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,885
<font color=#FFFF00>To Mr. Jo Hee-dong.</font>

125
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:26,463
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to return to the orphanage.</font>

126
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:30,979
<font color=#FFFF00>So please live a happy life with my mom.</font>

127
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,424
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my wish.</font>

128
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,175
<font color=#FFFF00>From, Yoo-Jin.</font>

129
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no!</font>

130
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,683
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no...</font>

131
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:48,651
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stay home, please. Yoo-Jin might come back.
- All right.</font>

132
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, kid. Are you going somewhere?</font>

133
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you alone?</font>

134
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin!</font>

135
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:29,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Shin-ae.</font>

136
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:30,933
<font color=#FFFF00>You got a call?</font>

137
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:32,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she?</font>

138
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,435
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm closer, so I'll head over there first.</font>

139
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

140
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin!</font>

141
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo!</font>

142
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,363
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you go?</font>

143
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

144
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:58,505
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad I met her.</font>

145
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,729
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. Thank you.
- Bye, kid.</font>

146
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,362
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin, why did you do that?</font>

147
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how worried I was about you?</font>

148
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:17,838
<font color=#FFFF00>You and mom will live happily if I'm gone.</font>

149
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,183
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin.</font>

150
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Take me to the orphanage.</font>

151
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:25,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

152
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin, I told you.
It's not because of you.</font>

153
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:35,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Then can't you live happily with my mom?</font>

154
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:43,196
<font color=#FFFF00>I really want you and my mom
to live happily together.</font>

155
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:50,634
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

156
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back home,</font>

157
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:57,179
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't ever run away from home again.</font>

158
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

159
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:00,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

160
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:02,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, really.</font>

161
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

162
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,535
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll never do this again.</font>

163
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,821
<font color=#FFFF00>Promise me, too.</font>

164
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,384
<font color=#FFFF00>(Motel)</font>

165
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:51,133
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, this is the cheapest place.
It's fifteen dollars per night.</font>

166
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,977
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's very shabby.</font>

167
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:59,203
<font color=#FFFF00>That's fine. We just need a place to stay.
Let's go inside.</font>

168
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,009
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

169
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:27,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, are we living here now?</font>

170
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:32,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we'll be staying
here for the time being.</font>

171
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:36,352
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't like this place.
There's no bathroom.</font>

172
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:40,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course there's a bathroom.
It's right outside.</font>

173
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,264
<font color=#FFFF00>That bathroom is stinky and scary.</font>

174
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,383
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go with you.</font>

175
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,729
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a good boy, aren't you?</font>

176
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I pack Yoo-sung's cold medicine?</font>

177
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, can you and Yoo-sung
stay here by yourselves?</font>

178
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,516
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Where are you going?</font>

179
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,008
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to look for work.</font>

180
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,925
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to pay for the bank debt,
private loan, and living expenses.</font>

181
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,086
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to start work as soon as possible.</font>

182
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:18,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, I'm sorry.</font>

183
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,125
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all because I'm
incompetent and foolish.</font>

184
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:26,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you say that?
You're making me upset.</font>

185
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have agreed
to go on home shopping.</font>

186
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:34,914
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought we would be able to
find your father that way.</font>

187
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:39,321
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What on earth is going on?</font>

188
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:46,774
<font color=#FFFF00>We lost our security deposit, and
our successful diner went bankrupt.</font>

189
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:51,969
<font color=#FFFF00>How will we be able to pay
back that enormous debt?</font>

190
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:55,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, we can start over again.</font>

191
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,001
<font color=#FFFF00>If we gather our strength
and work hard, we'll be</font>

192
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,493
<font color=#FFFF00>reunited with father, and
a good day will come.</font>

193
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,750
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll work hard, so cheer up. Okay?</font>

194
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:09,977
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

195
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:13,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. We need to gather
strength and start over again.</font>

196
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,943
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to find your father, too.</font>

197
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:20,531
<font color=#FFFF00>I should search for a job in the area.</font>

198
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:24,191
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you lock the door.
I'll be back soon.</font>

199
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:26,087
<font color=#FFFF00>Be safe.</font>

200
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,844
<font color=#FFFF00>- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

201
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:50,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, don't cry. I don't need a bathroom.</font>

202
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

203
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong.</font>

204
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,101
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

205
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go...</font>

206
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:34,170
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The season silently leaves</i></font>

207
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:35,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go...
<i>The season silently leaves</i></font>

208
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,848
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The season silently leaves</i></font>

209
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:46,189
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'm silently crying</i></font>

210
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:52,762
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I miss you, I miss you so much</i></font>

211
00:16:52,762 --> 00:17:03,072
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The one person who crashes into the empty air</i></font>

212
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,726
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come again. Oh, hi, mom.</font>

213
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:10,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi. Oh my goodness.</font>

214
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:13,531
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have had a lot
of customers today, too.</font>

215
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:18,742
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. Oh my gosh.
Let's lie down here and rest.
- Sure.</font>

216
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:27,883
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my goodness.
- Goodness.</font>

217
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:33,530
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

218
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Jang-go?</font>

219
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:39,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he eat?</font>

220
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. It's freezing outside, but he's
not even coming home. Is he dead or alive?</font>

221
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:47,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, why would you talk like that?</font>

222
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,180
<font color=#FFFF00>He won't die just because he got a divorce.</font>

223
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:52,225
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all my fault.</font>

224
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:56,413
<font color=#FFFF00>If I hadn't written a guarantee, then
they wouldn't have gotten a divorce.</font>

225
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, mom. That's not true.</font>

226
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:03,979
<font color=#FFFF00>You were trying your best to get them
back together and to help Mi-poong out.</font>

227
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:08,711
<font color=#FFFF00>They got a divorce because they were meant
to get a divorce, so don't feel that way.</font>

228
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:11,544
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder how Mi-poong is doing.</font>

229
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't even meet up with her.</font>

230
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,702
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll live somehow, so forget about her.</font>

231
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:22,563
<font color=#FFFF00>But mom, I had a strange dream.</font>

232
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:24,227
<font color=#FFFF00>What? About Jang-go?</font>

233
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:29,008
<font color=#FFFF00>No. Remember I had a dream about that
phoenix who came into our house?</font>

234
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:35,170
<font color=#FFFF00>In my dream, that phoenix flew
around our house and then left.</font>

235
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,483
<font color=#FFFF00>- The phoenix left our house?
- Yes.</font>

236
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,946
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that I think about it, I had that
dream when Mi-poong moved into our house.</font>

237
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:48,856
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it strange that I had that dream on
the day Jang-go and Mi-poong got a divorce?</font>

238
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:53,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that phoenix meant to be
Mi-poong, and not Hee-Ra?</font>

239
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,043
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. You just had a silly
dream, that's all. My goodness.</font>

240
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:01,313
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess that's true. There's no
way Mi-poong can be the phoenix.</font>

241
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:04,524
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. Nam-yi.</font>

242
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I made a reservation at a
restaurant for tonight.</font>

243
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,785
<font color=#FFFF00>How about we go together and
eat something delicious?</font>

244
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Why out of the blue?</font>

245
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:16,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You two seemed unhappy
because of Geum-sil's oldest</font>

246
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,407
<font color=#FFFF00>son's divorce issue, so I
want to restore your health.</font>

247
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's hurry up and go.</font>

248
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:34,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get all your things?</font>

249
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:38,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't leave your phone
or wallet behind just to</font>

250
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:42,268
<font color=#FFFF00>use that as an excuse
to cling onto Jang-soo.</font>

251
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:45,636
<font color=#FFFF00>I never clung onto him.</font>

252
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. I paid you until today.</font>

253
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:54,966
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me say a word.</font>

254
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:02,106
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't live such a pathetic life
following your ex-boyfriends around.</font>

255
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me say a word, too.</font>

256
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,742
<font color=#FFFF00>You better be good to Jang-soo.</font>

257
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:11,539
<font color=#FFFF00>Or else, I might come back.</font>

258
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,858
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo isn't someone you can
treat so disrespectfully.</font>

259
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,352
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a gem, so treat him right. Got it?</font>

260
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:24,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Who are you to tell me
to treat my husband right?</font>

261
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:27,703
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you, you disrespectful wench!</font>

262
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:36,304
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-Ra! Hee-Ra! Hee-Ra! Move!</font>

263
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:39,203
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do this, Joo-Ri! Hee-Ra, are you okay?</font>

264
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:43,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo...</font>

265
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:55,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Joo-Ri!</font>

266
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:57,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Song Joo-Ri!</font>

267
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,735
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerk! Why did you follow me?</font>

268
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,406
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about me.</font>

269
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-Ra loves me.</font>

270
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,406
<font color=#FFFF00>I love her, too.</font>

271
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:20,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Joo-Ri, I hope you'll live well, too.</font>

272
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:29,625
<font color=#FFFF00>You must live well!</font>

273
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to disobey me again?</font>

274
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:09,586
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, why are you doing this again?</font>

275
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:13,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I or did I not say I would punish
you if you didn't listen to me?</font>

276
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:18,414
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm your father. So why
are you doing this to me?</font>

277
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:25,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim,</font>

278
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:27,673
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

279
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,680
<font color=#FFFF00>did another DNA test on Shin-ae.</font>

280
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:35,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry for doing this
without your permission.</font>

281
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:41,930
<font color=#FFFF00>The result stating that she was your
real granddaughter already came out.</font>

282
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:49,961
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I being suspicious for no reason at all?</font>

283
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:56,276
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like she's not your granddaughter.
I feel like something is wrong. So I...</font>

284
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:58,665
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

285
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,461
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, please wake up now.</font>

286
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:09,977
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake up and please scold
either me or Shin-ae.</font>

287
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

288
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'm Jo Dal-ho.</font>

289
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:26,743
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

290
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,127
<font color=#FFFF00>The test results are out?</font>

291
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,586
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be there right away.</font>

292
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:58,218
<font color=#FFFF00>The test results are out.</font>

293
00:23:58,751 --> 00:23:59,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

294
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,242
<font color=#FFFF00>(Kim Dae-hoon and Park
Shin-ae are not related)</font>

295
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:11,969
<font color=#FFFF00>"Kim Dae-hoon and Park
Shin-ae are not related?"</font>

296
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:24,376
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this be?</font>

297
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what about those results that
confirmed she was the real granddaughter?</font>

298
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did things start to go wrong?</font>

299
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,547
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. She's an imposter.</font>

300
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,914
<font color=#FFFF00>She's Mr. Kim's fake granddaughter.</font>

301
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,235
<font color=#FFFF00>Park Shin-ae.</font>

302
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:41,906
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything was planned from the beginning.</font>

303
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,313
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

304
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:50,196
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, father.</font>

305
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:53,336
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

306
00:24:56,298 --> 00:24:57,758
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, father.</font>

307
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:02,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

308
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:10,875
<font color=#FFFF00>D-Did you just call me?</font>

309
00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:13,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

310
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:21,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Father! Father, you really woke up, right?</font>

311
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,117
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

312
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:28,516
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father.
- My son.</font>

313
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,274
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't close your eyes again, will you?</font>

314
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:37,016
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't fall asleep again, father.</font>

315
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, Dae-hoon.</font>

316
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,491
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hee-dong.
- Yes, father.</font>

317
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:45,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- My father woke up!
- Pardon?</font>

318
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:46,906
<font color=#FFFF00>My father woke up!</font>

319
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:49,086
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, do you recognize me?</font>

320
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:52,672
<font color=#FFFF00>My Hee-dong.</font>

321
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:55,063
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

322
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,406
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, my father opened his eyes!
Look! Look!</font>

323
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:03,047
<font color=#FFFF00>He opened his eyes, didn't he?</font>

324
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:05,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim.</font>

325
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you recognize me?</font>

326
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:09,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal...</font>

327
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho.</font>

328
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:13,266
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim!</font>

329
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:16,477
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes...</font>

330
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,616
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll bring the doctor.</font>

331
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:20,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

332
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:23,618
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom.
- Yes?</font>

333
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,154
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather woke up.</font>

334
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness! Mr. Kim! You woke up?</font>

335
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:29,915
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

336
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

337
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,124
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae.</font>

338
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:51,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae was praying so
much for you to wake up!</font>

339
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:54,531
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, thank you.</font>

340
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:58,336
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for waking up.</font>

341
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,625
<font color=#FFFF00>How can such a miracle happen?</font>

342
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,766
<font color=#FFFF00>They said he was unconscious! What happened?</font>

343
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:15,235
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

344
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Usually, when someone gets a
brain surgery, they can't speak.</font>

345
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,360
<font color=#FFFF00>He speaks clearly, and his mind
is perfectly normal as well.</font>

346
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:23,176
<font color=#FFFF00>How can this happen?</font>

347
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:26,363
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather couldn't have
possibly heard everything</font>

348
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,910
<font color=#FFFF00>you and I said while he was
unconscious, could he?</font>

349
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:30,263
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness.</font>

350
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:32,638
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

351
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:36,341
<font color=#FFFF00>No, no. I checked earlier, and it
didn't seem like that was the case.</font>

352
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:42,145
<font color=#FFFF00>P-Probably not, or else he would've gotten
angry at us as soon as he had woken up.</font>

353
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim's length of life
is so tenaciously long!</font>

354
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he have to wake
up and complicate things?</font>

355
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:51,757
<font color=#FFFF00>If he had just passed away,
we could've sent that fool</font>

356
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:54,506
<font color=#FFFF00>to America, and everything
would've been just fine!</font>

357
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:57,973
<font color=#FFFF00>H-He won't live for much longer now.</font>

358
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm scared
he'll live for a long time?</font>

359
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,833
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just afraid he'll find Mi-poong.</font>

360
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:06,653
<font color=#FFFF00>She's really determined to find her dad.</font>

361
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,795
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, how can you say
something so unlucky?</font>

362
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,521
<font color=#FFFF00>How would they be able
to find him when they're</font>

363
00:28:12,546 --> 00:28:14,309
<font color=#FFFF00>wandering around bankrupt and homeless?</font>

364
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:20,579
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you getting mad at me for?
Did I wish for Mr. Kim wake up?</font>

365
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,777
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, I'm going to go eat.</font>

366
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,191
<font color=#FFFF00>All right,</font>

367
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,949
<font color=#FFFF00>- We'll be back.
- Let's go.</font>

368
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:34,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho.</font>

369
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,246
<font color=#FFFF00>We have a big problem.</font>

370
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:39,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae is...</font>

371
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,407
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know, too?</font>

372
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:44,027
<font color=#FFFF00>That she isn't your granddaughter?</font>

373
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:48,674
<font color=#FFFF00>So, she really isn't?</font>

374
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:05,371
<font color=#FFFF00>She wasn't Dae-hoon's daughter.
She wasn't your granddaughter.</font>

375
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:10,621
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no.</font>

376
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:12,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I had my doubts.</font>

377
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,050
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare she do such a thing.</font>

378
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,339
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to the DNA
test we did last time?</font>

379
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:28,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she hire an employee at the
lab to fabricate the results?</font>

380
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,582
<font color=#FFFF00>- I looked into it, but she didn't.
It's impossible to do so.
- Then?</font>

381
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:37,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she switched her toothbrush with
the toothbrush of your real granddaughter.</font>

382
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:44,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Then doesn't that mean she
knows my real granddaughter?</font>

383
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:48,668
<font color=#FFFF00>She probably does, which is why she knows
so much about the real Kim Seung-hee.</font>

384
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:51,283
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how she got the
ring and the toothbrush.</font>

385
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,213
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes... yes...</font>

386
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,652
<font color=#FFFF00>Now everything is starting to make sense.</font>

387
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:05,105
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't forgive her. I won't let
Park Shin-ae get away with this.</font>

388
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:06,988
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Dal-ho.</font>

389
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:09,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Not now.</font>

390
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:11,466
<font color=#FFFF00>We must chase her out right now!</font>

391
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:16,628
<font color=#FFFF00>We can never do that until we
find my real granddaughter.</font>

392
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:24,894
<font color=#FFFF00>And with such a witch like her, do you think
we can just end with chasing her out?</font>

393
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:30,253
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll have to make sure
she pays for her sins.</font>

394
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:35,188
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a frightening witch
who deceives blood lines.</font>

395
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:38,191
<font color=#FFFF00>If we act rashly,</font>

396
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:43,929
<font color=#FFFF00>my real granddaughter could
get bullied or hurt.</font>

397
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand.</font>

398
00:30:48,152 --> 00:30:49,152
<font color=#FFFF00>But Dal-ho...</font>

399
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:57,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Chung-ja is
involved in this as well.</font>

400
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:00,871
<font color=#FFFF00>My wife?</font>

401
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:05,441
<font color=#FFFF00>The DNA test that was between us...</font>

402
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:13,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Chung-ja knew about it. She also
knew that Shin-ae was an imposter.</font>

403
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:20,566
<font color=#FFFF00>While I was in bed, I heard
Shin-ae and Chung-ja talking.</font>

404
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,175
<font color=#FFFF00>They said they were going to
send Dae-hoon to America.</font>

405
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:28,988
<font color=#FFFF00>They treated him like he
was a mental patient.</font>

406
00:31:29,566 --> 00:31:32,839
<font color=#FFFF00>It makes me shudder.</font>

407
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:36,691
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, is that true?</font>

408
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:38,809
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

409
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:53,347
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, I bought coffee!</font>

410
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:56,566
<font color=#FFFF00>Americano!</font>

411
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you're doing?</font>

412
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:06,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

413
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:08,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you out of your mind?</font>

414
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:11,222
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this to me?</font>

415
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:16,691
<font color=#FFFF00>That man must be crazy! He's crazy!</font>

416
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,246
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Jo Dal-ho!</font>

417
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:25,269
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to make you regret this!</font>

418
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:31,965
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

419
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:37,496
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, we need to talk.</font>

420
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:39,512
<font color=#FFFF00>About what?</font>

421
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,426
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit over there.</font>

422
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,722
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad,</font>

423
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,370
<font color=#FFFF00>did you tell grandfather
about how my mother-in-law</font>

424
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:57,410
<font color=#FFFF00>and I scolded you a bit
when he was unconscious?</font>

425
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,605
<font color=#FFFF00>No, not yet. Why?</font>

426
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,496
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't tell him that.</font>

427
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:05,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

428
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:10,848
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Ms. Ma had mistreated me so much.</font>

429
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:15,269
<font color=#FFFF00>When did we do that? Why are
you saying weird things again?</font>

430
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:19,574
<font color=#FFFF00>When did I mistreat you so much?</font>

431
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:25,373
<font color=#FFFF00>I just scolded you a little bit
because you weren't listening to me.</font>

432
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:29,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, does it make sense for
you to scold your father?</font>

433
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:35,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, dad. I won't do it ever again.</font>

434
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:40,435
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you tell this to
grandpa, he might get</font>

435
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,711
<font color=#FFFF00>upset and faint again
because he got stressed.</font>

436
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:51,707
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, this is candy.</font>

437
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:58,588
<font color=#FFFF00>- Look at the colors! Red, blue, yellow...
- Wow! This is really pretty!</font>

438
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,128
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my gift to you.</font>

439
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, this is my love for you.</font>

440
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,824
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to get along with you.</font>

441
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,363
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, you'll accept my sincerity, won't you?</font>

442
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:11,941
<font color=#FFFF00>It's yummy.</font>

443
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:15,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank goodness he's ten-years-old.</font>

444
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, let's go.</font>

445
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:37,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, dad stayed at
the hospital all this time,</font>

446
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:40,947
<font color=#FFFF00>so I'll take him home tonight,
and he can wash up, too.</font>

447
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:45,298
<font color=#FFFF00>No! I'm not going! I'm going
to stay next to father.</font>

448
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:52,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, you worked hard,
so go home and rest now.</font>

449
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,806
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, grandfather.</font>

450
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:56,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll be going home now.</font>

451
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, Shin-ae must take
me for a ten-year-old fool.</font>

452
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,806
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

453
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae gave me this
candy and told me not to</font>

454
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:24,619
<font color=#FFFF00>tell you about how she
and Ms. Ma mistreated me.</font>

455
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:27,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae is really a terrible daughter.</font>

456
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:29,650
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't seem like my daughter at all.</font>

457
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Poor thing.</font>

458
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Dae-hoon, for
not recognizing her as the</font>

459
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:39,603
<font color=#FFFF00>beast she is and claiming
she was your daughter.</font>

460
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm serious, father!</font>

461
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,736
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae and Ms. Ma hit
me, pinched me, and...</font>

462
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,947
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind.</font>

463
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:53,642
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't get stressed and collapse again.</font>

464
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:57,533
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine. I won't collapse.</font>

465
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:05,298
<font color=#FFFF00>And since I'm awake, no one will
be able to mistreat you anymore.</font>

466
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:08,314
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the strongest man in the world!</font>

467
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:13,267
<font color=#FFFF00>But Dae-hoon...</font>

468
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:15,689
<font color=#FFFF00>from now on...</font>

469
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:22,189
<font color=#FFFF00>don't go anywhere with Shin-ae by yourself.</font>

470
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

471
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:28,111
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to go anywhere
with just Shin-ae either.</font>

472
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Good.</font>

473
00:36:31,142 --> 00:36:33,954
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait until I find my real granddaughter.</font>

474
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:39,001
<font color=#FFFF00>Park Shin-ae, I'll never forgive you.</font>

475
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:49,447
<font color=#FFFF00>So what you want me to do
is follow this Park Shin-ae</font>

476
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:53,968
<font color=#FFFF00>woman here to find out where the
real Kim Seung-hee is, right?</font>

477
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:56,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Please find all the people
who came from North</font>

478
00:36:57,411 --> 00:36:59,766
<font color=#FFFF00>Korea who Park Shin-ae has contacted so far.</font>

479
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:03,439
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim's real granddaughter
should be among them.</font>

480
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Seung-hee's safety is our priority,
so please be as stealthy as possible.</font>

481
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:10,275
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I understand.</font>

482
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:14,103
<font color=#FFFF00>No one can find out about this.</font>

483
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:16,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about security.</font>

484
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:23,003
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do my best and find
the real Kim Seung-hee.</font>

485
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,595
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do.</font>

486
00:37:45,158 --> 00:37:47,376
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

487
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,353
<font color=#FFFF00>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</font>

488
00:37:53,502 --> 00:37:55,595
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give us more radish kimchi.</font>

489
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:57,461
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

490
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:23,673
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, are you all right?</font>

491
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, I try to hold it
in, but I keep coughing.</font>

492
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:33,479
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no, Yoo-sung. Why isn't
your cold going away?</font>

493
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:37,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait just a little bit longer. When
I'm done, we'll go to the hospital.</font>

494
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,001
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, grandma.</font>

495
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:45,236
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? The
customers are coming in!</font>

496
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I bought Yoo-sung's medicine.</font>

497
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:03,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Ever since last night, he won't stop
coughing, and his fever won't go down.</font>

498
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:07,591
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, let's take your
medicine before you sleep again.</font>

499
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:13,772
<font color=#FFFF00>So you were hiding here.</font>

500
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,150
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

501
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:17,871
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I doing here?</font>

502
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I came here
because I wanted to?</font>

503
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:23,134
<font color=#FFFF00>You bitch. I couldn't get in touch with you.</font>

504
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:29,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Who told you that you could move without
my permission when you borrowed my money?</font>

505
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:32,473
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'll definitely
pay you back the interest</font>

506
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:34,916
<font color=#FFFF00>by the end of this week.
Please give me some time.</font>

507
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,486
<font color=#FFFF00>If you didn't have the money to pay the
interest, why did you borrow my money?</font>

508
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:42,268
<font color=#FFFF00>No! You can't take that! I
have to pay for the room!</font>

509
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:48,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, take that ring from her.</font>

510
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:50,165
<font color=#FFFF00>You little bitch!</font>

511
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:59,884
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't even pay the interest, but
you were wearing such a big ring.</font>

512
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:02,681
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay the interest! How
can you take my ring?</font>

513
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:04,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Lady.</font>

514
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:06,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Take off that ring.</font>

515
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:09,861
<font color=#FFFF00>I-I can't give you this ring, even if I die.</font>

516
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:15,619
<font color=#FFFF00>- No! You can't!
- Give it to me!</font>

517
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:19,241
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this? Is this a silver ring?</font>

518
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:21,751
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh.
- Damn it!</font>

519
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,955
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a temporary phone.
Make sure you answer.</font>

520
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:29,758
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't answer, and I find
out you disappeared, you're dead!</font>

521
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,392
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, it's okay.</font>

522
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:50,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness! I can't do this anymore!
You don't have to</font>

523
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:53,643
<font color=#FFFF00>pay for the late room rent,
so leave here right now.</font>

524
00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:55,986
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ma'am.
- Ma'am...</font>

525
00:40:56,072 --> 00:40:58,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out this instant, or I'll kick you out!</font>

526
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:17,986
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung.</font>

527
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,704
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, are you okay?</font>

528
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:24,916
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang on, okay?</font>

529
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,756
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin is home.</font>

530
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm back.</font>

531
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:36,494
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Yoo-Jin.</font>

532
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:39,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin! Hee-dong! Put
your backpack away, and</font>

533
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:41,540
<font color=#FFFF00>hurry up and come here so
that we can play a game.</font>

534
00:41:41,924 --> 00:41:42,924
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

535
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:43,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

536
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:58,456
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought Hee-dong would divorce Shin-ae
because of the issue with Yoo-Jin.</font>

537
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:04,051
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he came back because you had
fainted and also for Yoo-jin's sake.</font>

538
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:10,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we allow that witch to be
next to our kind Hee-dong?</font>

539
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:19,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't you reveal Shin-ae's
true identity to Hee-dong now?</font>

540
00:42:20,177 --> 00:42:26,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, I don't want Hee-dong
to find out about that.</font>

541
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:29,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong sincerely loved her.</font>

542
00:42:30,505 --> 00:42:34,005
<font color=#FFFF00>If he finds out Shin-ae was pretending
to be your granddaughter all this time,</font>

543
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:38,716
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he'll be really heartbroken.</font>

544
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:47,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of that beast, the
house has become a mess.</font>

545
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:53,677
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll talk to Hee-dong and
convince him to get a divorce.</font>

546
00:42:54,716 --> 00:42:55,716
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

547
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:57,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do that.</font>

548
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,441
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father.
- Hey, Hee-dong.</font>

549
00:43:15,115 --> 00:43:16,115
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk.</font>

550
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

551
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:27,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, what are you
going to do about Shin-ae?</font>

552
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:31,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you decide to get
back together with her?</font>

553
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:34,513
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not it.</font>

554
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:37,911
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thinking about it. I'm
worried about Yoo-Jin as well.</font>

555
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:42,692
<font color=#FFFF00>You might think I'm
cold-hearted for saying this.</font>

556
00:43:44,177 --> 00:43:45,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin isn't your child.</font>

557
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,324
<font color=#FFFF00>You're attached to her,
so it might be difficult,</font>

558
00:43:52,822 --> 00:43:54,958
<font color=#FFFF00>but you have to end ties that must end.</font>

559
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:02,333
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae is a frightening woman
who deceived you and tried</font>

560
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,507
<font color=#FFFF00>to adopt her own daughter
she had with another man.</font>

561
00:44:06,138 --> 00:44:08,405
<font color=#FFFF00>How many times has she lied to us?</font>

562
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:13,056
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't trust her. I don't like her.
I'm scared of her.</font>

563
00:44:13,982 --> 00:44:16,317
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I want you to get a divorce.</font>

564
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:20,262
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

565
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:23,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Divorce?</font>

566
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,739
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you insane?</font>

567
00:44:26,662 --> 00:44:30,546
<font color=#FFFF00>You should help the kids live well, but
you're persuading him to get a divorce?</font>

568
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:34,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, you can't get a divorce!
Never! Don't listen to your dad!</font>

569
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:36,395
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out!</font>

570
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:38,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness. Why are you yelling?</font>

571
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:40,404
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Jo Dal-ho!</font>

572
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:43,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't tell me to get out! You get out!</font>

573
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:47,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have any lingering
attachment to you either!</font>

574
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:49,224
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Mom.</font>

575
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:54,237
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, don't listen to a word your dad is
saying! He's out of his mind! He's crazy!</font>

576
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,708
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what your dad did to me?</font>

577
00:44:57,372 --> 00:45:00,441
<font color=#FFFF00>He slapped my cheek in the hospital hallway!</font>

578
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:01,771
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

579
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:05,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? If you didn't, say so!</font>

580
00:45:06,014 --> 00:45:09,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you slap my cheek?</font>

581
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Even my mom never slapped me once!</font>

582
00:45:11,866 --> 00:45:14,099
<font color=#FFFF00>But who are you to slap my cheek?</font>

583
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:18,967
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you'll think about this
carefully and make the right choice.</font>

584
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:23,154
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going? Tell me the
reason why you slapped my cheek!</font>

585
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:25,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!</font>

586
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,709
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't know why you were
slapped, you're not even human.</font>

587
00:45:36,045 --> 00:45:40,053
<font color=#FFFF00>What the hell is he saying to his wife?</font>

588
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:47,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, if you upset me, too,
I really won't be able to live!</font>

589
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:49,162
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't get a divorce!</font>

590
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:52,334
<font color=#FFFF00>The day you get a divorce is the day I die!</font>

591
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:53,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

592
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:55,412
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't!</font>

593
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:11,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! How can you have an
appetite at this moment?</font>

594
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:14,956
<font color=#FFFF00>You made your son get a divorce!
You don't even</font>

595
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:18,086
<font color=#FFFF00>know where he is and if he's
sleeping or eating properly!</font>

596
00:46:18,366 --> 00:46:22,098
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he needed to get some fresh air.
He needs some time to think, too.</font>

597
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:26,286
<font color=#FFFF00>You wicked, spiteful wench!</font>

598
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:32,804
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jang-go.
- Oh, my baby. Jang-go.</font>

599
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:37,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness. What happened to your face?</font>

600
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:39,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You lost so much weight.</font>

601
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:41,826
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you eat?</font>

602
00:46:43,444 --> 00:46:44,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm hungry.</font>

603
00:46:44,897 --> 00:46:46,569
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I'll make you food.</font>

604
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:50,054
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'll do it. Jang-go, I'll make
you food, so just wait a little bit.</font>

605
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:56,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Good, good. Your mother made your
favorite hot and spicy beef stew.</font>

606
00:46:57,178 --> 00:46:59,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat that and shake everything off.</font>

607
00:47:02,826 --> 00:47:06,026
<font color=#FFFF00>Somehow, you'll be able to survive.
That's life.</font>

608
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:39,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I got rid of her dressing
table and belongings.</font>

609
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:42,178
<font color=#FFFF00>You two got a divorce. It's
over between you two, so</font>

610
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:44,487
<font color=#FFFF00>it would feel strange to still
have her things around.</font>

611
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:48,584
<font color=#FFFF00>The food is ready, so come out and eat.</font>

612
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,607
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, are you sleeping?</font>

613
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:19,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

614
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:21,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mi-poong.</font>

615
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:24,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you wait a long time? Is Yoo-sung okay?</font>

616
00:48:25,179 --> 00:48:28,287
<font color=#FFFF00>My work at the restaurant ended late,
so I couldn't take him to the hospital.</font>

617
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:30,521
<font color=#FFFF00>- I did buy more medicine though.
- You did?</font>

618
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,987
<font color=#FFFF00>Check his fever.</font>

619
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:36,201
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, what's wrong with Yoo-sung?</font>

620
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,474
<font color=#FFFF00>His body is burning up!</font>

621
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:42,428
<font color=#FFFF00>- We need to give him
the fever reducer first.
- Yes, let's do that.</font>

622
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:47,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung.</font>

623
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:50,060
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with him?</font>

624
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:54,076
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung. Mom, Yoo-sung is a bit strange.</font>

625
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:57,103
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with him? Yoo-sung!</font>

626
00:48:57,662 --> 00:49:00,560
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yoo-sung, it's me, Aunt Mi-poong.
- Yoo-sung, open your eyes!</font>

627
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:02,436
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung!</font>

628
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:06,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang on, Yoo-sung.</font>

629
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,709
<font color=#FFFF00>(Emergency Room)</font>

630
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

631
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, please check my grandson.
Please save him.</font>

632
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:26,817
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, what's wrong with my grandson?</font>

633
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't he have a cold?</font>

634
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he has cerebral meningitis.</font>

635
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:33,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Cerebral meningitis?</font>

636
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:35,087
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

637
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:41,336
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, dear. I didn't even know that...</font>

638
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:45,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, please save my Yoo-sung.</font>

639
00:49:46,093 --> 00:49:49,274
<font color=#FFFF00>In the case it's just a virus, he'll be
fine as long as the fever is reduced,</font>

640
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,809
<font color=#FFFF00>but if he has cerebral
bacterial meningitis and his</font>

641
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:56,384
<font color=#FFFF00>treatment is postponed, then
his life could be in danger.</font>

642
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:57,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

643
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,492
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be admitted and treated.</font>

644
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:01,890
<font color=#FFFF00>He needs to take a cerebrospinal
fluid examination</font>

645
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,868
<font color=#FFFF00>for the exact diagnosis,
so we'll do that first.</font>

646
00:50:04,524 --> 00:50:05,524
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

647
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:11,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Miss, please go to the first floor
and sign the papers. As soon as</font>

648
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:13,923
<font color=#FFFF00>that's done, he'll be put into a
hospital room and the exam will start.</font>

649
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:21,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, what do we do?</font>

650
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:24,176
<font color=#FFFF00>Where can we get the money?</font>

651
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:28,006
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I'm going to go to
my part-time job and ask</font>

652
00:50:28,031 --> 00:50:30,718
<font color=#FFFF00>my boss for an advanced pay.
I'll be back soon.</font>

653
00:50:34,837 --> 00:50:37,946
<font color=#FFFF00>He went to a house of morning?
When is he coming back?</font>

654
00:50:38,212 --> 00:50:39,664
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

655
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:45,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I would like an advance pay.
Is there anything you can do?</font>

656
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:48,021
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just a part-time worker.</font>

657
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,790
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do about Yoo-sung?</font>

658
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,383
<font color=#FFFF00>(Deokcheonok)</font>

659
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo.</font>

660
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

661
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,547
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. What brings you here?</font>

662
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:28,227
<font color=#FFFF00>It's cold. Come inside.</font>

663
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:33,168
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I was just passing by...</font>

664
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:40,610
<font color=#FFFF00>But is something wrong?</font>

665
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:44,813
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

666
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:47,477
<font color=#FFFF00>M-Mr. Jo...</font>

667
00:51:48,242 --> 00:51:49,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, go ahead.</font>

668
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,351
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very sorry for asking for this favor...</font>

669
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:00,946
<font color=#FFFF00>but can I borrow some money from you?</font>

670
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:03,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo...</font>

671
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:05,572
<font color=#FFFF00>A thousand dollars.</font>

672
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:07,992
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me borrow a thousand dollars.</font>

673
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:12,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Hold on.</font>

674
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,407
<font color=#FFFF00>I happen to have the amount.</font>

675
00:52:19,423 --> 00:52:20,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

676
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:24,110
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll never forget your kindness.</font>

677
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:29,274
<font color=#FFFF00>But may I ask you what's wrong?</font>

678
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:34,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo, I'll make sure to repay you.
I promise.</font>

679
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:36,852
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much.</font>

680
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:40,164
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo!</font>

681
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:10,383
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung.</font>

682
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:24,110
<font color=#FFFF00>(Call List Analysis Report)</font>

683
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:29,774
<font color=#FFFF00>That is what I got from investigating
Park Shin-ae's surroundings.</font>

684
00:53:30,423 --> 00:53:34,048
<font color=#FFFF00>After investigating her
phone, e-mail, and SNS,</font>

685
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,896
<font color=#FFFF00>I find out that the people she
contacted who are from North Korea</font>

686
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:45,032
<font color=#FFFF00>are twenty-eight-year-old Kim
Mi-poong and her mother Joo Young-ae.</font>

687
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:49,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong and Joo Young-ae?</font>

688
00:53:50,962 --> 00:53:51,962
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

689
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:58,992
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong and Joo Young-ae are the
only people she has been in contact with?</font>

690
00:53:59,391 --> 00:54:00,516
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that is correct.</font>

691
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:06,422
<font color=#FFFF00>I checked a few more times, but in the
end, there were only the two of them.</font>

692
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:11,532
<font color=#FFFF00>And in my opinion,</font>

693
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:19,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong might be the
granddaughter Mr. Kim is searching for.</font>

694
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:24,954
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong?</font>

695
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:28,313
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not her.</font>

696
00:54:29,055 --> 00:54:33,305
<font color=#FFFF00>I already know Kim
Mi-poong and Joo Young-ae.</font>

697
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,289
<font color=#FFFF00>They're not the ones I'm looking for.</font>

698
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Currently, this is all I have.</font>

699
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll investigate some more.</font>

700
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Please do that.</font>

701
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir.</font>

702
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,563
<font color=#FFFF00>- Kim Mi-poong!
- Yes!</font>

703
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:26,453
<font color=#FFFF00>- Kim Mi-poong!
- Yes!</font>

704
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:30,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, just in case, how about you meet Kim</font>

705
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:34,583
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong and Ms. Joo
Young-ae and talk with them?</font>

706
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, let's do that.</font>

707
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet them first.</font>

708
00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:40,586
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir.</font>

709
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:47,164
<font color=#FFFF00>The number you have dialed does
not exist, so please try again.</font>

710
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,352
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't get in touch with her?</font>

711
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:56,613
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo Young-ae isn't
answering her phone either.</font>

712
00:55:57,636 --> 00:55:59,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

713
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:02,129
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't get in touch with either of them?</font>

714
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:08,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, a few days ago, Ms. Joo
Young-ae came to borrow money from me.</font>

715
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:09,754
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

716
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:11,824
<font color=#FFFF00>She came to borrow money from you?</font>

717
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:14,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, she seemed very urgent.</font>

718
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:18,754
<font color=#FFFF00>She asked to borrow $1000, and I had a
check at the time, so I gave it to her.</font>

719
00:56:19,317 --> 00:56:21,817
<font color=#FFFF00>I was worried about her,
and I thought something</font>

720
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:24,261
<font color=#FFFF00>was strange, so I went
to the dumpling diner,</font>

721
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:27,692
<font color=#FFFF00>but according to others,
she had gone bankrupt.</font>

722
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:35,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Then call Mr. Kim and ask him
to track down the check.</font>

723
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir.</font>

724
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:01,831
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't put up an ad.</font>

725
00:57:02,129 --> 00:57:04,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you curious about your son?</font>

726
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:07,910
<font color=#FFFF00>My father is your son, too.</font>

727
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:17,746
<font color=#FFFF00>(Motel)</font>

728
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:30,401
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom, how much do we get
for folding one of these?
- Fifteen cents.</font>

729
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:34,104
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope I can fold many of these.</font>

730
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:39,166
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do I do it like this?
- Oh, leave it.
You must be tired after working.</font>

731
00:57:42,244 --> 00:57:43,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Who can it be?</font>

732
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather?</font>

733
00:57:55,057 --> 00:57:56,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

734
00:57:57,198 --> 00:57:59,463
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, grandfather is here.</font>

735
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:01,635
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come in.</font>

736
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:08,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, how did you know we were here?</font>

737
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,014
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a bit shabby, but
please have a seat here.</font>

738
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

739
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:15,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

740
00:58:16,565 --> 00:58:19,105
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not your father-in-law.</font>

741
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:21,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fake.</font>

742
00:58:23,176 --> 00:58:24,176
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

743
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:27,722
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean you're fake?</font>

744
00:58:28,191 --> 00:58:34,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I know I shouldn't have done that, but I
received a thousand dollars and lied to you.</font>

745
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,363
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you're really not my grandfather?</font>

746
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:47,167
<font color=#FFFF00>After I did that to you, I couldn't sleep
comfortably, since I deceived blood lines.</font>

747
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:52,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt like I would go to hell after I die.</font>

748
00:58:53,418 --> 00:58:55,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that? Why?</font>

749
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:59,566
<font color=#FFFF00>I did it because I was desperate for money.</font>

750
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:02,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that I think about it,</font>

751
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:07,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I think the people who hired
me to lie to you was trying</font>

752
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,859
<font color=#FFFF00>to prevent you from meeting
your real grandfather.</font>

753
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:14,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Who? Who hired you to do such a thing?</font>

754
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,632
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know their names.</font>

755
00:59:18,043 --> 00:59:20,917
<font color=#FFFF00>It was some woman and a young lady.</font>

756
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:24,401
<font color=#FFFF00>But I have a phone number.</font>

757
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:27,121
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

758
00:59:27,613 --> 00:59:28,613
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

759
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:33,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir...</font>

760
00:59:38,543 --> 00:59:40,010
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is he talking about?</font>

761
00:59:41,684 --> 00:59:43,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Who would do such a thing?</font>

762
00:59:45,129 --> 00:59:46,504
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me the phone number.</font>

763
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:49,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

764
00:59:57,715 --> 01:00:01,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Who on earth won't let us
meet Mi-poong's grandfather?</font>

765
01:00:01,637 --> 01:00:03,570
<font color=#FFFF00>They even made up a fake one.</font>

766
01:00:10,035 --> 01:00:11,035
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

767
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:14,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

768
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:20,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, but do you
know Mr. Kim Han-cheon?</font>

769
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:22,277
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim Han-cheon?</font>

770
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:25,809
<font color=#FFFF00>No. You got the wrong number.</font>

771
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:28,669
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what about Mr. Kim Bok-dong?</font>

772
01:00:29,551 --> 01:00:30,951
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I don't know him.</font>

773
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:33,074
<font color=#FFFF00>You got the wrong number.</font>

774
01:00:35,004 --> 01:00:36,222
<font color=#FFFF00>You really don't know him?</font>

775
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:40,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you prank-calling from?</font>

776
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,982
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know him!</font>

777
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:43,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on!</font>

778
01:00:45,793 --> 01:00:51,753
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance, are you Mr. Jo's wife?</font>

779
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:54,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

780
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,636
<font color=#FFFF00>You are Mr. Jo's wife!</font>

781
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:00,090
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm not! You got the wrong number!</font>

782
01:01:02,848 --> 01:01:05,515
<font color=#FFFF00>She used the money she
borrowed from you to pay for</font>

783
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung's examination
for cerebral meningitis?</font>

784
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:11,081
<font color=#FFFF00>I think that was why she
urgently borrowed money.</font>

785
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:14,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Then the hospital should
have her phone number.</font>

786
01:01:14,574 --> 01:01:16,808
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried the number, but
it doesn't exist anymore.</font>

787
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:18,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

788
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,816
<font color=#FFFF00>How can we not get in touch with her?</font>

789
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:23,206
<font color=#FFFF00>It can't be Kim Mi-poong.</font>

790
01:01:23,715 --> 01:01:27,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, let's go to the North
Korean Defector Center.</font>

791
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:34,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Seung-hee from North Korea
could be searching for Dae-hoon.</font>

792
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:35,738
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

793
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:39,019
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll contact the center.</font>

794
01:01:42,105 --> 01:01:43,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, he's on the list.</font>

795
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:46,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

796
01:01:48,176 --> 01:01:50,144
<font color=#FFFF00>There's someone looking for Kim Dae-hoon?</font>

797
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:52,706
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, there is. There's a video as well.</font>

798
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:56,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong and Joo Young-ae
are searching for Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

799
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:01,144
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Kim!
- W-Who?</font>

800
01:02:01,605 --> 01:02:05,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim... Kim Mi-poong?</font>

801
01:02:10,113 --> 01:02:11,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon...</font>

802
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:17,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Father. It's Seung-hee.</font>

803
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,300
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a long time, right?</font>

804
01:02:23,238 --> 01:02:32,894
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm living well here in South Korea using
the name that you gave me, Kim Mi-poong.</font>

805
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:44,964
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong. Do you remember
the name you gave me?</font>

806
01:02:47,832 --> 01:02:52,699
<font color=#FFFF00>All this time, mom and
I thought you had passed away.</font>

807
01:02:55,105 --> 01:03:05,417
<font color=#FFFF00>So we didn't think of finding you.
But we think we saw you here in South Korea.</font>

808
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,738
<font color=#FFFF00>The person we saw is you, isn't it?</font>

809
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:15,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, you're alive, aren't you?</font>

810
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,785
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss you so much.</font>

811
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:20,933
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad...</font>

812
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:24,878
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's make sure we meet.</font>

813
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:07,168
<font color=#FFFF00>(Blow Breeze)</font>

814
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,144
<font color=#FFFF00>They were looking for us all this time.</font>

815
01:04:09,675 --> 01:04:11,355
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

816
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:14,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Will your wrist break if you pour a drink?
I should just-!</font>

817
01:04:14,871 --> 01:04:15,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo's wife!</font>

818
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,574
<font color=#FFFF00>You mean Shin-ae's mother-in-law?</font>

819
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,253
<font color=#FFFF00>- How could you do that?
- I had no choice...</font>

820
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,996
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll look for a way to stow away.</font>

821
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:25,810
<font color=#FFFF00>You promised to stay by
my side no matter what!</font>

822
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:29,427
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where is she heading?
- I think Shin-ae did this.</font>

823
01:04:29,504 --> 01:04:31,973
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Mr. Kim your grandfather?</font>

824
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:34,435
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she? Let's go.</font>
