<font color="yellow">- That way! - Is this fun?</font>

<font color="yellow">Can't you tell? It's freaking fun!</font>

6
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,529
<font color="yellow">- Yes! That's right! - "Freaking fun?"</font>

7
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,145
<font color="yellow">Does that mean it's not fun?</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon isn't here.</font>

00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,392
<font color="yellow">Someone is calling you.</font>

33
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:58,488
<font color="yellow">You're leaving now?</font>

34
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:01,504
<font color="yellow">Okay. Call me when you're done.</font>

35
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,266
<font color="yellow">Nothing can go wrong.</font>

36
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,361
<font color="yellow">- I'm looking for someone. - Bye.</font>

37
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:24,818
<font color="yellow">Buy some rice cakes. They're two dollars each.</font>

38
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,995
<font color="yellow">Please give me two portions of dumplings.</font>

39
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,817
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. The dumplings are all sold out.</font>

40
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,194
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

41
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:35,777
<font color="yellow">I came all the way from Yeongdeungpo just to buy them.</font>

42
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:37,801
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

43
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,751
<font color="yellow">It's too bad then. I'll come next time.</font>

44
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,309
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare more dumplings next time.</font>

45
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,596
<font color="yellow">Please come back.</font>

46
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,380
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mi-poong. It's me.</font>

47
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:56,306
<font color="yellow">Mom, I have a lot of work today, so I won't be able to pick Yoo-sung up.</font>

48
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:57,556
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

49
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,821
<font color="yellow">Of course I'll pick him up then. There's nothing to worry about.</font>

50
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,196
<font color="yellow">You're not doing any rough labor behind my back just to make money, are you?</font>

51
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,170
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

52
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:12,948
<font color="yellow">Did you sell a lot of kimbap and dumplings today?</font>

53
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:18,451
<font color="yellow">I still have kimbap left over, but the dumplings were sold out a while ago.</font>

54
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:22,016
<font color="yellow">I think our dumplings are good. Everyone wants to buy them.</font>

55
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:25,496
<font color="yellow">Really? Then we should make more dumplings!</font>

56
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,123
<font color="yellow">Yes, we should.</font>

57
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,952
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at home.</font>

58
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,552
<font color="yellow">Be safe.</font>

59
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,806
<font color="yellow">- Buy rice cakes. They're two dollars. - It's cold!</font>

60
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:37,752
<font color="yellow">Do you have any dumplings?</font>

61
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,619
<font color="yellow">The dumplings are all sold out.</font>

62
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,416
<font color="yellow">Then please give me two rows of kimbap.</font>

63
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,633
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

64
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,762
<font color="yellow">- That will be four dollars. - Here you go.</font>

65
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,991
<font color="yellow">Please look at this.</font>

66
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,107
<font color="yellow">- (We're looking for someone) - What's this?</font>

67
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,264
<font color="yellow">It's a flier for a missing person.</font>

68
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,640
<font color="yellow">If you find someone like this, please contact the number here.</font>

69
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,666
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Thank you. Bye.</font>

70
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,778
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

71
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Isn't that Ms. Joo?</font>

72
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:19,772
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I heard they had lost their security deposit in a fraud.</font>

73
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:23,433
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. It's cold, but she's selling kimbap on the streets.</font>

74
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,248
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

75
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,763
<font color="yellow">- The first project. - What will happen?</font>

76
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:35,819
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

77
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,393
<font color="yellow">This is hilarious!</font>

78
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:42,314
<font color="yellow">It's so funny!</font>

79
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,893
<font color="yellow">Your mouth will rip apart from all the laughing.</font>

80
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,011
<font color="yellow">Mother, watch this with me.</font>

81
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,527
<font color="yellow">It's so funny!</font>

82
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:55,042
<font color="yellow">Look at Jung Jun-ha and Park Myung-soo. They're hilarious!</font>

83
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,508
<font color="yellow">What a good life you have.</font>

84
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:03,371
<font color="yellow">Some people struggle to make a living on the cold streets.</font>

85
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:08,427
<font color="yellow">You get to sit here in the warm house eating tangerines and laughing at other people.</font>

86
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,102
<font color="yellow">You don't want to see me laugh. Fine then.</font>

87
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:16,845
<font color="yellow">Delivery!</font>

88
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,800
<font color="yellow">- Please put it here. - Okay.</font>

89
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,213
<font color="yellow">- Good. - What's all this?</font>

90
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:24,238
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

91
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,263
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy so many quinces?</font>

92
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,311
<font color="yellow">Make quince tea.</font>

93
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,200
<font color="yellow">With all of these?</font>

94
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:32,986
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

95
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:36,960
<font color="yellow">Dice them into thin slices. Put your heart into making it.</font>

96
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:42,188
<font color="yellow">Mother, we can just buy tea in the market these days. Why did you buy all of these?</font>

97
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:46,094
<font color="yellow">Is buying it from the store and making it at home the same thing?</font>

98
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:49,836
<font color="yellow">Mother, it takes a lot of hard work to cut a quince up.</font>

99
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,107
<font color="yellow">It takes more work than cutting pumpkins.</font>

100
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:54,977
<font color="yellow">If I told you to do it, you should just do it.</font>

101
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:58,714
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back to your mother-in-law.</font>

102
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:04,157
<font color="yellow">Besides, would it be harder than making a hundred cabbages into kimchi?</font>

103
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,444
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and do it!</font>

104
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:14,762
<font color="yellow">For how much longer is she going to mention the hundred cabbages of kimchi?</font>

105
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,927
<font color="yellow">But when will I be able to cut up all of these?</font>

106
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,122
<font color="yellow">Here's your snack-</font>

107
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,529
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

108
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,154
<font color="yellow">We're in big trouble!</font>

109
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,452
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim's son is gone!</font>

110
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:48,952
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law?</font>

111
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,240
<font color="yellow">- Isn't he in his room?- No.</font>

112
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:53,951
<font color="yellow">I went to his room to give him his snack, but he wasn't</font>

113
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,708
<font color="yellow">there, so I checked upstairs, but he wasn't there either.</font>

114
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,487
<font color="yellow">Did he say he was going somewhere?</font>

115
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:01,948
<font color="yellow">No. He was definitely in his room earlier.</font>

116
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,690
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

117
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,001
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What happened?</font>

118
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,728
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law is missing.</font>

119
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,495
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious?</font>

120
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:13,295
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no! - Where did he go?</font>

121
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,219
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, thanks to Ms. Park's quick decision, the new products were</font>

122
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:21,361
<font color="yellow">able to come out right away, so the company didn't suffer much losses.</font>

123
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:23,908
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

124
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,733
<font color="yellow">Thank you, sir.</font>

125
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:32,350
<font color="yellow">From now on, make sure that the company information isn't leaked.</font>

126
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:34,207
<font color="yellow">- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.</font>

127
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:51,913
<font color="yellow">What do you mean my dad is missing?</font>

128
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:55,907
<font color="yellow">What? Dae-hoon is missing?</font>

129
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,402
<font color="yellow">What happened? Tell us the exact details.</font>

130
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,418
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

131
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:10,959
<font color="yellow">he was playing games and watching TV in the living room.</font>

132
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,309
<font color="yellow">He wasn't there though.</font>

133
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:19,295
<font color="yellow">I went to his bedroom to give him his snack, but he wasn't there.</font>

134
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:23,119
<font color="yellow">You really didn't see my dad leaving the house?</font>

135
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,145
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

136
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,164
<font color="yellow">- There wasn't anything strange either? - Of</font>

137
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,440
<font color="yellow">course not. There wasn't anything strange at all.</font>

138
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:32,971
<font color="yellow">Father really did leave the house by himself.</font>

139
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,915
<font color="yellow">- What? Let me see. - Sure.</font>

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,454
<font color="yellow">- Rewind it again. - Okay.</font>

141
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:02,033
<font color="yellow">Judging from his expression, he seemed pretty keyed up to go somewhere.</font>

142
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:06,475
<font color="yellow">What if he went to a nearby arcade or playground?</font>

143
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,705
<font color="yellow">That seems possible, sir.</font>

144
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,399
<font color="yellow">But why hasn't he come home yet?</font>

145
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:12,883
<font color="yellow">His phone is off, too.</font>

146
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,322
<font color="yellow">- We'll go look for him. Hee-dong, let's go. - Okay.</font>

147
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:22,189
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, you should stay home. It's cold outside.</font>

148
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,843
<font color="yellow">Mother and I will go find him.</font>

149
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:26,486
<font color="yellow">Being cold isn't the problem right now.</font>

150
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,111
<font color="yellow">I need to go find my son.</font>

151
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,639
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon!</font>

152
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:40,647
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

153
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:44,747
<font color="yellow">Did you see a man with glasses and white hair who speaks in a North Korean dialect?</font>

154
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,009
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

155
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,385
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Thank you.</font>

156
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:00,415
<font color="yellow">He's not here!</font>

157
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,945
<font color="yellow">- Dae-hoon! - Father!</font>

158
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,502
<font color="yellow">What happened? Did you see Dae-hoon?</font>

159
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,773
<font color="yellow">- No, we didn't. - Oh, no. Where on earth did he go?</font>

160
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,410
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather! - Mr. Kim, are you okay?</font>

161
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,540
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

162
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,027
<font color="yellow">He probably went somewhere.</font>

163
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:25,789
<font color="yellow">Just wait a little bit.</font>

164
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,050
<font color="yellow">These situations happen very often.</font>

165
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,955
<font color="yellow">He's over sixty years old. He'll be able to find his way home.</font>

166
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,694
<font color="yellow">He came from China just recently, and he's suffering from memory loss, too.</font>

167
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,351
<font color="yellow">He only has memories until he's ten years old. That's why we're doing this.</font>

168
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:45,609
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon doesn't know his way around.</font>

169
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,643
<font color="yellow">He doesn't know anything about Seoul.</font>

170
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:50,635
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have any money either.</font>

171
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,202
<font color="yellow">His phone is off as well.</font>

172
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:59,530
<font color="yellow">Please help us. My dad is like a ten-year-old child.</font>

173
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:03,512
<font color="yellow">Okay. We'll look into it.</font>

174
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,839
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Please go home and wait.</font>

175
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,450
<font color="yellow">Oh, hi, Won-bin!</font>

176
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,244
<font color="yellow">- Did you eat? - No.</font>

177
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:31,299
<font color="yellow">Then should I buy you bread or black bean noodles?</font>

178
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,087
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

179
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,283
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here to eat.</font>

180
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,810
<font color="yellow">I came here to sincerely talk to you.</font>

181
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:41,317
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

182
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,090
<font color="yellow">Sincerely talk to me?</font>

183
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,924
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's because you don't know what to call me, right?</font>

184
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,159
<font color="yellow">I was okay with you calling me Nam-yi.</font>

185
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:56,355
<font color="yellow">But since your dad told me not to call me that...</font>

186
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:58,460
<font color="yellow">How about Ms. Lee then?</font>

187
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,079
<font color="yellow">I cannot allow you and my father to date.</font>

188
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:03,826
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

189
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,795
<font color="yellow">So you're against our relationship?</font>

190
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:10,175
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

191
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:11,787
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

192
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:15,097
<font color="yellow">You like me though.</font>

193
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,338
<font color="yellow">Do you hate me?</font>

194
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,147
<font color="yellow">No, I like you.</font>

195
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,923
<font color="yellow">Then why are you against us?</font>

196
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,281
<font color="yellow">I like you, but I don't want you to be my fathers girlfriend.</font>

197
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,232
<font color="yellow">I really don't want you to be my mom.</font>

198
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,530
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

199
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,994
<font color="yellow">If I'm lacking in anything, or if there's something</font>

200
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,219
<font color="yellow">about me you don't like, tell me. I'll fix it.</font>

201
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,601
<font color="yellow">No, you don't have to do that.</font>

202
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,937
<font color="yellow">I just don't want my father to have a girlfriend.</font>

203
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,291
<font color="yellow">Then you...</font>

204
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:49,779
<font color="yellow">want your dad...</font>

205
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:54,748
<font color="yellow">to be alone for the rest of his life?</font>

206
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:56,165
<font color="yellow">Why is he alone?</font>

207
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,691
<font color="yellow">He has me, my grandmother, and my mom in heaven.</font>

208
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,260
<font color="yellow">I just want you to remain as an employee of this store and my friend.</font>

209
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:12,258
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that?</font>

210
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:13,656
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

211
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,387
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi. Nam-yi.</font>

212
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,652
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, what's wrong with her? What happened?</font>

213
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,698
<font color="yellow">Did you fight with her?</font>

214
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:38,523
<font color="yellow">Of course not. All I did was tell her my honest feelings.</font>

215
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:40,392
<font color="yellow">Your honest feelings?</font>

216
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:42,818
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

217
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:46,064
<font color="yellow">That I didn't want her to become your special girlfriend.</font>

218
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:50,330
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say a man only has one love?</font>

219
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:52,074
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

220
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,462
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll stick to your words.</font>

221
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:56,969
<font color="yellow">I'll be going to the academy now.</font>

222
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,517
<font color="yellow">Mother, are you taking those somewhere?</font>

223
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,863
<font color="yellow">Yes, you don't need to know where.</font>

224
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,832
<font color="yellow">How can you take those to someone else?</font>

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,520
<font color="yellow">I hurt my wrist making those. Look.</font>

226
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,466
<font color="yellow">Can't you see I put a patch here?</font>

227
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:33,068
<font color="yellow">There are people struggling to sell kimbap in the streets in this cold weather.</font>

228
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:37,355
<font color="yellow">And you're making a great fuss about making quince tea in a warm house?</font>

229
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:38,817
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

230
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:41,173
<font color="yellow">If I had forced you to make a hundred cabbages into</font>

231
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,411
<font color="yellow">kimchi, you would've gotten admitted to the hospital.</font>

232
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:47,545
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to talk about the hundred cabbages of kimchi?</font>

233
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:50,780
<font color="yellow">Until the day I die! Happy?</font>

234
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,750
<font color="yellow">Who on earth is struggling to sell kimbap in the streets?</font>

235
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:01,823
<font color="yellow">Is it...?</font>

236
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,743
<font color="yellow">Oh my god! My coat!</font>

237
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:22,273
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! What are you doing here?</font>

238
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:25,519
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, what are you going through?</font>

239
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:30,214
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I'm too ashamed to look at you.</font>

240
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:33,765
<font color="yellow">Still, I stopped by because I couldn't just ignore you.</font>

241
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,802
<font color="yellow">No. I wore a lot of clothes, so I'm fine.</font>

242
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:42,576
<font color="yellow">I sell a lot of dumplings, so that's a lot of fun.</font>

243
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:47,637
<font color="yellow">Then I'm glad.</font>

244
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:53,588
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside and have some warm tea. You can't be out here. It's too cold for you.</font>

245
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,369
<font color="yellow">No. Don't mind me at all.</font>

246
00:16:56,874 --> 00:17:02,286
<font color="yellow">I came here to give you something.</font>

247
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:07,836
<font color="yellow">They're not much, but I came here to give these to you.</font>

248
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:13,409
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. What are they? Oh, they're quince tea!</font>

249
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,891
<font color="yellow">My goodness. How did you manage to bring these in this cold weather?</font>

250
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

251
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,653
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's cold.</font>

252
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:37,312
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

253
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:42,633
<font color="yellow">Who did you give the quince tea, which I hurt myself making, to?</font>

254
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:44,706
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to know?</font>

255
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:48,384
<font color="yellow">I gave it to someone who deserves it.</font>

256
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,753
<font color="yellow">The one who deserves it is Mi-poong's mom?</font>

257
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,002
<font color="yellow">How can you do that?</font>

258
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:58,810
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't feel so wronged if you had given it to an orphanage or a nursing home.</font>

259
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:02,493
<font color="yellow">What? Did you follow me?</font>

260
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:05,568
<font color="yellow">Yes. I followed you because you were acting strange.</font>

261
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:07,599
<font color="yellow">Because I thought you were taking it to them.</font>

262
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,272
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

263
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,169
<font color="yellow">Do you feel so wronged about making quince tea?</font>

264
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:16,041
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal about giving them the quince tea?</font>

265
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,918
<font color="yellow">Mother, look at my wrist.</font>

266
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:24,161
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even lift my spoon earlier because of the pain from making that.</font>

267
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,676
<font color="yellow">But how can you give it to that woman?</font>

268
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:30,233
<font color="yellow">We have nothing to do with her anymore!</font>

269
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:34,473
<font color="yellow">Are you really asking me because you don't know the answer to that?</font>

270
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:41,482
<font color="yellow">I was scared you would drop to the pits of hell after you died. That's why I</font>

271
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:46,475
<font color="yellow">did this. Are you saying you don't understand my deep meaning behind this?</font>

272
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,576
<font color="yellow">Do you really not know?</font>

273
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:55,396
<font color="yellow">I don't. I really hate being linked to them in any way. How could you do this to me?</font>

274
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,113
<font color="yellow">I really can't live like this with you anymore.</font>

275
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,952
<font color="yellow">I really can't!</font>

276
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:06,034
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine!</font>

277
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:08,212
<font color="yellow">Let's end this once and for all!</font>

278
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:16,320
<font color="yellow">I can't live with an inconsiderate fool like you for an hour longer, so get out.</font>

279
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,636
<font color="yellow">Get out of this house at once, you awful wench!</font>

280
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:22,163
<font color="yellow">Mom! Geum-sil! What's wrong with the two of you?</font>

281
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:32,576
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be so obnoxious to people who are working hard to make a living!</font>

282
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:36,052
<font color="yellow">It is an old cow's notion that she never was a calf.</font>

283
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,245
<font color="yellow">Do you know you're the old cow?</font>

284
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:45,315
<font color="yellow">How is there not even one day of peace around here?</font>

285
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,079
<font color="yellow">Things are just getting worse and worse.</font>

286
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:05,675
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did he go in this cold weather?</font>

287
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,859
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

288
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,070
<font color="yellow">The police are looking for him, so he'll be found soon.</font>

289
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:14,917
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon doesn't know anything about the streets of Seoul.</font>

290
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:18,033
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have any money either.</font>

291
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,748
<font color="yellow">In this cold winter...</font>

292
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:29,232
<font color="yellow">What if he freezes to death in this cold weather?</font>

293
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,760
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, don't say such a thing.</font>

294
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:36,774
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather. Don't say that. Father will be back soon.</font>

295
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,482
<font color="yellow">I think he went to get some fresh air because</font>

296
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,539
<font color="yellow">he felt stuffy to just be inside the house.</font>

297
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:43,909
<font color="yellow">He's a bright boy- I mean, he's smart...</font>

298
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,237
<font color="yellow">so he'll come back for sure.</font>

299
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,634
<font color="yellow">But why isn't he answering his phone?</font>

300
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:54,214
<font color="yellow">I'd feel much better if I could just get in touch with him.</font>

301
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:58,108
<font color="yellow">We're locating his phone right now, so wait just a little bit longer.</font>

302
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:00,126
<font color="yellow">All right...</font>

303
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:17,462
<font color="yellow">This is the ship, right? Is everything prepared according to the plan?</font>

304
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:45,250
<font color="yellow">Why is the van door open?</font>

305
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,907
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

306
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:53,045
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you doing?</font>

307
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:58,147
<font color="yellow">Look for him over there! You go that way! You, follow me!</font>

308
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,702
<font color="yellow">Go that way!</font>

309
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,130
<font color="yellow">- Look for him back there! - Yes, sir!</font>

310
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,382
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

311
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:26,500
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to my truck?</font>

312
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,259
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for someone.</font>

313
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:29,964
<font color="yellow">Get out of here.</font>

314
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,061
<font color="yellow">Search for him back there!</font>

315
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,494
<font color="yellow">Is this Kim Dae-hoon's cell-phone?</font>

316
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:01,225
<font color="yellow">Yes! This is my son's cell-phone!</font>

317
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:03,240
<font color="yellow">Where did you find this?</font>

318
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,432
<font color="yellow">In the alley near the stationary store before the big street.</font>

319
00:24:07,898 --> 00:24:10,640
<font color="yellow">Then this means my dad passed by the alley.</font>

320
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,927
<font color="yellow">It seems like he had dropped his phone while he was passing by.</font>

321
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:19,474
<font color="yellow">Please show us the CCTV in that alley right now.</font>

322
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:20,887
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

323
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,656
<font color="yellow">There's a CCTV in front of the stationary store, but</font>

324
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:28,804
<font color="yellow">there aren't any near the alley where he disappeared.</font>

325
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:30,296
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

326
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:35,458
<font color="yellow">There are no CCTVs in that area?</font>

327
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,483
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

328
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:40,345
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

329
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,961
<font color="yellow">But there's someone who has witnessed Kim Dae-hoon today.</font>

330
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,843
<font color="yellow">A witness?</font>

331
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:51,980
<font color="yellow">Yes. A fourth-grade boy played games with him today.</font>

332
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:56,306
<font color="yellow">He said that Kim Dae-hoon got a phone call and ran off.</font>

333
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:02,376
<font color="yellow">Did that kid say that my son said anything else?</font>

334
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:05,327
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so.</font>

335
00:25:05,978 --> 00:25:08,965
<font color="yellow">That phone-call is suspicious.</font>

336
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:14,535
<font color="yellow">Please find out who made that phone-call to him.</font>

337
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,903
<font color="yellow">It's probably me. I had called him.</font>

338
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:24,073
<font color="yellow">According to the kid, he said Dae-hoon had run off after getting the phone-call,</font>

339
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,495
<font color="yellow">so I'm pretty sure it wasn't from you.</font>

340
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,047
<font color="yellow">Anyways, we'll know when we see the history of phone-calls.</font>

341
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:32,547
<font color="yellow">We'll call you after we investigate it further.</font>

342
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:40,903
<font color="yellow">My son should be able to find his house. Something definitely went wrong.</font>

343
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:44,365
<font color="yellow">I'll widen the search area and try to help you as much as I can.</font>

344
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,587
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

345
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,934
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Bye.</font>

346
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:54,261
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, where did you go? Dae-hoon!</font>

347
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,657
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather. - Dae-hoon.</font>

348
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,115
<font color="yellow">We're in trouble.</font>

349
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,791
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. My heart is thumping madly. I can't breathe.</font>

350
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:10,602
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to endure this even if I have ten hearts.</font>

351
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:13,120
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't suspect you, would they?</font>

352
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:15,397
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

353
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:18,501
<font color="yellow">Why does there have to be a witness?</font>

354
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:21,981
<font color="yellow">What would we have done if he had told the little</font>

355
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:23,729
<font color="yellow">boy he was on his way to meet his daughter?</font>

356
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:30,090
<font color="yellow">Cold sweat started to drip down my back when he said there was a witness.</font>

357
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,830
<font color="yellow">I almost fainted.</font>

358
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:37,977
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, do you think ship departed to China?</font>

359
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:41,261
<font color="yellow">Did those people call you?</font>

360
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,419
<font color="yellow">- Not yet. - Why not?</font>

361
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:49,521
<font color="yellow">The ship should have departed already! They should have already called you by now!</font>

362
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,480
<font color="yellow">What if something went wrong?</font>

363
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,652
<font color="yellow">Mother, just stay quiet!</font>

364
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:02,928
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

365
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,022
<font color="yellow">Did the ship leave?</font>

366
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:08,475
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

367
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,070
<font color="yellow">You lost him?</font>

368
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,561
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

369
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,722
<font color="yellow">Find him right now!</font>

370
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,110
<font color="yellow">What is it? What happened?</font>

371
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:32,203
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness...</font>

372
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,063
<font color="yellow">Oh, I need to go!</font>

373
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:26,796
<font color="yellow">My shoe!</font>

374
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,516
<font color="yellow">My shoe!</font>

375
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,352
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

376
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,181
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

377
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:50,833
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

378
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:57,618
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

379
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,248
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

380
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,421
<font color="yellow">I'm here, mother.</font>

381
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:10,966
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung!</font>

382
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:11,991
<font color="yellow">Uncle!</font>

383
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:15,494
<font color="yellow">Come here! Have you been doing well?</font>

384
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:19,132
<font color="yellow">Of course I've been doing well. What about you, uncle?</font>

385
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,382
<font color="yellow">I've been doing well, too.</font>

386
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:22,827
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

387
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:25,171
<font color="yellow">- I bought chicken. - Yes! It's chicken!</font>

388
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:27,591
<font color="yellow">Grandma, it's chicken!</font>

389
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,801
<font color="yellow">What about Mi-poong?</font>

390
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,747
<font color="yellow">Oh, she went to her part-time job.</font>

391
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:34,703
<font color="yellow">Work? What kind of part-time job?</font>

392
00:29:34,997 --> 00:29:36,530
<font color="yellow">She works at a convenience store.</font>

393
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:38,469
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

394
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:42,624
<font color="yellow">Grandma. Uncle. When are we going to eat chicken?</font>

395
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,119
<font color="yellow">Chicken? Should we eat it now?</font>

396
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:47,750
<font color="yellow">- Sit down, Jang-go. - Okay.</font>

397
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,321
<font color="yellow">Let's eat chicken.</font>

398
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,082
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

399
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,028
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat dinner yet?</font>

400
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,960
<font color="yellow">- It's good to see you. - It's really great to see you.</font>

401
00:29:59,985 --> 00:30:02,252
<font color="yellow">- You're the same. - I know he is!</font>

402
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:06,038
<font color="yellow">Let's congratulate our friend Lee Chang-ho for</font>

403
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:09,453
<font color="yellow">becoming the Korean branch manager of KALMA. Cheers!</font>

404
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:13,109
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Thank you.</font>

405
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:16,181
<font color="yellow">Seeing you guys makes me feel like I'm really in Korea.</font>

406
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:20,388
<font color="yellow">Chang-ho, are you back for good?</font>

407
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:23,543
<font color="yellow">Not yet. If things work out, that could become possible.</font>

408
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:29,405
<font color="yellow">Chang-ho, why didn't you get married yet?</font>

409
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:31,973
<font color="yellow">It's not because of Hee-ra, is it?</font>

410
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:33,600
<font color="yellow">Jo Mee-ryung!</font>

411
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,267
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

412
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:41,081
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. Anyways, I heard you got married, Hee-ra. What does your husband do?</font>

413
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,731
<font color="yellow">Oh, my husband?</font>

414
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:46,789
<font color="yellow">He's a free-lancer artist.</font>

415
00:30:48,271 --> 00:30:49,935
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

416
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,426
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Let me take this call.</font>

417
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:00,059
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me, Jang-soo.</font>

418
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,315
<font color="yellow">Baby, baby, my baby!</font>

419
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:06,419
<font color="yellow">I ended practice early, so I came to pick you up right away. I did well, didn't I?</font>

420
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:09,040
<font color="yellow">You're at Summer Winter, right?</font>

421
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
<font color="yellow">I'm right in the front.</font>

422
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,910
<font color="yellow">You're right in the front?</font>

423
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,469
<font color="yellow">Don't come here, Jang-soo.</font>

424
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,972
<font color="yellow">Go home first.</font>

425
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,809
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

426
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,341
<font color="yellow">I want to say hi to your friends.</font>

427
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:29,099
<font color="yellow">And I'm too nervous to let you ride the cab alone at night.</font>

428
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:30,657
<font color="yellow">I said I'm really fine!</font>

429
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,551
<font color="yellow">So don't come in and just go home first. Okay?</font>

430
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,001
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hee-ra? She hung up already?</font>

431
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:44,475
<font color="yellow">I'll just go by myself then.</font>

432
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,950
<font color="yellow">Today is a great day! Let's eat up!</font>

433
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:56,274
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

434
00:31:57,992 --> 00:31:58,992
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

435
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:08,924
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

436
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,029
<font color="yellow">May I join you?</font>

437
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:13,588
<font color="yellow">There's a seat just for me!</font>

438
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,960
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, I came pretty fast, didn't I?</font>

439
00:32:23,962 --> 00:32:26,980
<font color="yellow">So are you saying you did the right thing by</font>

440
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,820
<font color="yellow">dressing like this to come see my friends?</font>

441
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,299
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

442
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,838
<font color="yellow">And what's wrong with my outfit?</font>

443
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:37,924
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm naked.</font>

444
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:41,260
<font color="yellow">How can you say that after seeing my friends?</font>

445
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:46,034
<font color="yellow">My friend Chang-ho is the branch manager of the famous global company KALMA.</font>

446
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:50,346
<font color="yellow">My friend Mi-ryung's husband is the director of a plastic surgery hospital.</font>

447
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,595
<font color="yellow">Eun-mi's husband is a prosecutor.</font>

448
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,064
<font color="yellow">Now I see what you're trying to say.</font>

449
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:03,603
<font color="yellow">So you're saying you were embarrassed by me in front of your friends.</font>

450

00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,335
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

598
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:23,782
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, you're going to get really sick at this rate.</font>

599
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,504
<font color="yellow">What will I do if something happens to you, too?</font>

600
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,240
<font color="yellow">You need strength in order to find dad.</font>

601
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:32,589
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

602
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,394
<font color="yellow">What if someone kidnapped Dae-hoon?</font>

603
00:45:54,013 --> 00:45:55,013
<font color="yellow">Kidnap?</font>

604
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:57,394
<font color="yellow">Yes, kidnap!</font>

605
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:01,995
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, why would we not be able to find him?</font>

606
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,341
<font color="yellow">He wasn't kidnapped. If he was, we would've received a call for ransom right now.</font>

607
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:08,541
<font color="yellow">He's right, grandfather.</font>

608
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:14,184
<font color="yellow">Dad must have lost his way home. We reported it, so we'll be able to find him soon.</font>

609
00:46:15,046 --> 00:46:16,487
<font color="yellow">So please eat.</font>

610
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:21,220
<font color="yellow">I don't even know what happened...</font>

611
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:25,793
<font color="yellow">to my poor, mentally unstable son in this cold winter.</font>

612
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:31,444
<font color="yellow">How will I be able to eat this?</font>

613
00:46:31,881 --> 00:46:33,129
<font color="yellow">Grandfather.</font>

614
00:46:40,284 --> 00:46:44,164
<font color="yellow">That old man isn't even drinking a drop of water. What if he passes away like that?</font>

615
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:47,477
<font color="yellow">You're not even on the family registry yet!</font>

616
00:46:48,053 --> 00:46:50,251
<font color="yellow">I think you made the wrong decision this time.</font>

617
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:53,801
<font color="yellow">Still, it's better that he's gone this way.</font>

618
00:46:54,116 --> 00:46:55,289
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

619
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:59,348
<font color="yellow">That old man won't die so easily until he finds his son.</font>

620
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:05,013
<font color="yellow">We need to make sure he survives until your name is on the family registry.</font>

621
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:09,382
<font color="yellow">What if Mi-poong's father comes back here?</font>

622
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:15,745
<font color="yellow">He only rode around in a car, so he won't even know our address.</font>

623
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:17,786
<font color="yellow">He won't be able to find us.</font>

624
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:21,761
<font color="yellow">How could someone with a ten-year-old mind find his way back home? He'll never find us.</font>

625
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:27,490
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. If you watch TV, those kind of people get sold to shrimp boats.</font>

626
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:29,681
<font color="yellow">It'd be perfect if that happened to him!</font>

627
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,474
<font color="yellow">Oh, my back.</font>

628
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,999
<font color="yellow">Stop pooping!</font>

629
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:23,178
<font color="yellow">If you keep pooping, I'm going to set your butts on fire!</font>

630
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,906
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

631
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,099
<font color="yellow">How can you accept this?</font>

632
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:37,260
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to accept it at first.</font>

633
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:41,249
<font color="yellow">But we don't have anything.</font>

634
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:44,470
<font color="yellow">We need to work hard to find your father.</font>

635
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,195
<font color="yellow">That's why I accepted it.</font>

636
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:49,106

<font color="yellow">Jang-go told me to take this as alimony. If we don't</font>

640
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,783
<font color="yellow">accept it, imagine how uncomfortable he'll feel.</font>

641
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:08,475
<font color="yellow">He gave it to me because he knew you would reject it.</font>

643

709
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:51,864

00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:48,436
<font color="yellow">Of course. You got caught selling the company's information. What can't you do?</font>

747
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:52,095
<font color="yellow">Mother, I really didn't do that.</font>

748
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:56,406
<font color="yellow">And I'll make sure to pay Jang-go back in the future.</font>

749
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,027
<font color="yellow">So please don't talk that way.</font>

750
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:01,436
<font color="yellow">You're really funny.</font>

751
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,642
<font color="yellow">If you need money, you can borrow it from a bank or anywhere else.</font>

752
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,689
<font color="yellow">Why must you take money from Jang-go?</font>

753
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:09,066
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a lie that you're borrowing it from him?</font>

754
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:11,957
<font color="yellow">If you got a divorce, you should neatly step away from him.</font>

755
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,598
<font color="yellow">You're sticking to him like a parasite. What do you think you're doing?</font>

756
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,982
<font color="yellow">Mother, you're being too harsh.</font>

757
00:57:19,379 --> 00:57:20,473
<font color="yellow">I'm being too harsh?</font>

758
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,440
<font color="yellow">I think you're the one who's being harsh.</font>

759
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:26,387
<font color="yellow">You made my son into a divorcee.</font>

760
00:57:26,412 --> 00:57:28,848
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for you, Jang-go would've married Ha-yeon</font>

761
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:30,998
<font color="yellow">and become the son-in-law of Jang & Ko Law Firm.</font>

762
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,990
<font color="yellow">If I think about that, my heart still crumbles!</font>

763
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:44,326
<font color="yellow">I'm so relieved that I chased you out of my house.</font>

764
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:45,837
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

765
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:47,539
<font color="yellow">It's better this way.</font>

766
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:50,035
<font color="yellow">Just take that money and get the hell away from us.</font>

767
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:54,019
<font color="yellow">Get the hell away from my son! Go far away from him!</font>

768
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,466
<font color="yellow">Don't leech off my son any longer, you got it?</font>

769
00:57:58,237 --> 00:57:59,904
<font color="yellow">Your words are too cruel.</font>

770
00:58:02,094 --> 00:58:06,583
<font color="yellow">How can you speak so cruelly to your former daughter-in-law?</font>

771
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:09,288
<font color="yellow">I was the one who accepted that money.</font>

772
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:15,496
<font color="yellow">I'll pay him back somehow, so please stop treating Mi-poong this way.</font>

773
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:20,868
<font color="yellow">What did my son do to deserve all of this? Even his mother-in-law</font>

774
00:58:20,893 --> 00:58:24,937
<font color="yellow">is leeching off of him. My heart feels like it's collapsing!</font>

775
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,411
<font color="yellow">You were going to pay him back?</font>

776
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,017
<font color="yellow">You'll be the only woman in the world to borrow money</font>

777
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,383
<font color="yellow">from her former son-in-law to open up a business!</font>

778
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:33,998
<font color="yellow">- Mom! - If you had any shame, you wouldn't be able to do this!</font>

779
00:58:34,023 --> 00:58:35,023
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

780
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,571
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

781
00:58:38,596 --> 00:58:43,096
<font color="yellow">- I came here because I was so furious! - Get out.</font>

782
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:47,201
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you better not leech off my son again!</font>

783
00:58:47,226 --> 00:58:49,949
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up! - I won't leave you alone then!</font>

784
00:59:08,227 --> 00:59:09,227
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

785
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,727
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! What are you doing? Let go!</font>

786
00:59:14,037 --> 00:59:15,983
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you doing this?</font>

787
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,408
<font color="yellow">I gave that money to Mi-poong as alimony.</font>

788
00:59:19,006 --> 00:59:20,974
<font color="yellow">What? As alimony?</font>

789
00:59:21,797 --> 00:59:25,446
<font color="yellow">Why would you give her alimony? Were you the one who broke this family apart?</font>

790
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:28,767
<font color="yellow">This house didn't have one day of peace because of her!</font>

791
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:31,014
<font color="yellow">So why would you give her alimony?</font>

792
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:33,893
<font color="yellow">She should give you alimony for ruining your life!</font>

793
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:36,579
<font color="yellow">Mom, stop being obstinate.</font>

794
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:39,105
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm upset.</font>

795
00:59:39,738 --> 00:59:42,309
<font color="yellow">Who will know about my broken heart?</font>

796
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:45,739
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong and I didn't get a divorce because we disliked each other.</font>

797
00:59:46,312 --> 00:59:48,769
<font color="yellow">She left home because she was hurt by you!</font>

798
00:59:49,643 --> 00:59:50,643
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

799
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:56,105
<font color="yellow">I tried to accept her and live with her somehow for your sake.</font>

800
00:59:56,629 --> 00:59:59,161
<font color="yellow">But do you want me to allow that thief who</font>

801
00:59:59,186 --> 01:00:02,011
<font color="yellow">embarrassed our family to be my daughter-in-law?</font>

802
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:05,119
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

803
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:08,478
<font color="yellow">What's the point of talking about all of this now?</font>

804
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:12,526
<font color="yellow">You gave it to her as alimony anyways, so it's all over now.</font>

805
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:15,798
<font color="yellow">So back off her now.</font>

806
01:00:16,076 --> 01:00:18,077
<font color="yellow">Don't go anywhere near her.</font>

807
01:00:18,872 --> 01:00:21,227
<font color="yellow">End it with the alimony. Got it?</font>

808
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,274
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, mother.</font>

809
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:00,608
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mi-poong.</font>

810
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:01,794
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

811
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:04,684
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

812
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,613
<font color="yellow">(Father's Dumplings)</font>

813
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

814
01:01:23,904 --> 01:01:25,153
<font color="yellow">I'll apologize on her behalf.</font>

815
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:29,776
<font color="yellow">My mother won't come back here ever again.</font>

816
01:01:31,237 --> 01:01:32,536
<font color="yellow">You're very angry, aren't you?</font>

817
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:39,269
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I'm not angry.</font>

818
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:44,391
<font color="yellow">And I don't want to fight with you about things like this anymore.</font>

819
01:01:46,376 --> 01:01:51,956
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to work hard and do whatever I can to pay you back.</font>

820
01:01:52,987 --> 01:01:54,306
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking that way?</font>

821
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:57,401
<font color="yellow">Why can't you realize my feelings?</font>

822
01:01:57,639 --> 01:01:59,013
<font color="yellow">What will happen if I do?</font>

823
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:03,050
<font color="yellow">You saw what your mother did earlier.</font>

824
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:06,993
<font color="yellow">We won't work out.</font>

825
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:12,386
<font color="yellow">You do know our court appointment is coming up soon, right?</font>

826
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,948
<font color="yellow">We'll see each other then.</font>

827
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:21,372
<font color="yellow">And don't come back here ever again.</font>

828
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:51,972
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, did you see a man with white hair wearing glasses?</font>

829
01:03:51,516 --> 01:03:55,531
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? - I'm going to Seoul. Give me a ride. Please?</font>

830
01:04:35,984 --> 01:04:39,459
<font color="yellow">Go away!</font>

831
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:40,951
<font color="yellow">Oh, that awful stench!</font>

832
01:04:41,158 --> 01:04:45,461
<font color="yellow">Business isn't doing well either! My goodness!</font>

833
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:47,326
<font color="yellow">Go away!</font>

834
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:56,401
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

853
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:41,448
