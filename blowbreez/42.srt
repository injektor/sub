The delivery was tiring, wasn't it?</font>

83
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,756
<font color="yellow">No. Since there are many customers
and business is going well,</font>

90
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,301
<font color="yellow">She must have called
because it's past the time</font>

91
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,143
<font color="yellow">to pick him up. Go ahead and call her back.</font>

92
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,725
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

93
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:46,824
<font color="yellow">Hello, teacher. I'm Yoo-sung's grandmother.</font>

94

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

96
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:56,756
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung went to Yoo-jin's house?</font>

97
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:06,672
<font color="yellow">The spicy rice cakes are yummy.</font>

98
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:10,431
<font color="yellow">My grandma makes yummy spicy rice cakes, too.</font>

99
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:12,651
<font color="yellow">Do you live with your grandma?</font>

100
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:15,748
<font color="yellow">Yes. I live with my grandma and aunt.</font>

101

<font color="yellow">What about your mom and dad?</font>

102
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:22,381
<font color="yellow">My mom and dad are in heaven.</font>

103
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:25,474
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

104
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:31,466
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, eat a lot, and come to
our house whenever you want.</font>

105
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:34,693
<font color="yellow">My father said the owner of this house is me.</font>

106
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:38,076
<font color="yellow">So come over whenever you want. Okay?</font>

107
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,459
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr. Kim.</font>

108
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:45,356

the owner of this house?</font>

109
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:49,293

owner of this house is me!</font>

110
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:50,897

113
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,076

- Yes.</font>

119
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,779
<font color="yellow">I'll bring him down soon.</font>

120
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:25,568
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

121
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,865
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, quickly put your jacket on
and get your backpack.</font>

122
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,783
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. Isn't that Mi-poong's mom?</font>

123
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,076
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

124
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,888
<font color="yellow">What is she doing here?</font>

125
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:58,073
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. She knows I stole her toothbrush.
That's why she's here! What do we do?</font>

126
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:03,252
<font color="yellow">Or did she come here to tell Dal-ho
that I snuck into her house?</font>

127
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:05,426
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

128
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,044
<font color="yellow">Mother, calm down!
That's not the problem right now!</font>

129
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,530
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

130
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:16,482
<font color="yellow">She's not here because she knows
her husband is at our house, is she?</font>

131
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,495
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

132
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:23,083
<font color="yellow">What if she bumps into Mr. Kim and his son?</font>

133
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:27,904
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. Just thinking about it
makes me want to faint. What do we do?</font>

134
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,680
<font color="yellow">The first thing we need to do
is find out why she's here.</font>

135
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,811
<font color="yellow">So ask her why she came here.</font>

136
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,276
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

137
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,678
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, what are you doing here?</font>

138
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:59,857
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? Did you
come here to meet my husband?</font>

139
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:02,227
<font color="yellow">How brazen you must be to come here.</font>

140
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,711
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that such a crazy
woman is your mother-in-law.</font>

141
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,675
<font color="yellow">What? "Crazy woman?"</font>

142
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,698
<font color="yellow">- Are you done talking?
- Mother.</font>

143
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:20,043
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung is playing here,
so I came to pick him up.</font>

144
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,231
<font color="yellow">He is?</font>

145
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:27,333
<font color="yellow">What? Who's here? How come
he always comes to our house?</font>

146
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,540
<font color="yellow">He must think this is his playground!</font>

147
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,937
<font color="yellow">You should know how to act
according to the circumstances.</font>

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,832
<font color="yellow">How can you send that kid here?</font>

149
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:36,697
<font color="yellow">Do you have any conscience?</font>

150
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:42,409
<font color="yellow">I didn't send him here on purpose.
The kids came here after school on their own.</font>

151
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:44,708
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

152
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:47,780
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

153
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,859
<font color="yellow">Please wait a moment.</font>

154
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,998
<font color="yellow">After Yoo-sung puts his jacket on,
I'll bring him out.</font>

155
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,816
<font color="yellow">I'll be going in now.</font>

156
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,747
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, I'll do it for you.</font>

157
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,601
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-sung, come over again.
- Okay.</font>

158
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,407
<font color="yellow">You're so cute.</font>

159
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:24,319
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

160
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,272
<font color="yellow">Your hands are tiny, too.</font>

161
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,045
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, are you leaving?</font>

162
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,153
<font color="yellow">Yes. My grandma came to pick me up.</font>

163
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:34,654
<font color="yellow">I see. Did you have fun?</font>

164
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,764
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Father, I'll take him.</font>

165
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:37,789
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

166
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,521
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take him.</font>

167
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Yoo-sung.</font>

168
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,896
<font color="yellow">Oh, Shin-ae, are you just coming now?</font>

169
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:49,139
<font color="yellow">Yes, dad.</font>

170
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,943
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, it's okay. She's my daughter.</font>

171
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,334
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

172
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:57,928
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

173
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:01,169
<font color="yellow">Dad, are you going somewhere?</font>

174
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,287
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yoo-sung's grandma is waiting outside,</font>

175
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,283
<font color="yellow">so I'm going to take him to the front gate.</font>

176
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:07,396
<font color="yellow">I'll take him!</font>

177
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:08,842
<font color="yellow">Oh, no, Ms. Ma.</font>

178
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,428
<font color="yellow">I brought him, so I'm going to take him.</font>

179
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,667
<font color="yellow">Dad, let my mother-in-law
take Yoo-sung.</font>

180
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,795
<font color="yellow">You and I need to talk.
I need to tell you something.</font>

181
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,209
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

182
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:26,575
<font color="yellow">You can tell me after I take
Yoo-sung to his grandma.</font>

183
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:31,551
<font color="yellow">No, dad! What if you get lost like last time?</font>

184
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,088
<font color="yellow">I'll go with them.</font>

185
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,194
<font color="yellow">I'll take him!</font>

186
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,659
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with her? Yoo-sung!
- No, dad! Don't go outside!</font>

187
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,412
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, what's wrong?</font>

188
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:52,178
<font color="yellow">I don't want my dad to meet strangers.</font>

189
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,881
<font color="yellow">I'm scared something awful will happen to him.</font>

190
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,742
<font color="yellow">Am I stupid enough to
get lost in front of the house?</font>

191
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,010
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep treating me like I'm stupid?</font>

192
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:07,467
<font color="yellow">On top of that, Yoo-sung is Yoo-jin's friend,
so how can his grandma be a stranger?</font>

193
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim!</font>

194
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:17,076
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae...</font>

195
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:23,676
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel, but aren't
you acting too sensitive about him?</font>

196
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,568
<font color="yellow">I was?</font>

197
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:29,528
<font color="yellow">Yes. He can think on his own, but you keep</font>

198
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:32,414
<font color="yellow">treating him like a child in front of Yoo-jin.</font>

199
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,995
<font color="yellow">His pride must have been wounded.</font>

200
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,888
<font color="yellow">I think you're right.</font>

201
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,325
<font color="yellow">I should apologize to him.</font>

202
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:46,755
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he coming out?</font>

203
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:48,174
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can go inside.</font>

204
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,352
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-sung!
- Grandma!</font>

205
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:53,377
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

206
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,021
<font color="yellow">Don't ever come to my house again!</font>

207
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,040
<font color="yellow">Don't send him to our house again!</font>

208
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,412
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't be meeting like this!</font>

209
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,248
<font color="yellow">Don't yell at my grandma.</font>

210
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:12,392
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin and Mr. Kim were
the ones who invited me first.</font>

211
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:17,585
<font color="yellow">And Mr. Kim is the owner of the house,
so why are you being like this?</font>

212
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:19,224
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

213
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:26,646
<font color="yellow">That little brat! Oh my god!
Like grandma, like grandson!</font>

214
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,475
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

215
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,405
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

216
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:40,029
<font color="yellow">Grandma, that witch got punished!</font>

217
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:43,167
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, you shouldn't do that.</font>

218
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:46,909
<font color="yellow">If you laugh when she fell,
she'll be embarrassed.</font>

219
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,692
<font color="yellow">I don't like that lady.
She seems like a mean one.</font>

220
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,830
<font color="yellow">Still, you shouldn't say things like that.</font>

221
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:55,819
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

222
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,733
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo!</font>

223
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:15,309
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

224
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,334
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

225
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,920
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

226
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:22,080
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

227
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:23,935
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

228
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:25,717
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

229
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,178
<font color="yellow">Wow. You grew a lot.</font>

230
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,436
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

231
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,668
<font color="yellow">It's cold. Get in. I'll take you home.</font>

232
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:36,662
<font color="yellow">No. We can ride the bus.</font>

233
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:38,743
<font color="yellow">The bus stop is far from here.</font>

234
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,108
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

235
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:44,397
<font color="yellow">Thank you, but it's fine. Good-bye.</font>

236
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,537
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-sung.
- Hmmm?</font>

237
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:22,638
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't go to Yoo-jin's house.</font>

238
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:24,943
<font color="yellow">Can you promise me that you won't?</font>

239
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:28,041
<font color="yellow">Why? Why shouldn't I go there?</font>

240
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:33,920
<font color="yellow">Well, if you go to Yoo-jin's house,</font>

241
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:37,943
<font color="yellow">it'll put your aunt and me
in an awkward position.</font>

242
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,139
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

243
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:45,256
<font color="yellow">I'll explain everything to you
when you get older.</font>

244
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:49,478
<font color="yellow">So don't go to Yoo-jin's
house from now on, okay?</font>

245
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,482
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't go if you tell me not to go.</font>

246
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,921
<font color="yellow">That's a good boy.</font>

247
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:00,316
<font color="yellow">You can play with Yoo-jin
as much as you want at school.</font>

248
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,223
<font color="yellow">Okay, grandma.</font>

249
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:05,369
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

250
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:08,818
<font color="yellow">Let's play after we organize your backpack.</font>

251
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:13,896
<font color="yellow">Today-</font>

252
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung.</font>

253
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,843
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, you shouldn't use
these papers to fold them into cards.</font>

254
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:39,861
<font color="yellow">These are important papers your aunt
and I made in order to find your grandpa.</font>

255
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,234
<font color="yellow">Grandpa?</font>

256
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:44,903
<font color="yellow">Yes. You remember your grandpa, don't you?</font>

257
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:48,326
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

258
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:54,560
<font color="yellow">We think your grandpa
is alive here in South Korea.</font>

259
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:01,816
<font color="yellow">Since we need to find him using these papers,
don't fold them into cards again, okay?</font>

260
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,030
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

261
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,217
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

262
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:07,725
<font color="yellow">I'll make cards for you
out of the calendar. Okay?</font>

263
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:09,076
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

264
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,263
<font color="yellow">- (We are looking for someone)
- You unfold these, too.</font>

265
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:25,252
<font color="yellow">How did you manage to fold all of these?</font>

266
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:37,163
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, I'm home.</font>

267
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,256
<font color="yellow">Welcome, father!</font>

268
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:44,153
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
You're not even looking at me.</font>

269
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:46,932
<font color="yellow">What are those?</font>

270
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,896
<font color="yellow">This is my treasure box.</font>

271
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:51,998
<font color="yellow">Treasure box?</font>

272
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,725
<font color="yellow">Inside are treasure cards from my friend.</font>

273
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:01,667
<font color="yellow">So, father, don't touch this
treasure box without my permission!</font>

274
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:04,154
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't.</font>

275
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:07,420
<font color="yellow">Who would touch your treasure box?</font>

276
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:21,826
<font color="yellow">Mother, the spicy
yellow croaker stew is delicious!</font>

277
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,732
<font color="yellow">Really? Eat a lot.</font>

278
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:27,303
<font color="yellow">Try the cockle, too. It's in season nowadays.</font>

279
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,688
<font color="yellow">It's delicious! It's so chewy!</font>

280
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:37,156
<font color="yellow">There's a lot of iron in it, so it's good
for anemia and other things. Eat up.</font>

281
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,734
<font color="yellow">It's tiring to work, isn't it?</font>

282
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:42,998
<font color="yellow">No, mother.</font>

283
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:52,386
<font color="yellow">Even if you had sweetly
told Mi-poong to try a cockle,</font>

284
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,734
<font color="yellow">she wouldn't have left the house
determined to get divorced.</font>

285
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,357
<font color="yellow">Mother, are you done eating?</font>

286
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,704
<font color="yellow">I made your favorite water parsley
and salted oysters for you.</font>

287
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:08,212
<font color="yellow">Do you know what tomorrow is?</font>

288
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:10,552
<font color="yellow">Even if no one else does, you would know...</font>

289
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:12,740
<font color="yellow">because it's the day you've been waiting for.</font>

290
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:18,489
<font color="yellow">It's the day that Mi-poong and
Jang-go will be officially divorced.</font>

291
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,814
<font color="yellow">I can't even manage to swallow my food.</font>

292
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:24,982
<font color="yellow">How would Mi-poong and Jang-go feel right now?</font>

293
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,022
<font color="yellow">Then tomorrow is the day they'll make
the final decision about the divorce?</font>

294
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,233
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

295
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:39,047
<font color="yellow">Why? Eat some more.</font>

296
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:48,490
<font color="yellow">It's not like this is new.
It's already been decided anyways.</font>

297
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,763
<font color="yellow">Why is she doing that and
ruining everyone's appetites?</font>

298
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:57,084
<font color="yellow">I was going to drop off Yoo-sung at the

with her for your son's sake!</font>

444
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:23,418
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

445
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:26,769
<font color="yellow">Don't talk so easily about this just
because it's someone else's business!</font>

446
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:29,238
<font color="yellow">Would Geum-sil have done
that if things hadn't been so bad?</font>

447
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,363
<font color="yellow">So is the consideration period over?</font>

448
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:34,607
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's over, so they went to court today.</font>

449
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,916
<font color="yellow">Once the divorce is finalized and they turn in</font>

450
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:38,910
<font color="yellow">the papers to the
borough office, it'll be over.</font>

451
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,472
<font color="yellow">Anyways, you must feel much better now.</font>

452
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,264
<font color="yellow">You guys should also search
for a prospective marriage partner</font>

453
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:46,214
<font color="yellow">for Geum-sil's son. I'm looking, too.</font>

454
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:49,230
<font color="yellow">Won't her son make a fine partner?</font>

455
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,855
<font color="yellow">Yes, but he still has
feelings for his ex-wife.</font>

456
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,816
<font color="yellow">Would any woman want to get married to him?</font>

457
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:59,831
<font color="yellow">If he was wealthy, at least women
would get married to him for the money.</font>

458
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,925
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. Don't get offended.</font>

459
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:07,838
<font color="yellow">Wasn't I telling the truth though?</font>

460
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:11,371
<font color="yellow">- Just eat the porridge.
- Let me taste it.</font>

461
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:13,923
<font color="yellow">Try it. It's good.</font>

462
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:27,295
<font color="yellow">Mom, how would Mi-poong
and Jang-go feel right now?</font>

463
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:30,414
<font color="yellow">Divorce is very heartbreaking.</font>

464
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,996
<font color="yellow">I know that better than anyone else.</font>

465
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:37,511
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're his aunt. Don't you know him?</font>

466
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,921
<font color="yellow">Jang-go didn't go to court.</font>

467
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,623
<font color="yellow">He didn't get a divorce.</font>

468
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,478
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about?</font>

469
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,980
<font color="yellow">Take a look at this.</font>

470
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:56,503
<font color="yellow">Do they look like they're
going to get a divorce?</font>

471
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:01,902
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! They went sledding together
when they're in the middle of a divorce?</font>

472
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,159
<font color="yellow">They're so weird!</font>

473
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:09,535
<font color="yellow">What's weird about that? They love each other,
so they can go sledding together.</font>

474
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:12,922
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil thinks they're
about to get a divorce.</font>

475
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,767
<font color="yellow">The house is about to get noisy again.</font>

476
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,761
<font color="yellow">I should move out!</font>

477
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:19,926
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

478
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:22,695
<font color="yellow">Did your boss ask you to live with him?</font>

479
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:24,574
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

480
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:27,762
<font color="yellow">Hello, ma'am.</font>

481
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,730
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

482
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,753
<font color="yellow">If you didn't, would you like me
to order something for you?</font>

483
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:34,425
<font color="yellow">No, I already ate.</font>

484
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:36,699
<font color="yellow">- Sit down.
- Sure.</font>

485
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:52,207
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim,</font>

486
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:59,714
<font color="yellow">I'm not against you dating my daughter.</font>

487
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:03,535
<font color="yellow">After watching you
all this time, I realized...</font>

488
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,332
<font color="yellow">you're faithful,</font>

489
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,129
<font color="yellow">kind,</font>

490
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:09,167
<font color="yellow">and good-looking.</font>

491
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:11,106
<font color="yellow">Thank you, ma'am.</font>

492
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,545
<font color="yellow">- But...
- Mom, what are you going to say?</font>

493
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,785
<font color="yellow">Just hold still.</font>

494
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,917
<font color="yellow">You can speak comfortably.</font>

495
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:26,910
<font color="yellow">The two of you are old enough.</font>

496
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:31,614
<font color="yellow">If you're going to just have a "fling," as the</font>

497
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,775
<font color="yellow">young ones call it nowadays, don't even start.</font>

498
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,932
<font color="yellow">I can never allow that.</font>

499
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:39,957
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

500
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,160
<font color="yellow">I heard your family motto is
"don't live a vague life."</font>

501
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,608
<font color="yellow">So what I mean is, don't date vaguely.
I want the two of you to date</font>

502
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:54,769
<font color="yellow">with certainty while promising to
be with each other in the future.</font>

503
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:57,232
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, ma'am.</font>

504
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,246
<font color="yellow">I'm not a vague person.</font>

505
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:01,740
<font color="yellow">I, Kim Seung-jun,</font>

506
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:08,045
<font color="yellow">am sincere about dating Nam-yi, mother.</font>

507
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:10,138
<font color="yellow">Mother?</font>

508
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:22,818
<font color="yellow">These two are very passionate
about each other.</font>

509
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:31,224
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come out, father! Hurry!</font>

510
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:34,504
<font color="yellow">Dad, why are you waiting for grandfather?</font>

511
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:39,187
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry up and go look
for the dumpling diner, father!</font>

512
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,477
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, how about we go look
for that dumpling diner next time?</font>

513
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:48,897
<font color="yellow">I have something important
to do today, so I need to go out.</font>

514
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:52,173
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

515
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:54,909
<font color="yellow">Dad, go with me then.</font>

516
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,486
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, I'll take him.</font>

517
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:03,761
<font color="yellow">That sounds like a good idea, Dae-hoon.
Shin-ae knows Seoul streets better than I do.</font>

518
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:05,802
<font color="yellow">No, father!</font>

519
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:07,777
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go with you.</font>

520
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:11,396
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'll find it with you. Go with me, okay?</font>

521
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,123
<font color="yellow">No! I'm going to go with father!</font>

522
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,148
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

523
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,584
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, are you okay?</font>

524
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:21,416
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

525
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:23,108
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

526
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:26,115
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, what do you
think you're doing to her?</font>

527
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,935
<font color="yellow">I hate Shin-ae!</font>

528
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:30,674
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go with her, father!</font>

529
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:31,983
<font color="yellow">Fine, fine.</font>

530
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,232
<font color="yellow">Then put on your jacket and get ready.</font>

531
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:38,662
<font color="yellow">Oh, my jacket!</font>

532
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:40,865
<font color="yellow">Okay, father!</font>

533
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:46,084
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae...</font>

534
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,722
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Are you all right?</font>

535
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:49,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

536
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:55,162
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, your father is ill right now.</font>

537
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:58,849
<font color="yellow">If you don't understand him, who else will?</font>

538
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:05,014
<font color="yellow">I know, grandfather, but it still upsets me.</font>

539
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:06,592
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

540
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:11,680
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I know that you're upset?</font>

541
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:14,914
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

542
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:22,391
<font color="yellow">Have some tea. It's quince tea that I made.</font>

543
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,273
<font color="yellow">The color is pretty.</font>

544
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,430
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, it smells nice. It tastes good, too.</font>

545
00:37:29,758 --> 00:37:32,680
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, is that a diamond necklace?</font>

546
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:33,977
<font color="yellow">Oh, this?</font>

547
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,867
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a diamond necklace.</font>

548
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:40,234
<font color="yellow">It's pretty! You must have spent a
fortune on it. Where'd you get it from?</font>

549
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,777
<font color="yellow">Where else?</font>

550
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:43,619
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law.</font>

551
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:46,744
<font color="yellow">I envy you! Since you have
a well-off daughter-in-law,</font>

552
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:48,965
<font color="yellow">you get things like that. You're lucky!</font>

553
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:51,455
<font color="yellow">That's my phone.</font>

554
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,719
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's my daughter-in-law.</font>

555
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:58,094
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

556
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,780
<font color="yellow">Mother, where are you right now?</font>

557
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:06,844
<font color="yellow">I told you to watch my dad!
What are you doing out so early?</font>

558
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:12,344
<font color="yellow">What else? I'm meeting my friends?</font>

559
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:14,096
<font color="yellow">Meeting your friends?</font>

560
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:18,173
<font color="yellow">Mother, this isn't the time
for that right now.</font>

561
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,211
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come back. Hurry!</font>

562
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:22,972
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be there soon.</font>

563
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,907
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go home first.</font>

564
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:30,393
<font color="yellow">Ma Chung-ja, how can you leave first?</font>

565
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,742
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. See you later!</font>

566
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:36,608
<font color="yellow">Does her daughter-in-law
hold a sword over her head?</font>

567
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:39,383
<font color="yellow">She did this the last time, too.
Why does she follow all her orders?</font>

568
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:41,279
<font color="yellow">She's not just any daughter-in-law.</font>

569
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:44,734
<font color="yellow">She's a daughter-in-law who buys
diamond necklaces and</font>

570
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:48,387
<font color="yellow">has 100 billion dollars- no. More than that.
She's the heiress of Winner's Group.</font>

571
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,827
<font color="yellow">That doesn't mean Geum-sil
has to be so intimidated by her!</font>

572
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,742
<font color="yellow">Who cares if she's the heiress of
Winner's Group? My goodness.</font>

573
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:57,641
<font color="yellow">Or did something happen at home?</font>

574
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:03,937
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

575
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:12,281
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, it's not this place either?</font>

576
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:15,164
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

577
00:39:15,922 --> 00:39:17,322
<font color="yellow">It's not here either.</font>

578
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:20,812
<font color="yellow">Really? Then let's go home for today.</font>

579
00:39:21,508 --> 00:39:23,633
<font color="yellow">You're going to catch a cold at this rate.</font>

580
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:25,399
<font color="yellow">Okay, father.</font>

581
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:26,570
<font color="yellow">Let's go then.</font>

582
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:47,562
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness they came
to the wrong place today.</font>

583
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:52,648
<font color="yellow">But we can't tail them forever
like this. This won't do.</font>

584
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:54,172
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

585
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:59,094
<font color="yellow">What will we do if they come
across Mi-poong's dumpling diner?</font>

586
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:02,528
<font color="yellow">So we need to block them before they do.</font>

587
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:04,029
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

588
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:06,192
<font color="yellow">Is there a way?</font>

589
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:12,182
<font color="yellow">We can just buy the building where
Mi-poong's dumpling diner is.</font>

590
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:18,869

594

<font color="yellow">Ma'am, don't be like this. Just sell it.</font>

<font color="yellow">We'll give you a good price for it.</font>

<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

600
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:58,262
<font color="yellow">It's not just a small store. It's a building.</font>

601

<font color="yellow">She wouldn't make a decision right away.</font>

602

hard-to-get to get more money?</font>

620
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:16,930

he do something like this?</font>

after you left to the court like that?</font>

627

<font color="yellow">I wondered if you two were going
to end up getting a divorce after all.</font>

628
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,614
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to get a divorce.</font>

suggestions, so I'm going to put these up.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Okay. Pose for me.
- Okay.</font>

638
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:46,650

639
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,415

- One more.</font>

- Next!</font>

642

<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, I'm going to answer this call.</font>

647
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,978
<font color="yellow">Why would you answer it outside?
Answer it here!</font>

648
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,780
<font color="yellow">What kind of call is that?</font>

649
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,420
<font color="yellow">I'm going to upload these photos!</font>

650

<font color="yellow">Joo-ri didn't remarry
her ex-husband that time?</font>

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

653
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:36,923
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

654
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:42,315
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

655
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:48,795
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, it hasn't been long since we started</font>

656
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,054
<font color="yellow">this business, but it's going so well...</font>

657
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,170
<font color="yellow">that I'm honestly getting scared.</font>

658
00:44:54,674 --> 00:44:55,674
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom.</font>

659
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:58,220
<font color="yellow">It's good if business go well.
Why would you be scared?</font>

660
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,966
<font color="yellow">And I heard the customers
talking about how the other stores</font>

661
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:05,373
<font color="yellow">are talking about how
delicious our dumplings are.</font>

662
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:06,822
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

663
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:09,103
<font color="yellow">This is great!</font>

664
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:12,822
<font color="yellow">What if we become really rich at this rate?</font>

665
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:17,471
<font color="yellow">Mom, since we're not busy anymore,
I'm going to go see Jang-go.</font>

666
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:21,145
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated that he didn't
come to the court today.</font>

667
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,095
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm here.</font>

668
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,189
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Jang-go.
- Hi.</font>

669
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:30,142
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

670
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,368
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I didn't come out today.</font>

671
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:36,119
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm sorry for worrying you.</font>

672
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,404
<font color="yellow">I'll explain everything.
Please sit down. Mi-poong, sit down.</font>

673
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,608
<font color="yellow">How can you do that?</font>

674
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,197
<font color="yellow">You should have come out.
You kept me waiting in the cold.</font>

675
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,702
<font color="yellow">Is divorce a joke?</font>

676
00:45:56,525 --> 00:46:00,580
<font color="yellow">Just like you said, divorce isn't a joke.
That's why I didn't come out.</font>

677
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:02,431
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

678
00:46:03,486 --> 00:46:05,515
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for making you wait in the cold.</font>

679
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:08,204
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not coming out either.</font>

680
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,369
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

681
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:15,389
<font color="yellow">I never had the intention of divorcing
Mi-poong from the beginning, mother.</font>

682
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:18,111
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

683
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,146
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, why are you doing this?</font>

684
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:24,156
<font color="yellow">I still love Mi-poong.</font>

685
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,767
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong loves me, too.</font>

686
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:34,892
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

687
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:38,658
<font color="yellow">I'm not divorcing you because I hate you.</font>

688
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,096
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

689
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:43,779
<font color="yellow">I know why you wanted a divorce, too.</font>

690
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,666
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong...</font>

691
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:52,290
<font color="yellow">we love each other,
so there must be another way.</font>

692
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:55,243
<font color="yellow">Jang-go-</font>

693
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:00,017
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

694
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:05,798
<font color="yellow">please trust me and help us start over again.</font>

695
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:10,478
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's think
about this a little longer.</font>

696
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:15,454
<font color="yellow">We love each other.
I don't think this is the answer.</font>

697
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
<font color="yellow">This isn't it.</font>

698
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:32,107
<font color="yellow">I said everything I wanted to say.</font>

699
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:34,108
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

700
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:47,047
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

701
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:50,721
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

702
00:47:51,556 --> 00:47:55,158
<font color="yellow">let's just think about this a little longer.</font>

703
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:57,158
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

704
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,555
<font color="yellow">Mom, let's take the dumplings
and go out to find father.</font>

705
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:06,897
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's do that.</font>

706
00:48:46,642 --> 00:48:51,829
<font color="yellow">Are you grilling expensive rib eye because
you're happy Jang-go got a divorce?</font>

707
00:48:52,236 --> 00:48:55,161
<font color="yellow">I'm grilling meat to lift up
his mood when he comes home.</font>

708
00:48:55,903 --> 00:48:58,001
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I care about his feelings?</font>

709
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:02,633
<font color="yellow">I see. Then grill a lot.</font>

710
00:49:02,822 --> 00:49:05,803
<font color="yellow">Jang-go didn't get a divorce,
so he'll have a big appetite.</font>

711
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:10,096
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? What do you
mean he didn't get a divorce?</font>

712
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:11,943
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

713
00:49:12,137 --> 00:49:15,509
<font color="yellow">He went to the court this morning to get
a divorce, so why didn't he get a divorce?</font>

714
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:17,806
<font color="yellow">Mother, don't even joke like that.</font>

715
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,642
<font color="yellow">Why would I make such a joke? My goodness.</font>

716
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,892
<font color="yellow">It's delicious! Eat up!</font>

717
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,322
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.</font>

718
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,415
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

719
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:37,533
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go.</font>

720
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:42,822
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

721
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:46,135
<font color="yellow">I heard you didn't get a divorce.
Is that true?</font>

722
00:49:47,408 --> 00:49:50,075
<font color="yellow">It's not. It's not true, right, Jang-go?</font>

723
00:49:50,236 --> 00:49:51,827
<font color="yellow">Your grandma was mistaken, wasn't she?</font>

724
00:49:52,846 --> 00:49:55,207
<font color="yellow">She's right. I didn't get a divorce.</font>

725
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,120
<font color="yellow">Why not? Why didn't you get a divorce?</font>

726
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:02,399
<font color="yellow">Did Mi-poong say she couldn't get the divorce?
Did she say she wouldn't let you go?</font>

727
00:50:02,736 --> 00:50:04,469
<font color="yellow">- Why I ought to...
- Mom!</font>

728
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,634
<font color="yellow">I didn't go to the court.
Mi-poong went. I didn't.</font>

729
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:11,095
<font color="yellow">Why not? Why didn't you go?</font>

730
00:50:11,611 --> 00:50:13,197
<font color="yellow">Because I don't want to get a divorce.</font>

731
00:50:14,736 --> 00:50:15,736
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

732
00:50:16,142 --> 00:50:20,040
<font color="yellow">I already went to Mi-poong and
told her I couldn't divorce her.</font>

733
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:22,925
<font color="yellow">And I begged her to change her mind.</font>

734
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,315
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to divorce
Mi-poong, so just know that.</font>

735
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:32,397
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh!
- You idiot!</font>

736
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:35,939
<font color="yellow">Why can't you divorce her?
What's so good about her?</font>

737
00:50:36,627 --> 00:50:39,978
<font color="yellow">So are you going to live
with that thief again?</font>

738
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:44,454
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to
tell you she was falsely accused?</font>

739
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:47,663
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!
What do you think you're doing?</font>

740
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:50,978
<font color="yellow">How dare you throw water
at the eldest son of our family!</font>

741
00:50:51,003 --> 00:50:55,004
<font color="yellow">- Do you want a taste of this?
- Mom, stop it!</font>

742
00:50:55,244 --> 00:51:00,160
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm going to wait until
Mi-poong changes her mind.</font>

743
00:51:00,939 --> 00:51:02,311
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to get a divorce.</font>

744
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:04,249
<font color="yellow">Keep that in mind.</font>

745
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:10,189
<font color="yellow">You can never be with her!
Never! Just grow old alone!</font>

746
00:51:10,892 --> 00:51:13,381
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, you should just give up.</font>

747
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:15,220
<font color="yellow">They can't get a divorce.</font>

748
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:19,130
<font color="yellow">How could they get divorced when they
went to have fun at a sledding resort?</font>

749
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,647
<font color="yellow">Sledding resort?</font>

750
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:25,119
<font color="yellow">- I can never forgive her!
- Mom!</font>

751
00:51:25,144 --> 00:51:27,544
<font color="yellow">- Let's go to your room.
- How could this happen?</font>

752
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:30,822
<font color="yellow">How could he do this to me? That jerk!</font>

753
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:35,643
<font color="yellow">What did you bring up the sledding resort for?</font>

754
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:39,079
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to get her to give up
and it just came out of my mouth...</font>

755
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,503
<font color="yellow">What are you doing not sleeping at this hour?</font>

756
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:58,898
<font color="yellow">I just couldn't sleep.</font>

757
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:11,000
<font color="yellow">Mom, go back in and sleep.</font>

758
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:14,806
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you need to make up your mind.</font>

759
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:18,783
<font color="yellow">Accept Jang-go's heart.</font>

760
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:23,281
<font color="yellow">Mom, to be honest...</font>

761
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:28,853
<font color="yellow">I was scared that Jang-go
would come to the court today.</font>

762
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:37,085
<font color="yellow">That's why I had hoped and
prayed that he wouldn't come.</font>

763
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:43,127
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

764
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,150
<font color="yellow">Sweetie.</font>

765
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:52,350
<font color="yellow">I want to accept his heart, but
I really don't know what I should do.</font>

766
00:52:54,424 --> 00:53:01,056
<font color="yellow">Should I just live with Jang-go whether
he cuts off ties with his mother or not?</font>

767
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:06,885
<font color="yellow">I really want to do that...</font>

768
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,911
<font color="yellow">but I shouldn't, mom.</font>

769
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:17,806
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, just like Jang-go had said,</font>

770
00:53:18,924 --> 00:53:20,402
<font color="yellow">let's just wait a little bit longer.</font>

771
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,970
<font color="yellow">Then some kind of solution will appear.</font>

772
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:25,736
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

773
00:53:26,822 --> 00:53:29,408
<font color="yellow">While we sell dumplings and search for father,</font>

774
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:32,814
<font color="yellow">we'll be able to find a solution, won't we?</font>

775
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:35,533
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

776
00:53:41,744 --> 00:53:45,250
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it together.
- Go in and sleep.</font>

777
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,596
<font color="yellow">No, I can't sleep either.</font>

778
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:50,968
<font color="yellow">(Father's Dumplings)</font>

779
00:53:57,056 --> 00:53:58,056
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

780
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,793
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, mother?</font>

781
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:10,780
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me because you don't know?</font>

782
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:13,642
<font color="yellow">If you said you were going
to divorce him, you should!</font>

783
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,321
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you letting Jang-go go?</font>

784
00:54:15,783 --> 00:54:20,185
<font color="yellow">You seduced Jang-go into getting you this store!
What more do you want from him?</font>

785
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,080
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want?</font>

786
00:54:24,743 --> 00:54:27,609
<font color="yellow">If there's something you want, tell me.</font>

787
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:30,299
<font color="yellow">Don't go behind my back
and ask my son for it. Tell me!</font>

788
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:31,324
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

789
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:34,040
<font color="yellow">I was going to divorce him
like you wanted me to.</font>

790
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:36,835
<font color="yellow">That's why I went to
the court yesterday after the</font>

791
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,033
<font color="yellow">consideration period was
over to finalize the divorce!</font>

792
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:41,886
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go didn't come out!
He said he didn't want to get a divorce!</font>

793
00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:44,127
<font color="yellow">So why are you doing this to me?</font>

794
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,457
<font color="yellow">What more do you want from me?</font>

795
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,708
<font color="yellow">If you really want us to get a divorce,
then you should change his mind.</font>

796
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,947
<font color="yellow">Then I'll do it.</font>

797
00:54:56,983 --> 00:55:00,714
<font color="yellow">What? Where do you get your courage from?</font>

798
00:55:01,694 --> 00:55:02,694
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

799
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:06,139
<font color="yellow">I married Jang-go because I liked him.</font>

800
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:11,009
<font color="yellow">Do you think it would have been
easy for me to decide to divorce him?</font>

801
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,886
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me to push Jang-go away now.</font>

802
00:55:17,843 --> 00:55:21,803
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see. Now your
true colors are coming out.</font>

803
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,850
<font color="yellow">This must be how you're
trying to hold him back.</font>

804
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,954
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll just watch that happen?</font>

805
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:34,975
<font color="yellow">Nothing will happen the way you want.</font>

806
00:55:35,194 --> 00:55:39,114
<font color="yellow">So it would be a good idea for you to give up.</font>

807
00:56:01,429 --> 00:56:05,286
<font color="yellow">- Welcome!
- I saw the styles recommended for gifts.</font>

808
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:07,778
<font color="yellow">- Oh, those?
- Do you have this coat?</font>

809
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:12,609
<font color="yellow">- Of course I do. Right this way.
- Okay.</font>

810
00:56:12,905 --> 00:56:14,073
<font color="yellow">It's right over there.</font>

811
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:19,530
<font color="yellow">- It's this navy one, right?
- Yes.</font>

812
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:24,022
<font color="yellow">- I took the picture and
uploaded it myself. Do you like it?
- Yes.</font>

813
00:56:25,772 --> 00:56:26,893
<font color="yellow">Where's the hair salon?</font>

814
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:29,178
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know that place.</font>

815
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,255
<font color="yellow">- I coordinated this outfit. Do you like it?
- Oh, you did?</font>

816
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,475
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks.</font>

817
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:39,584
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. Bye.
- Bye.</font>

818
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,030
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

819
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,877
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, I have plans, so I need to go.</font>

820
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:45,288
<font color="yellow">What plans?</font>

821
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:48,131
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to clean the store today.</font>

822
00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:50,350
<font color="yellow">Who will clean if you're not here?</font>

823
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:52,264
<font color="yellow">I'll clean when I come back!</font>

824
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:56,675
<font color="yellow">Why would he be busy when he's unemployed?</font>

825
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:10,749
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo?</font>

826
00:57:14,593 --> 00:57:15,993
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

827
00:57:16,647 --> 00:57:19,202
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to see me?</font>

828
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:21,601
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

829
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:24,714
<font color="yellow">What reason do we have to meet?</font>

830
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:28,080
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri, why did you lie to me?</font>

831
00:57:30,326 --> 00:57:31,326
<font color="yellow">What lie?</font>

832
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:35,378
<font color="yellow">You lied about getting back
together with your husband.</font>

833
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,255
<font color="yellow">Why is that important now?</font>

834
00:57:39,507 --> 00:57:41,827
<font color="yellow">I heard you lied for me.</font>

835
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:45,694
<font color="yellow">Why is it important if it's
the lie or the truth right now?</font>

836
00:57:47,257 --> 00:57:50,670
<font color="yellow">You're happy right now.
Didn't it work out then?</font>

837
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:53,353
<font color="yellow">Then you should be happy, too.
What's wrong with you?</font>

838
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:55,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so annoying?</font>

839
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:59,626
<font color="yellow">Don't mind me, and just be happy.</font>

840
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:23,588
<font color="yellow">So cute.</font>

841
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:33,283
<font color="yellow">Dad, Mr. Lee made a frog.</font>

842
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,918
<font color="yellow">Why did you come again?</font>

843
00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:39,517
<font color="yellow">I just stopped by while I was passing by.</font>

844
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,577
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

845
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:48,910
<font color="yellow">Soo-jung, I'll come again next time.</font>

846
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:50,963
<font color="yellow">Have fun.</font>

847
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:04,218
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, why are you exhausting me like this?</font>

848
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:07,238
<font color="yellow">Please don't come here.</font>

849
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,849
<font color="yellow">I'm not someone who could be of help to you.</font>

850
00:59:13,557 --> 00:59:18,580
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang, I'm begging you
to confess the truth.</font>

851
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,712
<font color="yellow">Then I'll never forget your kindness.</font>

852
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,551
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

853
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:28,092
<font color="yellow">Just tell me who was behind the box incident.</font>

854
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:34,447
<font color="yellow">After that box incident, my wife
was falsely accused and unfairly fired.</font>

855
00:59:35,127 --> 00:59:37,619
<font color="yellow">After that, she was forced
into an unwanted divorce with me.</font>

856
00:59:37,853 --> 00:59:42,798
<font color="yellow">Imagine you were unjustly fired
and your family was destroyed.</font>

857
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:46,105
<font color="yellow">I already told you I was the one who caused</font>

858
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,662
<font color="yellow">the box incident because I needed the money!</font>

859
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,689
<font color="yellow">Please don't bother me anymore.</font>

860
00:59:51,814 --> 00:59:54,109
<font color="yellow">One woman's life is on
the line here, Mr. Kang.</font>

861
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:58,759
<font color="yellow">Please reconsider. I'm begging you.</font>

862
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,025
<font color="yellow">I'll come see you again next time.</font>

863
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,758
<font color="yellow">What does he want now?</font>

864
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,760
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

865
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:08,890
<font color="yellow">I called you because I have a favor.</font>

866
01:01:10,346 --> 01:01:11,346
<font color="yellow">A favor?</font>

867
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:15,001
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee Jang-go keeps
showing up at my daughter's</font>

868
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:17,979
<font color="yellow">hospital and bothering me.
It's driving me nuts.</font>

869
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:20,307
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee Jang-go?</font>

870
01:01:22,494 --> 01:01:24,827
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll see you there then.</font>

871
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:35,593
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Is that true?</font>

872
01:01:36,002 --> 01:01:38,876
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please take care of it for me.</font>

873
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,595
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

874
01:01:58,111 --> 01:01:59,686
<font color="yellow">That Lee Jang-go...</font>

875
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,225
<font color="yellow">He's annoying.</font>

876
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:07,595
<font color="yellow">Take this and transfer
to a different hospital.</font>

877
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,405
<font color="yellow">It should be enough. And move
to the provinces while you're at it.</font>

878
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:13,380
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- If Lee Jang-go comes to see you again, make</font>

879
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:16,237
<font color="yellow">sure you make it clear to him
so that he can't come again.</font>

880
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:17,462
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

881
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,179
<font color="yellow">Why did Mr. Kang meet Mr. Heo?</font>

882
01:02:33,046 --> 01:02:34,513
<font color="yellow">Something is going on.</font>

883
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,100
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang!</font>

884
01:02:52,757 --> 01:02:53,757
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

885
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:56,002
<font color="yellow">Why did you get money from Mr. Heo?</font>

886
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:59,361
<font color="yellow">Whether I get money from someone
or not, it has nothing to do with you!</font>

887
01:03:01,061 --> 01:03:02,608
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang!</font>

888
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:08,389
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo...</font>

889
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:15,514
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo.</font>

890
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,210
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Lee.</font>

891
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:20,428
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

892
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,699
<font color="yellow">I saw you meeting Mr. Kang earlier.</font>

893
01:03:27,444 --> 01:03:29,491
<font color="yellow">You gave him money.</font>

894
01:03:31,093 --> 01:03:32,382
<font color="yellow">Why did you give it to him?</font>

895
01:03:33,694 --> 01:03:36,309
<font color="yellow">I heard his daughter is going to get surgery,</font>

896
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,608
<font color="yellow">so I thought I could be of some help to him.</font>

897
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:41,350
<font color="yellow">Did that answer your question?</font>

898
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:47,358
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo, Mr. Kang was fired from
Winner's Group for stealing the products.</font>

899
01:03:48,561 --> 01:03:51,519
<font color="yellow">But you're using his sick child
as an excuse to give him money</font>

900
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:54,501
<font color="yellow">when you're one of the
directors of Winner's Group?</font>

901
01:03:56,585 --> 01:03:58,080
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to believe that?</font>

902
01:04:01,069 --> 01:04:02,359
<font color="yellow">Look here, Mr. Lee.</font>

903
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:06,014
<font color="yellow">I'm using my money to help a person in need.</font>

904
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:07,897
<font color="yellow">Is that a problem?</font>

905
01:04:11,616 --> 01:04:12,616
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

906
01:04:13,452 --> 01:04:15,358
<font color="yellow">Are you doing a background check on me?</font>

907
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:19,501
<font color="yellow">Winner's Group hired you to do work here at</font>

908
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:23,381
<font color="yellow">Winner's Group, not do
a background check on me.</font>

909
01:04:24,022 --> 01:04:26,605
<font color="yellow">I can never forgive you
if you do something like this again.</font>

910
01:04:39,248 --> 01:04:40,555
<font color="yellow">There's something going on.</font>

911
01:04:42,593 --> 01:04:43,726
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

912
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:47,248
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee saw you give money to Mr. Kang?</font>

913
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:48,896
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

914
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,129
<font color="yellow">However, I made sure to keep
Mr. Kang's mouth shut, so there</font>

915
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:54,881
<font color="yellow">shouldn't be any problems. So don't worry.</font>

916
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:57,029
<font color="yellow">You said Mr. Lee saw you!</font>

917
01:04:57,256 --> 01:05:00,041
<font color="yellow">I told Mr. Lee I gave it to
Mr. Kang for his sick child, so</font>

918
01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:02,664
<font color="yellow">as long as Mr. Kang keeps
his mouth shut, it'll be fine.</font>

919
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:11,209
<font color="yellow">Isn't there a way to get rid of Mr. Lee?</font>

920
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:15,162
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll try to come up with a way.</font>

921
01:05:37,577 --> 01:05:40,671
<font color="yellow">What happened to buying the building
where the dumpling diner is at?</font>

922
01:05:41,093 --> 01:05:42,381
<font color="yellow">Did you call the owner?</font>

923
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:46,273
<font color="yellow">She said she won't sell it.</font>

924
01:05:47,054 --> 01:05:49,795
<font color="yellow">Even if we were going to give her
a hundred thousand dollars more?</font>

925
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,820
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

926
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:54,662
<font color="yellow">We were going to give her more than
the original price, so why won't she sell it?</font>

927
01:05:55,405 --> 01:05:56,405
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

928
01:05:57,343 --> 01:05:58,353
<font color="yellow">She's going to sell it.</font>

929
01:05:59,241 --> 01:06:02,138
<font color="yellow">If she won't take $100,000,
we'll raise it to $300,000.</font>

930
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:05,117
<font color="yellow">If she still won't sell it,
we'll raise it to $500,000.</font>

931
01:06:05,772 --> 01:06:10,485
<font color="yellow">Yes. We're going to give her so
much money. Why wouldn't she sell it?</font>

932
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:15,007
<font color="yellow">There's no one who doesn't
crumble in front of money.</font>

933
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,782
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, let's play slap-match here.</font>

934
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:32,732
<font color="yellow">If we play downstairs, it'll get tiring
because of that woman's nagging.</font>

935
01:06:33,475 --> 01:06:34,725
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr. Kim!</font>

936
01:06:35,796 --> 01:06:38,631
<font color="yellow">Okay then...</font>

937
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:42,798
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, four, five. Here you go.</font>

938
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:47,520
<font color="yellow">You get five. One, two,
three, four. And I get five.</font>

939
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:49,928
<font color="yellow">You can go first.</font>

940
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:54,913
<font color="yellow">Here I go.</font>

941
01:06:58,108 --> 01:07:02,012
<font color="yellow">What was that? The card unfolded!</font>

942
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:06,686
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what's this? How can
this happen on the first try?</font>

943
01:07:14,413 --> 01:07:16,272
<font color="yellow">(We are looking for a person)</font>

944
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,350
<font color="yellow">"We are looking for a person?"</font>

945
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,811
<font color="yellow">(Name: Kim Dae-hoon)</font>

946
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:29,037
<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon?</font>

947
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:56,426
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

948
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:59,616
<font color="yellow">Did you call yourself "mom" to Yoo-jin?</font>

949
01:08:00,397 --> 01:08:02,788
<font color="yellow">I think this paper is looking for me.</font>

950
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,215
<font color="yellow">- You're not my daughter, right?
- Should I lock you up?</font>

951
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,335
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell father everything!</font>

952
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,324
<font color="yellow">Honey! Are you really my husband?</font>

953
01:08:10,577 --> 01:08:12,441
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, can we meet?</font>

954
01:08:12,796 --> 01:08:16,201
<font color="yellow">- What is it now?
- I have a favor to ask of you. Please do it.</font>

955
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,226
<font color="yellow">Jang-go...</font>
