00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,301
<font color="yellow">That's the bus to the city. Run, Seung-hee! We have to get on that!</font>

4
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:17,099
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! He's so manly!</font>

5
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:57,866
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's so beautiful!</font>

6
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,527
<font color="yellow">Jang-go?</font>

7
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,619
<font color="yellow">What is it? Were you that touched by a headband?</font>

8
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:26,285
<font color="yellow">I think I'll have to marry you later on.</font>

9
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:29,610
<font color="yellow">What? You'll do what with me?</font>

10
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:36,011
<font color="yellow">Well, in my country, you have to marry the person who gives you a headband.</font>

11
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,248
<font color="yellow">That's the law of our country.</font>

12
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,083
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

13
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:44,855
<font color="yellow">Then I'll wear it.</font>

14
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,396
<font color="yellow">Now I don't have to marry you, right?</font>

15
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:50,344
<font color="yellow">How can you take back what you just gave me?</font>

16
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:54,255
<font color="yellow">That's a girl's headband!</font>

17
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,108
<font color="yellow">Give it to me!</font>

18
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:57,760
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you if you can catch me.</font>

19
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,272
<font color="yellow">Give it back to me!</font>

20
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:02,715
<font color="yellow">Give it back to me!</font>

21
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,172
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors!</font>

22
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:09,939
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors!</font>

23
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,582
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors!</font>

24
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:20,576
<font color="yellow">Rock, paper, scissors!</font>

25
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:31,866
<font color="yellow">Why can't you do it?</font>

26
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:39,097
<font color="yellow">Like this! How many times do I have to tell you to slide your feet like this?</font>

27
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:43,777
<font color="yellow">Yeah, like this.</font>

28
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:47,040
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you're a stupid pumpkin head!</font>

29
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:50,175
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'll show it to you properly.</font>

30
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,287
<font color="yellow">Watch carefully.</font>

31
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,561
<font color="yellow">Like this. Like this.</font>

32
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,211
<font color="yellow">Like this. Like this.</font>

33
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,070
<font color="yellow">What happens if...</font>

34
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:25,418
<font color="yellow">my friend's father-in-law passes away before his cousin does?</font>

35
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,429
<font color="yellow">Then I...</font>

36
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,938
<font color="yellow">I mean, my friend's family becomes distant relatives with his cousin.</font>

37
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:36,157
<font color="yellow">Then they can't receive the inheritance?</font>

38
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:39,876
<font color="yellow">In that case, they can still legally receive it.</font>

39
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,463
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be doing this right now.</font>

40
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:51,623
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

41
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,851
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra!</font>

42
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:25,919
<font color="yellow">My precious babies! I cheer up just looking at you two!</font>

43
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,388
<font color="yellow">Grandpa, have some porridge.</font>

44
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,190
<font color="yellow">You, too, grandpa.</font>

45
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:37,443
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's delicious!</font>

46
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,389
<font color="yellow">Grandpa, have one more bite.</font>

47
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,125
<font color="yellow">Oh, that sly fox!</font>

48
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:46,891
<font color="yellow">Good job, sweetie!</font>

49
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:48,938
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

50
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,615
<font color="yellow">It's delicious!</font>

51
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,568
<font color="yellow">You're such a good dancer!</font>

52
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:57,442
<font color="yellow">Good job, Hee-dong!</font>

53
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,393
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

54
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:01,761
<font color="yellow">Here's five dollars.</font>

55
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:03,505
<font color="yellow">Thank you, mom.</font>

56
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,385
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go home and study.</font>

57
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,371
<font color="yellow">Okay, sweetie! Do your best!</font>

58
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:13,662
<font color="yellow">Do you best!</font>

59
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:17,462
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

60
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:19,284
<font color="yellow">You did a good job, too.</font>

61
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:26,686
<font color="yellow">I'll give you ten dollars for being very cute!</font>

62
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,729
<font color="yellow">Mom, this wasn't what you promised.</font>

63
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:34,907
<font color="yellow">Come on. Your brother was happy with five dollars.</font>

64
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,450
<font color="yellow">I don't have much money lately.</font>

65
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,238
<font color="yellow">You don't have money when you go to those expensive</font>

66
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:42,292
<font color="yellow">plastic surgery hospitals and dermatology clinics?</font>

67
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:46,610
<font color="yellow">And if you keep breaking your promise like this, I can never do this for you again.</font>

68
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,209
<font color="yellow">I have to be able to trust you.</font>

69
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,531
<font color="yellow">You annoying brat!</font>

70
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:53,182
<font color="yellow">I wish I could just hit her once!</font>

71
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,389
<font color="yellow">Why? You want to hit me just once?</font>

72
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,437
<font color="yellow">Why would I want to hit my pretty daughter?</font>

73
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,225
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

74
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,468
<font color="yellow">The fifty dollars I promised.</font>

75
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,847
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go watch a music program with my friend. I'll be late.</font>

76
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,798
<font color="yellow">-You better not be!
- Cheer up!</font>

77
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:14,943
<font color="yellow">That little brat!</font>

78
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:20,837
<font color="yellow">Did our twins leave?</font>

79
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:21,841
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

80
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,179
<font color="yellow">Honey, look at this.</font>

81
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,973
<font color="yellow">Elder finished his porridge. So did father.</font>

82
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,800
<font color="yellow">You saved them both.</font>

83
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,514
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You're the best!</font>

84
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,458
<font color="yellow">Did you just realize that?</font>

85
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,850
<font color="yellow">And Elder said he would help us out again. Everything is solved!</font>

86
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,592
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

87
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,044
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

88
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,164
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to you!</font>

89
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:50,643
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was so scared that something might happen to them!</font>

90
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,311
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

91
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:58,991
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'll make sure nothing bad ever happens to father!</font>

92
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:05,377
<font color="yellow">I'm going to think of your father as mine and</font>

93
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:11,701
<font color="yellow">do my very best to make sure he lives a long and happy life!</font>

94
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,428
<font color="yellow">So don't worry!</font>

95
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,145
<font color="yellow">-Chung-ja.
- Dal-ho!</font>

96
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:26,854
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, honey, you need to live with me forever, okay?</font>

97
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

98
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:33,225
<font color="yellow">-Yes, well...-Dal-ho!</font>

99
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,912
<font color="yellow">I love you!</font>

100
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:57,975
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

101
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,730
<font color="yellow">Why is my heart beating so fast?</font>

102
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,824
<font color="yellow">I'm sitting right next to Jang-go. I might get caught.</font>

103
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:10,951
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Stop thumping!</font>

104
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:13,606
<font color="yellow">A girl should have some pride!</font>

105
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:17,237
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee, you idiot!</font>

106
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,040
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you sick?</font>

107
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:22,943
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not sick.</font>

108
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,063
<font color="yellow">Why are you staring at me like that?</font>

109
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:32,287
<font color="yellow">You're not sick, but why do you look like you just ate poop?</font>

110
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:35,095
<font color="yellow">Poop?</font>

111
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,157
<font color="yellow">I ate poop?</font>

112
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:38,851
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

113
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,079
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to a woman?</font>

114
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:44,264
<font color="yellow">Forget it then.</font>

115
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,185
<font color="yellow">And what? A woman?</font>

116
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:50,793
<font color="yellow">You're not a woman. You're a tadpole.</font>

117
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,750
<font color="yellow">Then am I a man?</font>

118
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:58,209
<font color="yellow">Fine. You're a woman. Happy?</font>

119
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:06,071
<font color="yellow">That's right. Now I know.</font>

120
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:11,487
<font color="yellow">My heart is thumping because I like Jang-go.</font>

121
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,743
<font color="yellow">It's not a heart disease.</font>

122
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:19,262
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Jang-go's heart beats like this, too, when he looks at me.</font>

123
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:23,621
<font color="yellow">Then that means he likes me.</font>

124
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:25,589
<font color="yellow">I can't even ask him.</font>

125
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,506
<font color="yellow">Oh! I know who I can ask!</font>

126
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:34,475
<font color="yellow">There's a story about that music room.</font>

127
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:38,930
<font color="yellow">If two people who are not destined to be together are inside the music room,</font>

128
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,496
<font color="yellow">a ghost appears at exactly 9 o'clock to harass them.</font>

129
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,570
<font color="yellow">Then what happens if there are two people who are in true love?</font>

130
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,918
<font color="yellow">You'll hear music with fantastic melody.</font>

131
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:56,912
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll have to find out if Jang-go likes me, too.</font>

132
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:00,099
<font color="yellow">If Jang-go likes me, too,</font>

133
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,701
<font color="yellow">I'll be able to hear a melody that he's the boy fated to be with me.</font>

134
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:09,382
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? We still have a long way to go.</font>

135
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,326
<font color="yellow">I'm in big trouble! I left something important at school!</font>

136
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,887
<font color="yellow">I have to go back to school!</font>

137
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,533
<font color="yellow">School? At this time?</font>

138
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:20,061
<font color="yellow">It'll be getting dark soon.</font>

139
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:23,703
<font color="yellow">That's why you have to come with me.</font>

140
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:25,226
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

141
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,368
<font color="yellow">What on earth did you come to find here?</font>

142
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:12,394
<font color="yellow">I left an accessory for a a dress that I'll have to wear for the school festival.</font>

143
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:15,655
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and find it. It'll be getting dark soon.</font>

144
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,666
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

145
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,541
<font color="yellow">Where did I put it?</font>

146
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:55,560
<font color="yellow">Mother, what did the teacher say?</font>

147
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,199
<font color="yellow">There was no group studying today.</font>

148
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,641
<font color="yellow">Then Seung-hee lied to me?</font>

149
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,340
<font color="yellow">She told me she would be going to a group study.</font>

150
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:08,142
<font color="yellow">Nothing would have happened to her, right?</font>

151
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:11,599
<font color="yellow">Of course not. If something had happened, we would have gotten a call.</font>

152
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,579
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll go look for her.</font>

153
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,071
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Jang-go coming home?</font>

154
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:32,643
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

155
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,388
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

156
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,572
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous.</font>

157
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,464
<font color="yellow">That's why I said you should buy us cell-phones.</font>

158
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:41,541
<font color="yellow">A call would do the trick.</font>

159
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,653
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

160
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,407
<font color="yellow">Don't even dream of having a cell-phone.</font>

161
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:50,498
<font color="yellow">Jang-go has never been this late without telling us before.</font>

162
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,199
<font color="yellow">You still haven't found it?</font>

163
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:01,238
<font color="yellow">Maybe you left it somewhere else.</font>

164
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,857
<font color="yellow">No, I really left it here.</font>

165
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,715
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. It's not here either.</font>

166
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:10,895
<font color="yellow">Is it over there?</font>

167
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:19,174
<font color="yellow">You already looked over there.</font>

168
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:21,942
<font color="yellow">Why are you in such a rush?</font>

169
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:25,207
<font color="yellow">We still have a lot of time. I'll take my time.</font>

170
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,639
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's over there.</font>

171
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:51,666
<font color="yellow">Yes! It's finally nine o'clock! The fateful time has come!</font>

172
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:56,192
<font color="yellow">But why can't I hear anything?</font>

173
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,062
<font color="yellow">What's this? Then is Jang-go not meant to be with me?</font>

174
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,723
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

175
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,147
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! Jang-go! Jang-go!</font>

176
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,154
<font color="yellow">It's a ghost. It's a ghost!</font>

177
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,350
<font color="yellow">It's me! Are you all right?</font>

178
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,680
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, there's a ghost!</font>

179
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:36,015
<font color="yellow">It's me! It's not a ghost! It's me, Lee Jang-go!</font>

180
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,755
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

181
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:42,763
<font color="yellow">Jang-go?</font>

182
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,961
<font color="yellow">Did you wear a ghost mask?</font>

183
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,151
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a real ghost?</font>

184
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:49,368
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Were you that scared?</font>

185
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:52,817
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

186
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:56,003
<font color="yellow">I really thought you were a ghost!</font>

187
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:57,504
<font color="yellow">I hate you, fish boy!</font>

188
00:14:58,787 --> 00:14:59,787
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

189
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:03,862
<font color="yellow">But Kim Seung-hee, tell me the truth.</font>

190
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:07,138
<font color="yellow">You didn't come here to find something, did you?</font>

191
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:12,933
<font color="yellow">Then did you come here to check the legend?</font>

192
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,322
<font color="yellow">Well, the thing is...</font>

193
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:20,707
<font color="yellow">I wanted to check if we were meant to be.</font>

194
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,989
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

195
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,188
<font color="yellow">What do I do with a little tadpole like you?</font>

196
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,794
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you think this makes sense?</font>

197
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,666
<font color="yellow">My friends told me it would work!</font>

198
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:39,582
<font color="yellow">That's why you're a tadpole and not a woman.</font>

199
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,922
<font color="yellow">It's all a lie. Let's just go.</font>

200
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,367
<font color="yellow">Your family will be worried.</font>

201
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,931
<font color="yellow">I don't want to! I can't go!</font>

202
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,254
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to go until I hear music!</font>

203
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,148
<font color="yellow">Then you're going to spend the night here because of that superstition?</font>

204
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,239
<font color="yellow">Fine. You stay here by yourself.</font>

205
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,513
<font color="yellow">Don't look for me when a ghost appears.</font>

206
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:22,038
<font color="yellow">-It's a ghost!
- It's a ghost!</font>

207
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,248
<font color="yellow">Save us!</font>

208
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,727
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

209
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,554
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what do we do?</font>

210
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,127
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

211
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,948
<font color="yellow">It was open, so why is it locked?</font>

212
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:43,467
<font color="yellow">The ghost did it so it could eat us up!</font>

213
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,474
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

214
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:46,977
<font color="yellow">We're stuck in here!</font>

215
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:48,340
<font color="yellow">Open the door!</font>

216
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:52,408
<font color="yellow">But wasn't that the melody of fate?</font>

217
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,058
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

218
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
<font color="yellow">That was-</font>

219
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:08,245
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

220
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,556
<font color="yellow">-We're stuck here! Open the door!
- There's a ghost here! Help!</font>

221
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:13,974
<font color="yellow">Open the door for us!</font>

222
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,415
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, we need to speak in English!</font>

223
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,229
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right!</font>

224
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:20,298
<font color="yellow">- We're inside!
-  Help!</font>

225
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:23,348
<font color="yellow">- Please help us!
-  Please open the door!</font>

226
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,076
<font color="yellow">We're inside!</font>

227
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,137
<font color="yellow">Help! Please help us!</font>

228
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,013
<font color="yellow">Please!</font>

229
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,270
<font color="yellow">Open the door! We're inside!</font>

230
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,357
<font color="yellow">Your father isn't even here. What do we do?</font>

231
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:53,307
<font color="yellow">Something definitely happened.</font>

232
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,220
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee never did this before.</font>

233
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,987
<font color="yellow">I talked to her friend Jessica who told me that Seung-hee said</font>

234
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:00,701
<font color="yellow">she had somewhere important to go to and left by herself.</font>

235
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:03,840
<font color="yellow">This won't do. I need to call the police.</font>

236
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:07,777
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

237
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,192
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

238
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,176
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee was where?</font>

239
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,215
<font color="yellow">The music room closet?</font>

240
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,895
<font color="yellow">She was in there with who?</font>

241
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:35,636
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you're old enough, so how could you fall for this little brat's trick?</font>

242
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,017
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

243
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:38,761
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

244
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:41,190
<font color="yellow">You're being too mean.</font>

245
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,135
<font color="yellow">I'm not!</font>

246
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:45,528
<font color="yellow">Do you know how shocked I was after getting the phone call?</font>

247
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,107
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

248
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,836
<font color="yellow">How would I know they would've locked the doors?</font>

249
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:55,706
<font color="yellow">You're being so audacious after you scared me.</font>

250
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:02,358
<font color="yellow">You little brat. I dare you to trick him like this again.</font>

251
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,957
<font color="yellow">Then you're going to get in trouble by me!</font>

252
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,008
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go.</font>

253
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,161
<font color="yellow">We have to wait until Seung-hee goes home.</font>

254
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:16,272
<font color="yellow">She'll go home on her own.</font>

255
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:18,522
<font color="yellow">Her mom said she would come pick her up.</font>

256
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:20,144
<font color="yellow">But still...</font>

257
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,714
<font color="yellow">how can we leave her alone here?</font>

258
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:27,434
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see her mother.</font>

259
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,464
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee!</font>

260
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,099
<font color="yellow">What do you think you are doing?</font>

261
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,609
<font color="yellow">Were you about to slap my son?</font>

262
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,175
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

263
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,315
<font color="yellow">Let go? Let go?</font>

264
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,409
<font color="yellow">What did you do to Seung-hee?</font>

265
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:54,408
<font color="yellow">How dare a young man like you act so indecently?</font>

266
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,340
<font color="yellow">You piece of garbage!</font>

267
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,371
<font color="yellow">You're a crazy woman.</font>

268
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:02,197
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to hurt my precious son?</font>

269
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,726
<font color="yellow">What? A piece of garbage?</font>

270
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:08,685
<font color="yellow">Were you saying that to my son?</font>

271
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:09,714
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

272
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:11,765
<font color="yellow">You piece of garbage!</font>

273
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,889
<font color="yellow">What did you do to Seung-hee?</font>

274
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,602
<font color="yellow">Mom! I was the one who asked him to come with me!</font>

275
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,853
<font color="yellow">Jang-go didn't do anything wrong!</font>

276
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,379
<font color="yellow">So why are you saying such rude things to him?</font>

277
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

278
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,972
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

279
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,045
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

280
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:33,604
<font color="yellow">Your daughter made my son come here because she has a crush on him!</font>

281
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,707
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

282
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,010
<font color="yellow">Tell your mom the truth!</font>

283
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,617
<font color="yellow">My friends said that you would be able to hear music if</font>

284
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:47,528
<font color="yellow">you're in the music storage room with your fateful partner!</font>

285
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:52,629
<font color="yellow">That's why I lied to Jang-go and brought him here.</font>

286
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:55,738
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

287
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,378
<font color="yellow">Hey, you should get hit, too.</font>

288
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:03,363
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

289
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,222
<font color="yellow">Mom, let's go! Let's go!</font>

290
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:11,245
<font color="yellow">Is hitting others all you people know how to do?</font>

291
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:13,628
<font color="yellow">Why did you try to hit my precious son?</font>

292
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:18,985
<font color="yellow">Stop showing off and educate your child properly, you obnoxious woman!</font>

293
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:24,057
<font color="yellow">What a devious little witch! How dare she try to seduce boys with lies!</font>

294
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,697
<font color="yellow">Mom, stop it! Let's go!</font>

295
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:34,037
<font color="yellow">-Let go of me! What's wrong with you? I have a lot to say!
- Let's go!</font>

296
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:41,585
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you again.</font>

297
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:45,413
<font color="yellow">Did you really ask him to go with you first?</font>

298
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,059
<font color="yellow">Yes. How many times must I tell you?</font>

299
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:55,258
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

300
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:59,122
<font color="yellow">No matter how immature you are, how can you be so fearless?</font>

301
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:02,398
<font color="yellow">What would you have done if he had tried to do terrible things to you?</font>

302
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:04,300
<font color="yellow">What terrible things?</font>

303
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,867
<font color="yellow">Jang-go isn't a terrible boy!</font>

304
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:10,874
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back to me! I dare you to do that again!</font>

305
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:14,177
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you met father when you were my age?</font>

306
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:18,521
<font color="yellow">You said you married father because you liked him ever since you were my age!</font>

307
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:22,059
<font color="yellow">But why can't you understand how I feel?</font>

308
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,771
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

309
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,820
<font color="yellow">I like Jang-go.</font>

310
00:22:28,732 --> 00:22:30,881
<font color="yellow">He's so cool, and I keep thinking about him.</font>

311
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,455
<font color="yellow">Is it wrong to like him?</font>

312
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:38,763
<font color="yellow">What? Hey! What did you just say?</font>

313
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:42,858
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say something like that again.</font>

314
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:46,062
<font color="yellow">How can you like a South Korean boy?</font>

315
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:49,488
<font color="yellow">If you say something like that again, I'll tell father</font>

316
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:52,272
<font color="yellow">to send you back to North Korea by yourself! Got it?</font>

317
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,023
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want!</font>

318
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,412
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

319
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,869
<font color="yellow">What will I do with you?</font>

320
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:26,748
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo.</font>

321
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:39,935
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo.</font>

322
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,631
<font color="yellow">I'm Mi-Jung.</font>

323
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,810
<font color="yellow">Kang Mi-Jung.</font>

324
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:48,521
<font color="yellow">Oh Bok-soon's daughter.</font>

325
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,715
<font color="yellow">How did you come here?</font>

326
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:54,778
<font color="yellow">What about your mother?</font>

327
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:56,912
<font color="yellow">My mother...</font>

328
00:23:58,263 --> 00:23:59,396
<font color="yellow">starved to death.</font>

329
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:02,271
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

330
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:07,288
<font color="yellow">My mother told me that I wouldn't starve to death if I go to you.</font>

331
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:11,129
<font color="yellow">She told me to live with you.</font>

332
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

333
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:42,485
<font color="yellow">She must have starved for days.</font>

334
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:46,443
<font color="yellow">Mother, is she really a kkotjebi?</font>

335
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,238
<font color="yellow">-(Kkotjebi: Homeless kids who go around looking for food.)
- A kkotjebi?</font>

336
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,557
<font color="yellow">Then she's a very pitiful girl.</font>

337
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:54,916
<font color="yellow">Quiet.</font>

338
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,525
<font color="yellow">My clothes fit you well.</font>

339
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,916
<font color="yellow">Mi-Jung, do you want to use this?</font>

340
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:35,932
<font color="yellow">If you need anything, just let me know. I'll help you with everything.</font>

341
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:53,808
<font color="yellow">I'm so angry!</font>

342
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:56,635
<font color="yellow">I should have hit that little brat on the head!</font>

343
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:01,715
<font color="yellow">I think I'll be too angry to sleep tonight!</font>

344
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:03,658
<font color="yellow">Mom, that's enough.</font>

345
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,982
<font color="yellow">Aren't you angry after suffering through that?</font>

346
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,642
<font color="yellow">If you think from Seung-hee's mom's point-of-view, she has a right</font>

347
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,507
<font color="yellow">to be angry. It was still my fault for sending her home late.</font>

348
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:13,759
<font color="yellow">Is that your fault?</font>

349
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,232
<font color="yellow">It's her fault!</font>

350
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,789
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

351
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:19,657
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's right. She can think that way since</font>

352
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:22,085
<font color="yellow">she's raising a daughter. It's different from us.</font>

353
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:26,801
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you not to be close with those North Korean kids!</font>

354
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:28,831
<font color="yellow">You told me to be friends with them.</font>

355
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:31,628
<font color="yellow">I told you to pretend you were friends! Not to</font>

356
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:33,937
<font color="yellow">stick around with them! This is why this happened!</font>

357
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,550
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't even act like you know them. Got it?</font>

358
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,996
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of that.</font>

359
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,334
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Where are you going at this hour?</font>

360
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:48,926
<font color="yellow">That's enough. Let him be.</font>

361
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,187
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

362
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:29,548
<font color="yellow">You're a thief! Thief!</font>

363
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,965
<font color="yellow">Thief!</font>

364
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,198
<font color="yellow">How dare you steal from us!</font>

365
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:42,464
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

366
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,250
<font color="yellow">I brought rice.</font>

367
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,049
<font color="yellow">Mom, wake up.</font>

368
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,296
<font color="yellow">Mom, wake up!</font>

369
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:57,276
<font color="yellow">Mom! Please wake up!</font>

370
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:02,636
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

371
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,651
<font color="yellow">At least eat this before you go.</font>

372
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,835
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's rice.</font>

373
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

374
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:14,683
<font color="yellow">Mi-Jung...</font>

375

376
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:21,948
<font color="yellow">if something happens to me,</font>

377
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:25,773
<font color="yellow">go find my friend Young-ae in Macau.</font>

378

379
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:37,926
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

380
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:39,585
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

381
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,623
<font color="yellow">Take a bite of this before you go!</font>

382
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,795
<font color="yellow">Mom, wake up!</font>

383
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,543
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

384
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,532
<font color="yellow">Mom, wake up!</font>

385
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:42,391
<font color="yellow">Right this instant?</font>

386
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,009
<font color="yellow">Why all of a sudden?</font>

387
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:45,951
<font color="yellow">Mother is in danger.</font>

388
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,319
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

389
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,475
<font color="yellow">I was commanded to return. Plans changed.</font>

390
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:56,881
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

391
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,840
<font color="yellow">How can this happen?</font>

392
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:08,701
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't I at least say good-bye to my friends?</font>

393
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:13,244
<font color="yellow">You and Yeong-cheol should go back to North Korea by yourselves!</font>

394
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:16,671
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

395
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:17,927
<font color="yellow">Then live here by yourself.</font>

396
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,704
<font color="yellow">Fine!</font>

397
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,755
<font color="yellow">I can live alone!</font>

398
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:49,930
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry we have to leave you here, but we have no choice.</font>

399

00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:58,447
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, I have nowhere else to go!</font>

401
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:00,513

409
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,595
<font color="yellow">You didn't come here to find something, did you?</font>

410
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:32,775
<font color="yellow">Fine. You stay here by yourself. Don't look for me when a ghost appears.</font>

411
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,721
<font color="yellow">-It's a ghost!
- It's a ghost!</font>

<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

413
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:47,735

414
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,888

419
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,497
<font color="yellow">No, what?</font>

420
00:33:20,294 --> 00:33:24,075
<font color="yellow">Yeong-cheol went back to Pyongyang. He dropped out of school.</font>

421
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,598
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

422
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,153

429
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:36,439
<font color="yellow">Mom, wait! I need to say good-bye to Jang-go!</font>

430
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:38,439
<font color="yellow">I said you to get in!</font>

431
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,998
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, we'll meet again!</font>

432
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,870
<font color="yellow">You heard that music in the room last night, right?</font>

433
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,215

01:02:58,226 --> 01:02:59,247
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

767
01:02:59,247 --> 01:03:00,423
<font color="yellow">Did she win the lottery?</font>

768
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,811
<font color="yellow">You didn't know about that?</font>

769
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:04,566
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

770
01:03:05,976 --> 01:03:07,234
<font color="yellow">It's not that kind of lottery.</font>

771
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:11,241
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't know about it because you didn't come out to our reunions.</font>

772
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:16,109
<font color="yellow">Don't get shocked. Chung-ja became the heiress of a 100 million dollars.</font>

773
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:20,429
<font color="yellow">What? A 100 million dollars?</font>

774
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:22,366
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

775
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,768
<font color="yellow">Kyung-sook! Hee-Jung! You came!</font>

776
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:26,968
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

777

<font color="yellow">It's good to see you!</font>

778
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:31,112
<font color="yellow">You got prettier!</font>

779
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:43,879
<font color="yellow">Welcome!</font>

780
01:03:45,202 --> 01:03:48,024
<font color="yellow">Oh, aren't you Geum-sil?</font>

781
01:03:48,843 --> 01:03:50,538
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chung-ja. It's nice to see you.</font>

782
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:52,065
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

783
01:03:52,843 --> 01:03:55,376
<font color="yellow">-It's good to see you, Geum-sil.

784
01:03:58,093 --> 01:03:59,226
<font color="yellow">There are guests.</font>

785
01:04:01,022 --> 01:04:02,905
<font color="yellow">This is my daughter, Hee-Ra.</font>

786
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:05,835
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

787
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,350
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

788
01:04:07,702 --> 01:04:08,702
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

789
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:11,304
<font color="yellow">I'm going out.</font>

790
01:04:12,085 --> 01:04:13,085
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

793
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:34,377
<font color="yellow">This is my husband, Jo Dal-ho.</font>

794
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:36,397
<font color="yellow">He's not acting as a single man, is he?</font>

795
01:05:36,397 --> 01:05:37,758
<font color="yellow">I want to marry Joo-ri.</font>

796
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:39,263
<font color="yellow">Aren't you over forty years old?</font>

797
01:05:39,263 --> 01:05:41,428
<font color="yellow">How dare you, you crazy bastard!</font>

798
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:42,457
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri!</font>

799
01:05:42,457 --> 01:05:44,298
<font color="yellow">This house will be auctioned now.</font>

800
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:46,498
<font color="yellow">This is our house under my name!</font>

801
01:05:46,498 --> 01:05:48,974
<font color="yellow">For how much longer will you call him Elder?</font>

802
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,252
<font color="yellow">Call him father. Father.</font>

803
01:05:51,252 --> 01:05:56,157
<font color="yellow">Are you worried that I'll spill the reason why you're being so good to that old man?</font>

804
01:05:56,157 --> 01:05:59,377
<font color="yellow">Please help me get my security deposit back.</font>
