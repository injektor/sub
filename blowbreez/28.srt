00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,993
<font color="yellow">What if one day, she appears
out of nowhere and</font>

4
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,643
<font color="yellow">declares that she's the real granddaughter?</font>

5
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:26,938
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared!</font>

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,382
<font color="yellow">What will happen then?</font>

7
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:36,960
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, you were so awesome today.</font>

8
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:44,122
<font color="yellow">All the board members looked at you with
trust and respect. It made me so proud!</font>

9
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:45,742
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

10
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,102
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,976
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, grandfather.</font>

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,930
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

13
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,809
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

14
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:07,374
<font color="yellow">Who's this? It's Kim Mi-poong!</font>

15
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,089
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

16
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:13,944
<font color="yellow">I work in the marketing team here.</font>

17
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:16,224
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

18
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:20,043
<font color="yellow">You're an employee of Winner's Group?</font>

19
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:24,888
<font color="yellow">She works in our company?</font>

20
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,716
<font color="yellow">Yes. But...</font>

21
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:30,693
<font color="yellow">It's been a while, Mi-poong.</font>

22
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,958
<font color="yellow">But how do you know my grandfather?</font>

23
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:36,748
<font color="yellow">Your grandfather?</font>

24
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,162
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

25
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:42,291
<font color="yellow">Do you two know each other?</font>

26
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,841
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is my granddaughter.</font>

27
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,305
<font color="yellow">She's my biological granddaughter
I found recently.</font>

28
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:52,161
<font color="yellow">Pardon? She's your granddaughter?</font>

29
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,771
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

30
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:58,722
<font color="yellow">But how do you two know each other?</font>

31
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:00,699
<font color="yellow">The thing is-</font>

32
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:04,383
<font color="yellow">We knew each other in Pyeongyang.</font>

33
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,169
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that so?</font>

34
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:08,856
<font color="yellow">No wonder!</font>

35
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:14,114
<font color="yellow">When I met you at Imjingak for the first time,
you didn't feel like a stranger at all.</font>

36
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,802
<font color="yellow">What a coincidence!</font>

37
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:21,177
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. But...</font>

38
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:24,520
<font color="yellow">See you later, Mi-poong.</font>

39
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:28,060
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather, let's go.
- Sure.</font>

40
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:32,212
<font color="yellow">See you again, Mi-poong.</font>

41
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,441
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

42
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:35,123
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

43
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,091
<font color="yellow">How can we run into each other here?</font>

44
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:50,099
<font color="yellow">Is that the Kang Mi-Jung I know?</font>

45
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:59,787
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's me. Did you know that Kang Mi-Jung
has a grandfather in South Korea?</font>

46
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:06,208
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? She has no family.</font>

47
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:09,847
<font color="yellow">She didn't have anyone left
after her mother died,</font>

48
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:12,487
<font color="yellow">so she came all the way from North Korea
to Macau to look for me.</font>

49
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:15,513
<font color="yellow">Right? I thought so, too.</font>

50
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:20,738
<font color="yellow">But she was with her grandfather
whom she found recently.</font>

51
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,853
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

52
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:31,638
<font color="yellow">This is something new. Did she have a
grandfather in South Korea I didn't know about?</font>

53
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:35,144
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll hang up now.</font>

54
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,910
<font color="yellow">Grandfather will be going to
the company every day now.</font>

55
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,141
<font color="yellow">What if he keeps running into
Mi-poong at the company?</font>

56
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,520
<font color="yellow">It'll be the end of me if he finds out the</font>

57
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:58,303
<font color="yellow">name she used in North Korea is Kim Seung-hee.</font>

58
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,995
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, is there a problem?</font>

59
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,019
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

60
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,768
<font color="yellow">What kind of problem would I have
when you're right next to me like this?</font>

61
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:15,960
<font color="yellow">That's right.
Tell me if you have any problems.</font>

62
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:18,745
<font color="yellow">I'll solve all of them for you.</font>

63
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:24,253
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, let's go on a date
before we go back home.</font>

64
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:29,112
<font color="yellow">We can eat broiled grills for your health
and drink coffee at a coffee shop, too.</font>

65
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:30,722
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

66
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,129
<font color="yellow">Let's do that.</font>

67
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:39,761
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

68
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,105
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

69
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,858
<font color="yellow">How would Shin-ae know
if Geum-sil's daughter-in-law</font>

70
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:49,839
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong is searching
for her grandfather or not?</font>

71
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:55,535
<font color="yellow">What will I do if I just sit by
and get stabbed in the back?</font>

72
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,610
<font color="yellow">This must be it.</font>

73
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:42,206
<font color="yellow">Why do they have to
stay here out of all places?</font>

74
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:46,030
<font color="yellow">I'm a nervous wreck!</font>

75
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,565
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

76
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,292
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

77
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:54,406
<font color="yellow">Why are you peering into my in-law's home?</font>

78
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,831
<font color="yellow">You're like a ghost! You scared me!</font>

79
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,842
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you, what are you doing here?</font>

80
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:07,261
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by, and I was
curious how Hee-ra was doing.</font>

81
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:11,807
<font color="yellow">At your son's wedding,
I couldn't even talk to you</font>

82
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,999
<font color="yellow">because I had to leave early
with a stomachache.</font>

83
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,390
<font color="yellow">That's why I was dropping by.</font>

84
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:24,058
<font color="yellow">I was curious how North Korean
people lived, so I was checking it out.</font>

85
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:25,238
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

86
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,855
<font color="yellow">You don't even acknowledge
Jang-soo as your son-in-law, but</font>

87
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,953
<font color="yellow">you came because you were
curious how Hee-ra was doing?</font>

88
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,527
<font color="yellow">The things you say!</font>

89
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:40,642
<font color="yellow">How can I not be curious
when she's my daughter?</font>

90
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,652
<font color="yellow">You'll give me some tea, right?</font>

91
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:45,191
<font color="yellow">I brought those traditional sweets you love!</font>

92
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:47,832
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil!</font>

93
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:53,409
<font color="yellow">Try them! There's one with pumpkin,
one with red bean, and one with fruits.</font>

94
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,430
<font color="yellow">I bought a variety of them.</font>

95
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,362
<font color="yellow">You love these traditional sweets.</font>

96
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,394
<font color="yellow">I can see right through you.</font>

97
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:03,418
<font color="yellow">See...?</font>

98
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,886
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you can see right through me?</font>

99
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,691
<font color="yellow">I heard everything.</font>

100
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:12,737
<font color="yellow">Your Elder found his biological granddaughter.</font>

101
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:19,261
<font color="yellow">Your family and the Elder
are not even distant relatives.</font>

102
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:24,044
<font color="yellow">Now that you're broke,
do you finally notice Jang-soo?</font>

103
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:27,468
<font color="yellow">Didn't you come here to
give the kids a wedding?</font>

104
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,555
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, this isn't about our kids.
We're friends, right? That's why I came.</font>

105
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:40,434
<font color="yellow">And I'm not broke!</font>

106
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:46,153
<font color="yellow">It's true that I have no right to
inherit Elder's inheritance anymore,</font>

107
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:53,153
<font color="yellow">but his one and only heiress
became my daughter-in-law.</font>

108
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,372
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

109
00:07:55,716 --> 00:08:00,563
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law will inherit everything,
so it'll be the same thing, right?</font>

110
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:04,954
<font color="yellow">It's like a golden calf came into our family.</font>

111
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,458
<font color="yellow">And my daughter-in-law is so nice to me.</font>

112
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:12,200
<font color="yellow">She bought me this.</font>

113
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:19,028
<font color="yellow">And aside from everything else,
my daughter-in-law can't go against my son.</font>

114
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:21,364
<font color="yellow">They love each other so much!</font>

115
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,005
<font color="yellow">You were giving her a hard time because
she hid the fact she was from North Korea.</font>

116
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,195
<font color="yellow">You really wear your heart on your sleeve.</font>

117
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:37,511
<font color="yellow">Anyways, it seems like you and I are
deeply connected to North Korea.</font>

118
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:40,086
<font color="yellow">We both have North Korean daughters-in-law.</font>

119
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,310
<font color="yellow">You were upset too, right?</font>

120
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:50,909
<font color="yellow">Ask your daughter-in-law if...</font>

121
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:56,761
<font color="yellow">she has a grandfather or
any other relatives in South Korea.</font>

122
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,596
<font color="yellow">Who knows? She might have a wealthy
grandfather, like my daughter-in-law.</font>

123
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:06,056
<font color="yellow">How can you say that when you saw their house?</font>

124
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:07,988
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

125
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,232
<font color="yellow">Wealthy grandfather, my foot! She brought two</font>

126
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:15,472
<font color="yellow">burdens with her: her mother and her nephew!</font>

127
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,351
<font color="yellow">She must really not know
that she has a grandfather</font>

128
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:22,370
<font color="yellow">here, or else she would
have looked for him already.</font>

129
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:27,542
<font color="yellow">But where did your daughter-in-law go?
I don't see her.</font>

130
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:28,783
<font color="yellow">She went to work.</font>

131
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,034
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

132
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,440
<font color="yellow">I heard your son was fired from the law firm.</font>

133
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:38,034
<font color="yellow">It's a relief your daughter-in-law
is working at least.</font>

134
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:40,401
<font color="yellow">But where does she work?</font>

135
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,464
<font color="yellow">At the marketing team in Winner's Group.</font>

136
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:46,589
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

137
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:47,995
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

138
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,152
<font color="yellow">Winner's Group?</font>

139
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:51,807
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

140
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,409
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

141
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,311
<font color="yellow">But why are you so surprised?</font>

142
00:09:56,238 --> 00:10:01,786
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. I totally forgot I had plans.</font>

143
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,243
<font color="yellow">See you later!</font>

144
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:12,925
<font color="yellow">Isn't she curious how her daughter is living?</font>

145
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,816
<font color="yellow">She didn't even check her room!</font>

146
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:18,273
<font color="yellow">All she talked about was my daughter-in-law.</font>

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

148
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,571
<font color="yellow">Did she come here to
show off her daughter-in-law?</font>

149
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:27,503
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

150
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:35,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. How can she be
working at Winner's Group?</font>

151
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,903
<font color="yellow">How can things become so messy like this?</font>

152
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:44,018
<font color="yellow">What if she bumps into Mr. Kim,
and they recognize each other?</font>

153
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,011
<font color="yellow">They're blood relatives, after all!</font>

154
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:48,863
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

155
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:53,776
<font color="yellow">Welcome back, father- I mean Mr. Kim.</font>

156
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,589
<font color="yellow">Did you go somewhere, too?</font>

157
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:57,855
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

158
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,034
<font color="yellow">Did the board meeting go well?</font>

159
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,284
<font color="yellow">Yes, mother.</font>

160
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,307
<font color="yellow">Grandfather became the temporary chairman.</font>

161
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:08,573
<font color="yellow">Really? Congratulations!</font>

162
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,089
<font color="yellow">It's only until the company becomes stable.</font>

163
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,978
<font color="yellow">Good job today, Shin-ae.</font>

164
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
<font color="yellow">Go and rest.</font>

165
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:19,163
<font color="yellow">Okay. You should rest, too.</font>

166
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,472
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

167
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,292
<font color="yellow">We're in big trouble! Come here!</font>

168
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,136
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

169
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,995
<font color="yellow">You tell me first.</font>

170
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:38,956
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you have something to tell me as well?</font>

171
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:40,378
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

172
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:42,136
<font color="yellow">You go first.</font>

173
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,812
<font color="yellow">The thing is... oh my gosh.
We're in big trouble.</font>

174
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:49,329
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong works at our company!</font>

175
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,529
<font color="yellow">What? You knew about this, too?</font>

176
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,033
<font color="yellow">I just found out a while ago.</font>

177
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,558
<font color="yellow">She works in the marketing team.</font>

178
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:04,217
<font color="yellow">Grandfather and I were leaving the
board meeting and ran right into Mi-poong.</font>

179
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:07,958
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Did Mr. Kim see her, too?</font>

180
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:13,708
<font color="yellow">Grandfather and Mi-poong already know
each other. They met at Imjingak before.</font>

181
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,443
<font color="yellow">What? Is that true?</font>

182
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:21,598
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! What do we do?
Mr. Kim is going to work at the company, too!</font>

183
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:25,708
<font color="yellow">Then he'll be able to see her often!</font>

184
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,990
<font color="yellow">If they keep bumping into each other,
the secret will be revealed!</font>

185
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:31,751
<font color="yellow">If Mr. Kim asks her...</font>

186
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:38,037
<font color="yellow">what her father's name is and
what her name was in North Korea...</font>

187
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,851
<font color="yellow">then it'll be over for us!</font>

188
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,140
<font color="yellow">We need to separate them to
make sure that never happens!</font>

189
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,078
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

190
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:51,187
<font color="yellow">Mother, I should go work in the company.</font>

191
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,601
<font color="yellow">Yes! Do that!</font>

192
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,687
<font color="yellow">Work there and chase her out!</font>

193
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:06,938
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

194
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,961
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, have some chrysanthemum tea.</font>

195
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,008
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

196
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:19,719
<font color="yellow">The both of you came in together.
Do you have something to tell me?</font>

197
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:21,602
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

198
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:26,626
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae wants to work at the company.</font>

199
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,039
<font color="yellow">You want to work at the company?</font>

200
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,813
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

201
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:32,422
<font color="yellow">I want to work.</font>

202
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,008
<font color="yellow">Before I got married, I used to work
at one of Winner's fashion store,</font>

203
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,836
<font color="yellow">and mother suggested I work as well.</font>

204
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:42,773
<font color="yellow">Yes. I can do the housework.</font>

205
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:49,716
<font color="yellow">I think it would be a huge loss
to the company, society, country,</font>

206
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:56,163
<font color="yellow">and the world if my skillful
daughter-in-law stays stuck at home!</font>

207
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,288
<font color="yellow">Why is she overreacting?</font>

208
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:02,027
<font color="yellow">Grandfather will become suspicious.</font>

209
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:09,535
<font color="yellow">Well, this company might become yours
one day, so you should learn the business.</font>

210
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,078
<font color="yellow">Thank you, grandfather.</font>

211
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,203
<font color="yellow">But since when did the
two of you become so close?</font>

212
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,369
<font color="yellow">It makes me very happy to see
the two of you getting along.</font>

213
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:34,090
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is so kind, father- I mean Mr. Kim.</font>

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,412
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Lawyer Lee Jang-go.</font>

215
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,641
<font color="yellow">I have an interview with the president.</font>

216
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,938
<font color="yellow">I see. Please hold on.</font>

217
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:50,086
<font color="yellow">Sir, Lawyer Lee Jang-go is here.</font>

218
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,493
<font color="yellow">All right. I understand.</font>

219
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:58,485
<font color="yellow">He said he'll call you next time.</font>

220
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:00,618
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

221
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,977
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Jang-go.</font>

222
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,961
<font color="yellow">It's fine. You don't need to feel sorry.</font>

223
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,141
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go.
- Yes?</font>

224
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,985
<font color="yellow">I think I should tell you this.</font>

225
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,212
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

226
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,344
<font color="yellow">Jang & Ko Law Firm is acting low because you</font>

227
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,782
<font color="yellow">broke off the engagement with Jang Ha-yeon.</font>

228
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:29,516
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Mr. Jang has a wide circle.</font>

229
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,365
<font color="yellow">Time will bury what happened, but for now, it</font>

230
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,954
<font color="yellow">won't be easy for you to enter a law firm.</font>

231
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:39,136
<font color="yellow">You know this industry is small.</font>

232
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:43,258
<font color="yellow">Cheer up. Let's get a drink soon.</font>

233
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,399
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Call me.</font>

234
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:46,602
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

235
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,586
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, eat up.</font>

236
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,735
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms. Hwang.</font>

237
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,141
<font color="yellow">But I don't know if it's okay
for me to be here or not.</font>

238
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:06,774
<font color="yellow">It's fine. No one's home right now.</font>

239
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,844
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked you to come.</font>

240
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:14,062
<font color="yellow">I would feel more comfortable
if I made you your favorite noodles</font>

241
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,774
<font color="yellow">one last time before you left.</font>

242
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:19,305
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

243
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,605
<font color="yellow">You're leaving for England tomorrow?</font>

244
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:25,102
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

245
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:29,629
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to end ties with me
because you ended ties with Jang-go.</font>

246
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you for calling me.</font>

247
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:35,274
<font color="yellow">I should be the one grateful
to you for inviting me like this.</font>

248
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:37,781
<font color="yellow">You know how I feel, don't you?</font>

249
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:43,969
<font color="yellow">I really thought of you as my daughter.</font>

250
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:50,539
<font color="yellow">It really would have been nice if we had
become mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.</font>

251
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,118
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

252
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:02,383
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry. Eat up. Here.</font>

253
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:07,564
<font color="yellow">Did someone come?</font>

254
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:11,641
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Who is this?</font>

255
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,429
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, what's going on?</font>

256
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:22,024
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon is leaving for England tomorrow,
so I invited her here to have some noodles.</font>

257
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:26,217
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang, I'll be going now.</font>

258
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:28,130
<font color="yellow">No, Ha-yeon, eat before you go.</font>

259
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:29,376
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

260
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:32,422
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

261
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:35,112
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, eat before you go. Ha-yeon!</font>

262
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,399
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

263
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,258
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon!</font>

264
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:44,152
<font color="yellow">Is she saying good-bye to her lover?
Why is she being so mournful?</font>

265
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:46,306
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

266
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:49,016
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

267
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,032
<font color="yellow">No, Ms. Hwang.</font>

268
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,159
<font color="yellow">Don't come out. I'll be leaving now.</font>

269
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:56,499
<font color="yellow">Forget about everything here and live well.</font>

270
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,157
<font color="yellow">I will. Thank you.</font>

271
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,868
<font color="yellow">Why am I tearing up?</font>

272
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:05,950
<font color="yellow">Don't skip your meals and don't get sick.</font>

273
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,282
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

274
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:08,985
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

275
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,246
<font color="yellow">No, I'm grateful to you.</font>

276
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:14,227
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon,</font>

277
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:18,633
<font color="yellow">in our next lifetime,
let's meet as mom and daughter.</font>

278
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:20,664
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang...</font>

279
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:22,274
<font color="yellow">- Ha-yeon.
- My goodness.</font>

280
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:26,860
<font color="yellow">- What on earth is going on?
- What's wrong with her?</font>

281
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,282
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

282
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,688
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang, I'll be going now.
It's cold, so go inside.</font>

283
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,913
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you off.
- No, it's okay.</font>

284
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,352
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

285
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,032
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

286
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,172
<font color="yellow">Grandmother and aunt, I'm back.</font>

287
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:09,235
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because you might understand,
but we really didn't know she was here.</font>

288
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:15,360
<font color="yellow">It's the truth! My mom and
I didn't know! We just came home!</font>

289
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:17,772
<font color="yellow">I'm going to change my clothes first.</font>

290
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:25,219
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil is being too harsh.</font>

291
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:28,416
<font color="yellow">How would Mi-poong feel right now?</font>

292
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:31,735
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

293
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:50,672
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you trying to do?</font>

294
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:54,868
<font color="yellow">What? "In our next lifetime,
let's meet as mom and daughter?"</font>

295
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:59,485
<font color="yellow">How can you say that when you
have your own daughter-in-law?</font>

296
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,743
<font color="yellow">And how dare you invite Ha-yeon to our house!</font>

297
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:06,914
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Do you have dementia?</font>

298
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,297
<font color="yellow">I thought of Ha-yeon as my daughter.</font>

299
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,485
<font color="yellow">But was it so wrong of me to call her over
and give her a bowl of noodles?</font>

300
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,610
<font color="yellow">Am I doing this because of noodles?</font>

301
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,653
<font color="yellow">And if you wanted to feed her noodles,</font>

302
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:25,188
<font color="yellow">you could have met her
outside and bought her some.</font>

303
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,336
<font color="yellow">I can't invite someone I like to our house?</font>

304
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:32,274
<font color="yellow">Do you think what you did was right?</font>

305
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,134
<font color="yellow">Fine!</font>

306
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,396
<font color="yellow">If you like Ha-yeon so much, no need
to push this into the next lifetime!</font>

307
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:44,965
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a plane ticket to England.
Go and be her mother there.</font>

308
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:52,307
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Ask anyone on the streets what they think!</font>

309
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,672
<font color="yellow">They'll say you're crazy!</font>

310
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,032
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

311
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:59,278
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think you were
wrong this time, Geum-sil.</font>

312
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:02,960
<font color="yellow">I'm almost always on your side,
but this is really wrong.</font>

313
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,410
<font color="yellow">Would I do this if I had any other choice?</font>

314
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:11,555
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have such lingering attachment
if Mi-poong was from a normal family!</font>

315
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:14,293
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel, Nam-yi?</font>

316
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,666
<font color="yellow">You never had a kid before,
so how would you know how I feel?</font>

317
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,168
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, are you done talking?</font>

318
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:25,774
<font color="yellow">No matter how upset you are,
you shouldn't act like this to me.</font>

319
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:28,926
<font color="yellow">Do you think I didn't have
a kid because I didn't want to?</font>

320
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:32,151
<font color="yellow">I got divorced because I couldn't have
a kid, so how can you say that to me?</font>

321
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:34,102
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

322
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:37,947
<font color="yellow">So don't say anything to me!</font>

323
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,153
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel right now?</font>

324
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,741
<font color="yellow">What's all this about?</font>

325
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:49,649
<font color="yellow">Mom, did you invite Ha-yeon to our house?</font>

326
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:52,016
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did!</font>

327
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,934
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon is leaving for England tomorrow,
so I told her to come here</font>

328
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:57,290
<font color="yellow">so that I could see her
one last time, you jerk!</font>

329
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:58,634
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

330
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:04,446
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I gave her an
earful already, so don't do anything.</font>

331
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,626
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

332
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,449
<font color="yellow">The onions are making me cry.</font>

333
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,829
<font color="yellow">Go over there. The onions are spicy.</font>

334
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:53,155
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

335
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:54,459
<font color="yellow">You were upset, huh?</font>

336
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,381
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

337
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:02,436
<font color="yellow">So don't say anything to mother. Okay?</font>

338
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:04,686
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

339
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:08,763
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wait.</font>

340
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:14,381
<font color="yellow">Mother will realize
my feelings one day, won't she?</font>

341
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:17,244
<font color="yellow">I have hope, so I'm okay.</font>

342
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:19,678
<font color="yellow">Yes, she will.</font>

343
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:24,623
<font color="yellow">My wife is so adorable.</font>

344
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:34,795
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye.
- Bye. Go home safely.</font>

345
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

346
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,651
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo!</font>

347
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:45,545
<font color="yellow">- You're done with work, right?
- Yes. But what are you doing here?</font>

348
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:48,652
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

349
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:50,693
<font color="yellow">To me?</font>

350
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,597
<font color="yellow">What is it about that
you came all the way here for?</font>

351
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,006
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Oh, no! Your jacket is ruined!</font>

352
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:19,811
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I can just wash it.</font>

353
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:32,920
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I'm fine.</font>

354
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:39,018
<font color="yellow">It's cold outside. If we stay here, we might</font>

355
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:41,921
<font color="yellow">get wet again, so let's go inside and talk.</font>

356
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,990
<font color="yellow">If it's okay with you, I was hoping you
would come work at Deokcheonok again.</font>

357
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,381
<font color="yellow">That's a bit...</font>

358
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:56,930
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim suddenly said
she wouldn't be able to come out</font>

359
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,443
<font color="yellow">because she had to
take care of her pregnant daughter.</font>

360
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:01,628
<font color="yellow">So can you work with us again?</font>

361
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:07,514
<font color="yellow">Ms. Koo and Ms. Choi would
like you to come back as well.</font>

362
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:13,129
<font color="yellow">If it's too difficult for you,
how about for only a month?</font>

363
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:20,037
<font color="yellow">I thought of the people at
Deokcheonok often as well.</font>

364
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,694
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

365
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:27,795
<font color="yellow">You helped me so much.</font>

366
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:31,865
<font color="yellow">To pay you back, I'll do my best.</font>

367
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:34,742
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms. Joo.</font>

368
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,538
<font color="yellow">But the restaurant I'm working at
right now will need to hire someone else,</font>

369
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:41,277
<font color="yellow">so I think you will need
to give me some time.</font>

370
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:46,053
<font color="yellow">Of course! Take your time
finishing up your current job.</font>

371
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,428
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll do that. Thank you.</font>

372
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:02,296
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

373
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:07,092
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim?</font>

374
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,764
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be there soon.</font>

375
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:20,920
<font color="yellow">I was hoping Dal-ho could do the job,
but I can't do anything without him.</font>

376
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:24,647
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae said she wants
to work at Winner's Group.</font>

377
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,887
<font color="yellow">How about you start
working with her, Hee-dong?</font>

378
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:33,696
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hee-dong. You should help
Mr. Kim with his business now.</font>

379
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:38,272
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I like
the job I'm doing right now.</font>

380
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:43,428
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, you shouldn't reject Mr. Kim.</font>

381
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,561
<font color="yellow">You must accept it.</font>

382
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:51,068
<font color="yellow">No, no. This is something
we can't force him to do.</font>

383
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,475
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to come
to work every single day,</font>

384
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,725
<font color="yellow">but I'll be able to help make the company
newsletter while doing my own job.</font>

385
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:08,326
<font color="yellow">That's a great idea.
You can start with that then.</font>

386
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:11,779
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you. I'll do that, grandfather.</font>

387
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:13,764
<font color="yellow">That idiot!</font>

388
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:16,818
<font color="yellow">He should be taking a position as a director!</font>

389
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:19,201
<font color="yellow">Newsletter, my foot!</font>

390
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,287
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

391
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:30,975
<font color="yellow">Who's this? It's Kim Mi-poong!</font>

392
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,069
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

393
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:34,498
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

394
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,115
<font color="yellow">I work in the marketing team here.</font>

395
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:42,201
<font color="yellow">That brat!
Why does she keep getting in my way?</font>

396
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:45,701
<font color="yellow">I need to enter the company
and chase her out somehow</font>

397
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,874
<font color="yellow">to make sure she can't
bump into grandfather anymore.</font>

398
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:53,999
<font color="yellow">What's on your mind?</font>

399
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:57,369
<font color="yellow">Huh? Oh, nothing.</font>

400
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,761
<font color="yellow">I'm just a bit nervous
about going into the company.</font>

401
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,969
<font color="yellow">But we were going to have a baby.
Won't it be difficult</font>

402
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:07,077
<font color="yellow">since you're going to work at the company now?</font>

403
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:17,251
<font color="yellow">If I get pregnant, I can just
take a break from working.</font>

404
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,001
<font color="yellow">Our baby is more important than work.</font>

405
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,567
<font color="yellow">I wish we can have a baby soon.</font>

406
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:27,246
<font color="yellow">I want a daughter who is just like you.</font>

407
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,440
<font color="yellow">I want a son who is just like you.</font>

408
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:13,587
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

409
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:21,569
<font color="yellow">What's all this? What are you
doing when you should be sleeping?</font>

410
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:25,762
<font color="yellow">I'm preparing some things
for breakfast tomorrow.</font>

411
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:28,465
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to be too busy getting
ready for work in the morning.</font>

412
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,968
<font color="yellow">Will our family die of
starvation if you don't cook?</font>

413
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,243
<font color="yellow">How will you go to work tomorrow like this?</font>

414
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:34,673
<font color="yellow">No. Come in and sleep.</font>

415
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,815
<font color="yellow">I just need to make the radish shreds.
Then I'll be done.</font>

416
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,587
<font color="yellow">Okay then. Give it to me. I'll do it.</font>

417
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:44,889
<font color="yellow">Go in and sleep.</font>

418
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,230
<font color="yellow">How will you make the radish shreds?</font>

419
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:51,251
<font color="yellow">I was part of the kitchen police
when I was in the army.</font>

420
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:03,384
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing in the kitchen?</font>

421
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,384
<font color="yellow">Go in first. I'll quickly
finish this up and go in.</font>

422
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:14,320
<font color="yellow">You make me so happy.</font>

423
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,967
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do? Stop doing
the radish shreds? Should we just go in?</font>

424
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,884
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

425
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:30,651
<font color="yellow">- I'm good, huh?
- Yes.</font>

426
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:41,181
<font color="yellow">This soybean stew is so delicious!</font>

427
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,864
<font color="yellow">How did you make this?
Is it North Korean style?</font>

428
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:49,104
<font color="yellow">That's right! It's delicious!</font>

429
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:54,190
<font color="yellow">I don't need any other
side dishes because of this.</font>

430
00:30:55,189 --> 00:31:01,347
<font color="yellow">If you make soybean stew the wrong way,
it can get brittle and have a bad smell.</font>

431
00:31:01,447 --> 00:31:03,247
<font color="yellow">But this is very delicious.</font>

432
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:07,149
<font color="yellow">My wife made all of this.
Keep that in mind as you eat.</font>

433
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:12,106
<font color="yellow">All the men in our family
become fools when they get married.</font>

434
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:19,376
<font color="yellow">You must have gone through a lot
of trouble to make breakfast, Mi-poong.</font>

435
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:22,126
<font color="yellow">Thank you for enjoying the food.</font>

436
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:26,173
<font color="yellow">But I need to go to work...</font>

437
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:30,209
<font color="yellow">Yes. You'll be late.
Go and get ready. I'll give you a ride.</font>

438
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,441
<font color="yellow">No, the subway is faster.</font>

439
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:37,196
<font color="yellow">But what about the dishes?</font>

440
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:41,611
<font color="yellow">Leave them! Hee-ra isn't
doing anything, so why worry?</font>

441
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:43,105
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go to work.</font>

442
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

443
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,495
<font color="yellow">What? "Hee-ra isn't doing anything?"</font>

444
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:56,271
<font color="yellow">How annoying!
I'm getting compared because of her!</font>

445
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:05,274
<font color="yellow">(We are currently examining and fixing it.)</font>

446
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:16,877
<font color="yellow">What's this, grandpa?</font>

447
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:18,835
<font color="yellow">It's a car, of course.</font>

448
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:24,282
<font color="yellow">It's my gift to you
for your first day of work.</font>

449
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:28,796
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather, thank you!
- You're welcome.</font>

450
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:35,565
<font color="yellow">He gave her a credit card to use freely
and even bought her a new car. She's lucky.</font>

451
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,805
<font color="yellow">Drive carefully. Don't speed. Be safe.</font>

452
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:44,939
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

453
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:49,877
<font color="yellow">- I'll drive you to work.
- Sure.</font>

454
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:52,257
<font color="yellow">No! It's dangerous!</font>

455
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:53,610
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

456
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:57,027
<font color="yellow">My granddaughter said
she'll give me a ride. I should accept.</font>

457
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,365
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Shin-ae.</font>

458
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:00,728
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

459
00:33:01,274 --> 00:33:03,274
<font color="yellow">- Bye, mother.
- Bye.</font>

460
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:05,368
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

461
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:17,086
<font color="yellow">That fox has nine tails.</font>

462
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,414
<font color="yellow">No. She's not a fox anymore.</font>

463
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,414
<font color="yellow">She's my treasure now.</font>

464
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:31,595
<font color="yellow">Yes. I couldn't wish for more if
she just lives happily with my Hee-dong.</font>

465
00:33:39,571 --> 00:33:40,571
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

466
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,039
<font color="yellow">That's our new chairman, and the
woman beside him is his granddaughter.</font>

467
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:52,032
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Then is that woman going
to be the owner of Winner's Group?</font>

468
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,281
<font color="yellow">Yup!</font>

469
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,517
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, aren't you coming?</font>

470
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:02,454
<font color="yellow">That elderly man is Winner Group's chairman?</font>

471
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

472
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,431
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you can't call him that. You need</font>

473
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:09,058
<font color="yellow">to call him chairman. Chairman Kim. Let's go.</font>

474
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:12,392
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

475
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,310
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

476
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:30,610
<font color="yellow">I can't even believe
he's Shin-ae's grandfather.</font>

477
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:35,946
<font color="yellow">But her grandfather is the chairman of
our company? How can this happen?</font>

478
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,812
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim!</font>

479
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,800
<font color="yellow">We have a new director!</font>

480
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,346
<font color="yellow">- Another one?
- Yes.</font>

481
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,140
<font color="yellow">This is your new director.</font>

482
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,575
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Shin-ae.
I look forward to working with you.</font>

483
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,891
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Kim Bo-young.</font>

484
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:57,360
<font color="yellow">Please help me out, Ms. Kim.</font>

485
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,399
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

486
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:18,086
<font color="yellow">Earlier, I pretended not to know you
because you might be uncomfortable.</font>

487
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:22,192
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll only act like
I know you when it's just the two of us.</font>

488
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:23,368
<font color="yellow">Is that okay?</font>

489
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,766
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

490
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,610
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

491
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:34,414
<font color="yellow">I hope you can call me Ms. Park
when we're in the company.</font>

492
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,278
<font color="yellow">Sure, Ms. Park.</font>

493
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,407
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, so I'll leave first.</font>

494
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,938
<font color="yellow">(Director Park Shin-ae)</font>

495
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:23,118
<font color="yellow">Grandfather! Mr. Heo!</font>

496
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:26,345
<font color="yellow">Did you say hello to the marketing team?</font>

497
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:27,735
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

498
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,913
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Heo.
- Yes, sir?</font>

499
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:33,334
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae won't know a lot of things,
so I hope you can help her out.</font>

500
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:35,064
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, sir.</font>

501
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,279
<font color="yellow">Please help me out.</font>

502
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:38,086
<font color="yellow">Work hard.</font>

503
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:39,797
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

504
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,375
<font color="yellow">Then I'll draw some sketches before I leave.</font>

505
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,594
<font color="yellow">Thank you for giving me permission
to do an interview with you.</font>

506
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,414
<font color="yellow">It's not a problem. You donated
comic books to us and helped us a lot.</font>

507
00:36:56,095 --> 00:36:57,118
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

508
00:36:58,329 --> 00:36:59,596
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be going.</font>

509
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:34,368
<font color="yellow">Mister, are you okay?</font>

510
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,948
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt a lot?</font>

511
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:43,797
<font color="yellow">Ouch! Yes, it hurts a lot!
A lump the size of my fist has grown!</font>

512
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:48,257
<font color="yellow">Don't lie! There's no lump
that can be the size of a fist!</font>

513
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,134
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

514
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,751
<font color="yellow">Kang Yoo-jin.</font>

515
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:56,596
<font color="yellow">Kang Yoo-jin? That's a pretty name.</font>

516
00:37:57,118 --> 00:38:02,085
<font color="yellow">Yes! People say I have
a pretty name but a prettier face!</font>

517
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:04,102
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

518
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,698
<font color="yellow">But you speak in a dialect.</font>

519
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,964
<font color="yellow">I'm an ethnic Korean from China.
I'm Miss Yanbian.</font>

520
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,112
<font color="yellow">Miss Yanbian from China?</font>

521
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,239
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you, Miss Yanbian.</font>

522
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,940
<font color="yellow">Do you like the jacket?</font>

523
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,198
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

524
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:01,026
<font color="yellow">It's very warm...</font>

525
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:03,433
<font color="yellow">aunt.</font>

526
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:08,927
<font color="yellow">When it's just the two of us,
you can call me mom.</font>

527
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:11,854
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

528
00:39:12,628 --> 00:39:14,964
<font color="yellow">Can I really call you mom?</font>

529
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,284
<font color="yellow">Yes, but only when it's just the two of us.</font>

530
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:21,540
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean, don't you?</font>

531
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,471
<font color="yellow">Okay, Yoo-jin.</font>

532
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:55,167
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to work now,
so I can only come on the weekends.</font>

533
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:59,432
<font color="yellow">So don't wait for me, okay?</font>

534
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:06,378
<font color="yellow">You didn't tell anyone about me, did you?</font>

535
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:08,468
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell anyone.</font>

536
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

537
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:14,179
<font color="yellow">You can't tell anyone about me.</font>

538
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:19,668
<font color="yellow">You can't tell the orphanage director
or your friends either. Got it?</font>

539
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:28,230
<font color="yellow">If they ask you who I am,
tell them I'm your aunt.</font>

540
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,326
<font color="yellow">That way,
you'll be able to live with me later.</font>

541
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,046
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I mean?</font>

542
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,510
<font color="yellow">Okay, Yoo-jin.</font>

543
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,292
<font color="yellow">Is it too dark?</font>

544
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,393
<font color="yellow">No, no. This is good enough.</font>

545
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,695
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I wore a mini skirt.</font>

546
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:11,307
<font color="yellow">What on earth am I
supposed to do with my legs?</font>

547
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,347
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

548
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,432
<font color="yellow">Hi, Won-bin.</font>

549
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:22,973
<font color="yellow">The wind is blowing outside,
but you're almost naked. Aren't you cold?</font>

550
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,143
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I'm almost naked?</font>

551
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:28,339
<font color="yellow">And the room is heated nicely,
so I'm not cold at all.</font>

552
00:41:29,808 --> 00:41:32,432
<font color="yellow">Why? Is my outfit weird?</font>

553
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:35,075
<font color="yellow">No, it's not weird at all.</font>

554
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:36,830
<font color="yellow">It's totally my style!</font>

555
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:41,643
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, go to the bakery downstairs
and eat some bread.</font>

556
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:42,933
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

557
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,334
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do here?</font>

558
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:52,823
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

559
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,464
<font color="yellow">From now on,
don't come to work looking like this.</font>

560
00:41:57,105 --> 00:42:00,260
<font color="yellow">What? Can't I choose what I want to wear?</font>

561
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,092
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit my store.</font>

562
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:05,401
<font color="yellow">I hate uncomfortable clothes like those.</font>

563
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:09,520
<font color="yellow">Everyone else said I was pretty.
Your eyes are strange.</font>

564
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:11,401
<font color="yellow">Who the heck said you were pretty?</font>

565
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:13,324
<font color="yellow">I can't even look at you!</font>

566
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:14,690
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

567
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,314
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil has a good taste of fashion.</font>

568
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,872
<font color="yellow">You should ask her for advice
and dress like her.</font>

569
00:42:23,363 --> 00:42:25,515
<font color="yellow">What? Dress like her?</font>

570
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,577
<font color="yellow">Yes! Sophisticated and ladylike like her!</font>

571
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:30,831
<font color="yellow">Just like her!</font>

572
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:32,565
<font color="yellow">Fine! I got it!</font>

573
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:37,354
<font color="yellow">Take my sophisticated and ladylike
sister-in-law and work with her!</font>

574
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,745
<font color="yellow">I'm going home now!</font>

575
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,745

It's all thanks to you, sir.</font>

577
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,659

578
00:43:09,814 --> 00:43:13,010
<font color="yellow">The meeting with the presidents of
the banks went on for too long, didn't it?</font>

579
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:16,784
<font color="yellow">No. I just need to go up to
my office and rest a bit.</font>

580
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,626
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim!
- Mr. Kim!</font>

581
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,605

- Mr. Kim!</font>

585
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,417
<font color="yellow">Someone must have fainted!</font>

586
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:47,354
<font color="yellow">- Call 119!
- Mr. Kim!</font>

587
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:49,853
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim isn't breathing!
Hurry up and call 119!</font>

590
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,760
<font color="yellow">Are they on their way?</font>

591
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:09,782
<font color="yellow">Stop it! You'll make it worse!</font>

592
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:11,074
<font color="yellow">Get out of the way!</font>

593
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:23,307
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since
I came here, and yet,</font>

594
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:26,877
<font color="yellow">I miss home so much. How did
you manage to live all this time?</font>

595
00:44:27,113 --> 00:44:30,198
<font color="yellow">- Kim Mi-poong?
- My name is Kim Mi-poong.</font>

596
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:33,926
<font color="yellow">My name is Kim Deok-cheon.</font>

597
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:37,376
<font color="yellow">One day, you'll meet them.</font>

598
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:42,362
<font color="yellow">When I met you at Imjingak for the first time,
you didn't feel like a stranger at all.</font>

599
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:45,050
<font color="yellow">What a coincidence!</font>

600
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,651
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim!
- Mr. Kim!</font>

601
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:02,089
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

602
00:45:06,488 --> 00:45:07,721
<font color="yellow">Hurry! Carry him!</font>

603
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:17,769
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim!</font>

604
00:45:20,902 --> 00:45:23,635
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

605
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:28,073
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim...</font>

606
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:54,846
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, can you see me?</font>

607
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:56,542
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

608
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,018
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

609
00:45:58,761 --> 00:46:01,510
<font color="yellow">You fainted in the company lobby.</font>

610
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,979
<font color="yellow">I remember that.</font>

611
00:46:04,714 --> 00:46:07,984
<font color="yellow">According to Dr. Yang,
you could have been in real trouble</font>

612
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:11,167
<font color="yellow">if CPR hadn't been performed
on you when you had fainted.</font>

613
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:15,633
<font color="yellow">I almost died today.</font>

614
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:20,336
<font color="yellow">But who was the one who performed CPR on me?</font>

615
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,563
<font color="yellow">She's a female employee of our company.</font>

616
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:25,169
<font color="yellow">A female employee?</font>

617
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:27,317
<font color="yellow">I'm very grateful to her.</font>

618
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:33,102
<font color="yellow">Find out who that female employee
who saved my life is.</font>

619
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:36,440
<font color="yellow">Grandfather! Grandfather!</font>

620
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:43,297
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, what happened?</font>

621
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:47,867
<font color="yellow">I was so scared something
bad happened to you...</font>

622
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:50,890
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you!</font>

623
00:46:52,117 --> 00:46:54,250
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm fine.</font>

624
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:58,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, that fox. She's one great actress.</font>

625
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,618
<font color="yellow">She would succeed as an actress.</font>

626
00:47:02,383 --> 00:47:03,664
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

627
00:47:05,515 --> 00:47:07,997
<font color="yellow">He's completely fine.</font>

628
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:11,347
<font color="yellow">Human lives are so long and persistent.</font>

629
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:21,883
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is fine.</font>

630
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:25,301
<font color="yellow">- Thank goodness.
- Really? He's really okay?</font>

631
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:29,293
<font color="yellow">Yes, I personally talked on the phone
with Mr. Heo who went to the hospital.</font>

632
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:33,656
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim asked who had saved his life.</font>

633
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:37,306
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I was complimented.</font>

634
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,764
<font color="yellow">He said our third marketing team was the best.</font>

635
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,235
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

636
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:45,083
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, are you crying?</font>

637
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:49,511
<font color="yellow">You must have been very worried about him.</font>

638
00:47:49,735 --> 00:47:52,172
<font color="yellow">Just... in spite of myself...</font>

639
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,538
<font color="yellow">Anyways, you're amazing.</font>

640
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:58,805
<font color="yellow">I know. I should learn CPR, too!</font>

641
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,830
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

642
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:02,947
<font color="yellow">How about we learn as a group?</font>

643
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:05,986
<font color="yellow">That's a good idea. Let's do that.</font>

644
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:09,601
<font color="yellow">Since we got our paychecks today,
how about we go get a drink?</font>

645
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,249
<font color="yellow">- Deal!
- I'm in!</font>

646
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:12,695
<font color="yellow">I have to hurry up and go home...</font>

647
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:16,079
<font color="yellow">Fine, but only this time.</font>

648
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:17,883
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

649
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,898
<font color="yellow">Where did everyone go without me?</font>

650
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,953
<font color="yellow">This is like living deep in
the mountains by myself.</font>

651
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:37,312
<font color="yellow">Woe is me.</font>

652
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:46,297
<font color="yellow">Hey, Sung-chik!</font>

653
00:48:47,196 --> 00:48:49,936
<font color="yellow">Gwi-ok, there's a big game today.
Want to play?</font>

654
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:52,046
<font color="yellow">One of our members suddenly left.</font>

655
00:48:52,992 --> 00:48:53,992
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

656
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:55,859
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

657
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,750
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

658
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:01,054
<font color="yellow">I'll be there!</font>

659
00:49:02,016 --> 00:49:03,016
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

660
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,920
<font color="yellow">Rather than leech off this house,
I'd rather win big</font>

661
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:15,327
<font color="yellow">and leave this damn house with Chung-ja!</font>

662
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:18,453
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

663
00:49:21,242 --> 00:49:22,523
<font color="yellow">I have no money.</font>

664
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,273
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, I'm sorry.</font>

665
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:47,281
<font color="yellow">I'll win big and pay you back
ten times as much!</font>

666
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,070
<font color="yellow">- Goodness!
- Maid!</font>

667
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,961
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no!
- Where did the maid go?</font>

668
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,344
<font color="yellow">Maid!</font>

669
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:04,584
<font color="yellow">Bring two warm cups of
Chinese quince tea to my room.</font>

670
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:13,524
<font color="yellow">Close the door.</font>

671
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:19,078
<font color="yellow">That old man got right back up.</font>

672
00:50:19,899 --> 00:50:22,464
<font color="yellow">I think he'll live to be
over a hundred years old.</font>

673
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:27,100
<font color="yellow">I'm so anxious that I can't sleep lately.</font>

674
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:32,492
<font color="yellow">No one else knows in this
world but us two, so don't worry.</font>

675
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:36,008
<font color="yellow">What are they talking about?</font>

676
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:41,898
<font color="yellow">The real one is hanging around him,
so how can I not be anxious?</font>

677
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,179
<font color="yellow">What if Mr. Kim finds out you're an imposter?</font>

678
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:52,875
<font color="yellow">I keep dreaming of being
kicked out in this cold weather.</font>

679
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,219
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

680
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:00,227
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

681
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:13,617
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she's an imposter?</font>

682
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,617
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is an imposter?</font>

683
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:21,554
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

684
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,047
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

685
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:35,898
<font color="yellow">How can this happen?</font>

686
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,899
<font color="yellow">Mom, please!</font>

687
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:42,714
<font color="yellow">You damned woman! How dare you mess
with moral laws of family relationships!</font>

688
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:45,581
<font color="yellow">You're going to get punished!</font>

689
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:49,362
<font color="yellow">Mom, Shin-ae and I are
prepared to be punished, but</font>

690
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:52,479
<font color="yellow">we'll be punished next time, so please mom...!</font>

691
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:56,766
<font color="yellow">No matter how much you want
his inheritance, how can you do this?</font>

692
00:51:56,791 --> 00:52:00,282
<font color="yellow">Mom! This isn't just beneficial for us!</font>

693
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:05,179
<font color="yellow">Look how happy Mr. Kim is
after finding his granddaughter!</font>

694
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:07,277
<font color="yellow">That's good, isn't it?</font>

695
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:09,683
<font color="yellow">You said his real granddaughter
hangs around him!</font>

696
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,937
<font color="yellow">No! There's no real granddaughter!</font>

697
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:15,195
<font color="yellow">I heard you say that with my own two ears!</font>

698
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,648
<font color="yellow">How dare you blatantly lie to me!</font>

699
00:52:17,821 --> 00:52:21,088
<font color="yellow">I'm serious, mom!
There is no real granddaughter!</font>

700
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,440
<font color="yellow">- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.</font>

701
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,015
<font color="yellow">You just have to pretend this
didn't happen. You'll do that, won't you?</font>

702
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:30,485
<font color="yellow">Or else all of us will be kicked out of here!</font>

703
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,406
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see me go broke?</font>

704
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,295
<font color="yellow">There's no mother in this world
who wishes for her child to go broke.</font>

705
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:46,851
<font color="yellow">Then you need to take this
secret with you to your grave.</font>

706
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,430
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

707
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,250
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

708
00:52:51,016 --> 00:52:54,413
<font color="yellow">It already happened.
There's nothing we can do about it.</font>

709
00:52:56,164 --> 00:53:01,562
<font color="yellow">I can't help you,
but I won't let you go under.</font>

710
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:03,032
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

711
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:05,563
<font color="yellow">To your grave.</font>

712
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:18,764
<font color="yellow">What's this? Then I don't have
to worry about my later years!</font>

713
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:29,954
<font color="yellow">They're not home yet.</font>

714
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:54,489
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

715
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:56,422
<font color="yellow">Mom! Yoo-sung!</font>

716
00:53:56,751 --> 00:53:58,640
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong!
- Aunt!</font>

717
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:04,500
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

718
00:54:04,525 --> 00:54:09,742
<font color="yellow">You're right next door. I bought some
tangerines on my way home from work.</font>

719
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,277
<font color="yellow">You guys love tangerines.</font>

720
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:16,711
<font color="yellow">And this is your pocket money.</font>

721
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,243
<font color="yellow">I got paid today.</font>

722
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:25,984
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you're married now.
You don't have to take care of me like this.</font>

723
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:29,570
<font color="yellow">Why do I go to work?
It's for you and Yoo-sung.</font>

724
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,247
<font color="yellow">Right, Yoo-sung?</font>

725
00:54:31,446 --> 00:54:32,961
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

726
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,361
<font color="yellow">- Mom, have a tangerine.
- I will.</font>

727
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:39,289
<font color="yellow">It looks tasty.</font>

728
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,062
<font color="yellow">- But mom...
- Yes?</font>

729
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,711
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

730
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:50,460
<font color="yellow">do you know who Shin-ae's grandfather is?</font>

731
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,594
<font color="yellow">He's the chairman of our company.</font>

732
00:54:53,366 --> 00:54:55,706
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Are you serious?</font>

733
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,971
<font color="yellow">Yes. Shin-ae became the director
of the marketing team.</font>

734
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:07,062
<font color="yellow">That kind of influential person
is Shin-ae's grandfather?</font>

735
00:55:07,844 --> 00:55:10,672
<font color="yellow">She told me to call her Ms. Park.</font>

736
00:55:11,671 --> 00:55:16,847
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't want to. It makes me
so bad that I'm her subordinate.</font>

737
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:21,749
<font color="yellow">Come on. Don't be like that.
That's her blessing.</font>

738
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,841
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae was rebuked by
her mother-in-law all this time,</font>

739
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:29,061
<font color="yellow">but now, she has an amazing grandfather.</font>

740
00:55:29,507 --> 00:55:36,429
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae lived a hard life. Wish her the best.
That way, you can be blessed, too.</font>

741
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:40,499
<font color="yellow">You go ahead and wish her
the best. I can't do that.</font>

742
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:42,585
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Fine.</font>

743
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:48,042
<font color="yellow">I'll have to wish her the best twice
as much so that you can be blessed.</font>

744
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:54,945
<font color="yellow">But mom, Shin-ae's grandfather,
who is our chairman,</font>

745
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,953
<font color="yellow">had a heart attack in the lobby today,</font>

746
00:55:59,235 --> 00:56:00,968
<font color="yellow">but I saved him using CPR.</font>

747
00:56:01,774 --> 00:56:02,774
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

748
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

749
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:05,836
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

750
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:12,804
<font color="yellow">You did something amazing! There's nothing
more amazing than saving someone's life!</font>

751
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:15,429
<font color="yellow">You're amazing!</font>

752
00:56:15,977 --> 00:56:17,195
<font color="yellow">My daughter!</font>

753
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:20,891
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

754
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,148
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm late. Bye, mom. Bye, Yoo-sung.</font>

755
00:56:24,696 --> 00:56:25,962
<font color="yellow">Take some of these.</font>

756
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:35,679
<font color="yellow">She must lead a hard married life.
Look at her get up and go so quickly.</font>

757
00:56:36,453 --> 00:56:38,656
<font color="yellow">Goodness! I forgot to give her
the green onion kimchi!</font>

758
00:56:45,828 --> 00:56:46,828
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

759
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,607
<font color="yellow">Did you go to your family's house
as soon as you finished work?</font>

760
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:54,328
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what I said?</font>

761
00:56:55,188 --> 00:56:57,428
<font color="yellow">Why did you get married
if you were going to do this?</font>

762
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,479
<font color="yellow">Just live in your family's house.</font>

763
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:02,976
<font color="yellow">I just dropped by...</font>

764
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,672
<font color="yellow">What? Dropped by?</font>

765
00:57:05,617 --> 00:57:08,345
<font color="yellow">What time does your work end?
What do you mean "dropped by?"</font>

766
00:57:08,532 --> 00:57:12,375
<font color="yellow">And when I talk to you, all you
have to say is, "Yes, I understand."</font>

767
00:57:12,907 --> 00:57:15,779
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back to me!</font>

768
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:17,911
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, mother.</font>

769
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:21,156
<font color="yellow">What are you standing there for?
Go in and make dinner!</font>

770
00:57:21,422 --> 00:57:22,422
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

771
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,110
<font color="yellow">I'm so full.</font>

772
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:02,706
<font color="yellow">I already had a slice of pizza,
so I don't need to eat dinner.</font>

773
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,171
<font color="yellow">Wash these, too, while you're at it.</font>

774
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

775
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:12,551
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did you just call for me?</font>

776
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:15,246
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

777
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:35,804
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me out
all the way to the playground?</font>

778
00:58:35,997 --> 00:58:38,421
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and talk. I'm cold.</font>

779
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:40,953
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra...</font>

780
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:44,716
<font color="yellow">we're both daughters-in-law.</font>

781
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:47,694
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

782
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:52,041
<font color="yellow">While we're living together,
I believe we need to be courteous</font>

783
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:54,698
<font color="yellow">of one another and get
all the chores done together.</font>

784
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,432
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this just because
I asked you to wash the two cups</font>

785
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:01,058
<font color="yellow">and one plate while
you were washing the dishes?</font>

786
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:02,397
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

787
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:05,554
<font color="yellow">Since I'm working,
I was hoping you could make dinner.</font>

788
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:10,639
<font color="yellow">I'll make breakfast, so please make dinner.</font>

789
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:13,421
<font color="yellow">I never did such a thing before,
so I can't do it.</font>

790
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:17,630
<font color="yellow">If you want to make breakfast, you can,
but why are you asking me to make dinner?</font>

791
00:59:18,842 --> 00:59:22,717
<font color="yellow">So you're just going to pile up the
dishes and do nothing about them?</font>

792
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:27,480
<font color="yellow">Whether I do nothing or something,
it's none of your business!</font>

793
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,670
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and make breakfast if you want to!</font>

794
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:33,905
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

795
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:37,467
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

796
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:42,747
<font color="yellow">Who are you to tell me to stop right there?</font>

797
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:48,461
<font color="yellow">Before you came into this family,
I lived a peaceful, perfect life.</font>

798
00:59:48,772 --> 00:59:54,920
<font color="yellow">After you came into our family, grandma
has been scolding me. It pisses me off!</font>

799
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,366
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong!</font>

800
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:05,662
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

801
01:00:05,889 --> 01:00:07,147
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

802
01:00:07,172 --> 01:00:08,172
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

803
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,623
<font color="yellow">Were you waiting for me?</font>

804
01:00:10,452 --> 01:00:11,647
<font color="yellow">What is that you're hiding?</font>

805
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:13,998
<font color="yellow">Huh? Oh, this?</font>

806
01:00:14,608 --> 01:00:16,341
<font color="yellow">Fish-shaped red bean buns!</font>

807
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,014
<font color="yellow">- Fish-shaped red bean buns?
- Yup.</font>

808
01:00:18,225 --> 01:00:19,722
<font color="yellow">My mother loves these.</font>

809
01:00:20,026 --> 01:00:22,404
<font color="yellow">So I bought them as bribery
so she could treat you nicely.</font>

810
01:00:22,429 --> 01:00:24,459
<font color="yellow">Want one? They're still warm.</font>

811
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,140
<font color="yellow">Let's eat them together at home.</font>

812
01:00:28,085 --> 01:00:29,085
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

813
01:00:30,241 --> 01:00:32,818
<font color="yellow">Let's go! It's cold.</font>

814
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:55,038
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr. Heo.</font>

815
01:00:55,335 --> 01:00:56,335
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr. Kim.</font>

816
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,612
<font color="yellow">The one who performed CPR on you today is Kim</font>

817
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:01,875
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong who works in the marketing team.</font>

818
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:04,014
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

819
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:05,358
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong?</font>

820
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,163
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

821
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:11,596
<font color="yellow">She was the one who saved me?</font>

822
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

823
01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:23,149
<font color="yellow">Who did you prepare such a feast for?</font>

824
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,879
<font color="yellow">The company board members?</font>

825
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:28,053
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

826
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:30,295
<font color="yellow">It must be an important person.</font>

827
01:01:30,694 --> 01:01:33,913
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim insisted we prepare
a great meal with sincerity.</font>

828
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:39,881
<font color="yellow">Really? Then is it that broker from China?</font>

829
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,163
<font color="yellow">Broker?</font>

830
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:43,256
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

831
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:48,303
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim found his granddaughter, so why
would he need to meet the broker again?</font>

832
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:54,342
<font color="yellow">That's why they say, "wrongdoing just
makes your own life miserable."</font>

833
01:02:00,302 --> 01:02:03,670
<font color="yellow">Don't mind her. She's just saying that.</font>

834
01:02:04,272 --> 01:02:05,272
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

835
01:02:10,382 --> 01:02:14,148
<font color="yellow">- What about father?
- He's on a business trip in Busan
running an errand for Mr. Kim.</font>

836
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,655
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, who is coming today?</font>

837
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:27,038
<font color="yellow">She's the person who saved me
with CPR when I fainted last time.</font>

838
01:02:27,615 --> 01:02:29,155
<font color="yellow">You know her, too.</font>

839
01:02:30,405 --> 01:02:32,256
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

840
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:34,783
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae knows her?</font>

841
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,420
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

842
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,210
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

843
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:52,247
<font color="yellow">Hello. Welcome, Mi-poong!</font>

844
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:16,438
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

845
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,034
<font color="yellow">Is your grandmother in North Korea?</font>

846
01:03:18,058 --> 01:03:19,058
<font color="yellow">My grandmother...</font>

847
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,442
<font color="yellow">Let's go to my room.</font>

848
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:23,834
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, I have something to tell her,
so can you wait outside?</font>

849
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:26,334
<font color="yellow">We need to make her go
somewhere we can't see her.</font>

850
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:28,803
<font color="yellow">I should shave my head
and go live in the mountain.</font>

851
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:30,491
<font color="yellow">You should chase her out!</font>

852
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,405
<font color="yellow">Wow! That's a lot of cabbage!</font>

853
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,673
<font color="yellow">There are only a hundred of them.
Make kimchi on your own.</font>

854
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:36,815
<font color="yellow">I know you.</font>

855
01:03:37,491 --> 01:03:39,622
<font color="yellow">- Don't make me tired.
- That brat!</font>

856
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:41,311
<font color="yellow">Don't forget what I told you.</font>

857
01:03:41,336 --> 01:03:43,904
<font color="yellow">Can I call you when I miss you?</font>
