00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,697
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, when did you go out?</font>

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,510
<font color="yellow">Mom, hold on.
That's not important right now.</font>

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,227
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra.</font>

6
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:20,694
<font color="yellow">Who is this man? Who is he?</font>

7
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:23,429
<font color="yellow">Is this your boyfriend?</font>

8
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:24,609
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

9
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:29,786
<font color="yellow">Say hello, Jang-soo.
This is my grandma, and this is my mom.</font>

10
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:36,317
<font color="yellow">Hello, grandmother and mother!
I'm Lee Jang-soo!</font>

11
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:38,453
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo?</font>

12
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:42,227
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

13
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:46,156
<font color="yellow">Are you Lee Jang-go's
younger brother Lee Jang-soo?</font>

14
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:49,757
<font color="yellow">Is your mom Hwang Geum-sil?</font>

15
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:55,093
<font color="yellow">Yes, my mom's name is Hwang Geum-sil.</font>

16
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:56,559
<font color="yellow">Do you know her?</font>

17
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:03,318
<font color="yellow">You're the lady who came
to my house last time!</font>

18
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:07,342
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you know him?</font>

19
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:09,810
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Hee-ra.</font>

20
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:15,829
<font color="yellow">It's not him, right?
He's not your boyfriend, right?</font>

21
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,352
<font color="yellow">Please say I'm right. He's not, right?</font>

22
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:21,508
<font color="yellow">No, mom. This is him.
This is the man I love.</font>

23
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:23,242
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra.</font>

24
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,032
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra!</font>

25
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,170
<font color="yellow">- This can't be true!
- Mother!</font>

26
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:32,843
<font color="yellow">Please don't do this, mother!</font>

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,504
<font color="yellow">Please hit me instead!</font>

28
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:38,389
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't hit my delicate Hee-ra.</font>

29
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,242
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

30
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,267
<font color="yellow">Fine!</font>

31
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,593
<font color="yellow">You should get it.</font>

32
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:45,914
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

33
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:47,789
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting him?</font>

34
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,757
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting him
when he did nothing wrong?</font>

35
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,390
<font color="yellow">What did you say? You little brats!</font>

36
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:56,047
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Chung-ja,
get a hold of yourself!</font>

37
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,891
<font color="yellow">Calm down!</font>

38
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,916
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

39
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,703
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

40
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,726
<font color="yellow">Your mom knows about this, doesn't she?</font>

41
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,238
<font color="yellow">You and your mom set this up, right?</font>

42
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,773
<font color="yellow">You guys set this up, right?</font>

43
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:12,617
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

44
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,547
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell me?</font>

45
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,219
<font color="yellow">Are you going to
leave Jang-soo like that?</font>

46
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:34,459
<font color="yellow">Then what else can I do?
He never listens to me.</font>

47
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:39,529
<font color="yellow">That's true, but we need to know
what kind of woman he's dating.</font>

48
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:43,311
<font color="yellow">This is a world where women
are scarier than men.</font>

49
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,092
<font color="yellow">That's true, Geum-sil.
Ask him to let you meet her once.</font>

50
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:49,657
<font color="yellow">We would feel safe if we knew
what kind of woman he is dating.</font>

51
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:53,398
<font color="yellow">What's the point? It's obvious.</font>

52
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:57,977
<font color="yellow">She drank with a man and stayed out overnight.
Would she be a proper lady?</font>

53
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,339
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm saying this! I'm worried!</font>

54
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:08,440
<font color="yellow">If she really is an awful woman,
then we can't let those two continue to meet!</font>

55
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:12,441
<font color="yellow">If a man meets the wrong woman,</font>

56
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:15,612
<font color="yellow">it'll be a matter of time
before he kicks the bucket.</font>

57
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,398
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hwang Geum-sil! Come out!</font>

58
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:19,507
<font color="yellow">What's that noise?</font>

59
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,958
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that your 100 million dollar friend?
- Hwang Geum-sil!</font>

60
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,129
<font color="yellow">- You con-artist!
- I think so. Why is she here again?</font>

61
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:27,922
<font color="yellow">- Come out right now!
- She must be mad!</font>

62
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:30,892
<font color="yellow">How dare she throws
a fit in our neighborhood!</font>

63
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,310
<font color="yellow">Con-artist?</font>

64
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:36,248
<font color="yellow">- I should just...
- Mom! Grandma!</font>

65
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,876
<font color="yellow">What's this?
Isn't this Jang-soo's voice?</font>

66
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,904
<font color="yellow">Mom, that is Jang-soo's voice.</font>

67
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,436
<font color="yellow">- Oh my goodness.
- Come out!</font>

68
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:47,146
<font color="yellow">You thieves!</font>

69
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,210
<font color="yellow">Hwang Geum-sil! I said come out!</font>

70
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:51,235
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo!</font>

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,388
<font color="yellow">Mom! Grandma! Aunt!</font>

72
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,113
<font color="yellow">Be quiet!</font>

73
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,895
<font color="yellow">Ma Chung-ja!
What do you think you're doing?</font>

74
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,615
<font color="yellow">What are you doing
to my precious grandson?</font>

75
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,857
<font color="yellow">- Jang-soo!
- My goodness!</font>

76
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,420
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?
What are you doing to my son?</font>

77
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:11,617
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?
How can you do this to me?</font>

78
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,263
<font color="yellow">Were you that greedy for
your son to be my son-in-law?</font>

79
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,810
<font color="yellow">You sent your oldest first,
and now it's your youngest?</font>

80
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,518
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if you wanted
my inheritance or my daughter Hee-ra!</font>

81
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,739
<font color="yellow">How can you cook up
such a devious plan with</font>

82
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,988
<font color="yellow">your bum of a son
and do something like that?</font>

83
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:30,027
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,520
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what happened?</font>

85
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:36,921
<font color="yellow">What on earth did you do to my friend
that made her treat you this way?</font>

86
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:40,858
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong
but fall in love with Hee-ra.</font>

87
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,966
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh!
- What? Hee-ra?</font>

88
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,783
<font color="yellow">What are you-</font>

89
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:53,909
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, are you dating
this woman's daughter?</font>

90
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,675
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra?</font>

91
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:58,326
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

92
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,113
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh.
- How can this happen?</font>

93
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,719
<font color="yellow">This doesn't make sense!</font>

94
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,263
<font color="yellow">You frightening wench.</font>

95
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:07,995
<font color="yellow">You devious wench.</font>

96
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:12,651
<font color="yellow">You set up this whole thing with your son.
Are you acting right now?</font>

97
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,397
<font color="yellow">Hold on a minute.</font>

98
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:18,807
<font color="yellow">Last time you wore
tiger print boxers and spent</font>

99
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:22,396
<font color="yellow">the night with a woman
who happens to be...</font>

100
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,332
<font color="yellow">her daughter?</font>

101
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:28,027
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

102
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:34,229
<font color="yellow">You wore tiger print boxers
and did what with my daughter?</font>

103
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:42,104
<font color="yellow">How can you do this
to my daughter? How?</font>

104
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:44,797
<font color="yellow">- Mother!
- Chung-ja!</font>

105
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,291
<font color="yellow">Take her inside!</font>

106
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:48,473
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

107
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,385
<font color="yellow">Does she have a fainting disease?
How come she</font>

108
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,096
<font color="yellow">always faints when she
comes to our house?</font>

109
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:57,494
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

110
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:05,355
<font color="yellow">But that woman looks like Mr. Jo's wife.</font>

111
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:12,182
<font color="yellow">Mom, do it one more time.</font>

112
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:13,207
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

113
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:17,587
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. Chung-ja.</font>

114
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,293
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. She woke up.</font>

115
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:21,443
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, are you all right?</font>

116
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:24,237
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

117
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,666
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil.</font>

118
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:29,901
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, how can you do this to me?</font>

119
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,432
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

120
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,065
<font color="yellow">What kind of ill-fated relationship do we have?</font>

121
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:40,232
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, it's a misunderstanding.</font>

122
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:45,494
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know my son and your daughter
were in that kind of relationship.</font>

123
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,712
<font color="yellow">"That kind of relationship?"</font>

124
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,213
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

125
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,998
<font color="yellow">What kind of relationship is that?</font>

126
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:57,679
<font color="yellow">What do I do about my Hee-ra?</font>

127
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:01,438
<font color="yellow">- What do I do?
- Excuse me.</font>

128
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:08,080
<font color="yellow">It's not like Jang-soo forced
your daughter to like him.</font>

129
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,549
<font color="yellow">Nobody died! Why do you keep crying?</font>

130
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:17,627
<font color="yellow">Other people would think Jang-soo
did something horrible to your daughter.</font>

131
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:19,509
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

132
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,867
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

133
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:34,785
<font color="yellow">What I mean is that
I really didn't know</font>

134
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:38,591
<font color="yellow">that my son and your daughter
are dating each other.</font>

135
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:44,089
<font color="yellow">How could you say
I set up this up with my son?</font>

136
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,907
<font color="yellow">Your daughter already went
on a blind date with Jang-go.</font>

137
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,307
<font color="yellow">She really did?</font>

138
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,846
<font color="yellow">- With Jang-go?
- Yes!</font>

139
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:58,048
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, did you know Hee-ra was
my friend's daughter and dated her?</font>

140
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,012
<font color="yellow">You really didn't know?</font>

141
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,430
<font color="yellow">I didn't! I really didn't!</font>

142
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:04,861
<font color="yellow">I swear to God!</font>

143
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,200
<font color="yellow">You heard that, didn't you?
My son didn't know either.</font>

144
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,757
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, this happened
coincidentally like fate.</font>

145
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:19,309
<font color="yellow">But how can this happen?</font>

146
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,697
<font color="yellow">Maybe you and I are fated
to become in-laws.</font>

147
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,307
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

148
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:29,719
<font color="yellow">"Fated to become in-laws?"</font>

149
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,119
<font color="yellow">You and me?</font>

150
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,966

153
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:43,379
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you with my bare hands then!</font>

154
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:44,650
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

155
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,008
<font color="yellow">Mother! Mother!</font>

156

- Why are you hitting him?</font>

out of all people?</font>

160
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:00,634
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since
you broke up with Ms. Song!</font>

161
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,549
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing her up again?</font>

Oh my god!</font>

165
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:18,738
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! This is a hit!
How can this even happen?</font>

166
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,025
<font color="yellow">Hold on a minute.</font>

167
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:24,384

such a bad thing after all.</font>

<font color="yellow">Isn't this a good thing?</font>

169
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,908
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo instead of Jang-go!</font>

<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

171
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,033
<font color="yellow">You may be right.</font>

172
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,970
<font color="yellow">I raised Hee-ra like
she was made out of gold.</font>

173
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,126
<font color="yellow">I put so much effort into raising her.</font>

174
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:51,845
<font color="yellow">She was the apple of my eye.</font>

175
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:56,002
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

176
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:04,157
<font color="yellow">My precious daughter! What do I do?</font>

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
<font color="yellow">Lady!</font>

178
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:23,438
<font color="yellow">Where did you put your head?</font>

179
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:28,122
<font color="yellow">Open up the door!
Locking yourself up won't solve anything!</font>

180
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,282
<font color="yellow">Mister, I'm sorry.</font>

181
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:38,399
<font color="yellow">Mister, I'm sorry!</font>

182
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:41,494
<font color="yellow">Mister, what do I do?</font>

183
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,774
<font color="yellow">What do I do, mister?</font>

184
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:02,973
<font color="yellow">How can this happen?</font>

185
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,938
<font color="yellow">So she's the girl who Jang-go
went on a blind date with?</font>

186
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:11,743
<font color="yellow">But like you said, it must be fate.</font>

187
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:16,849
<font color="yellow">It would be difficult to pull
something like this on purpose.</font>

188
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:20,157
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, don't be
too harsh on Jang-soo.</font>

189
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,040
<font color="yellow">It seems like he really likes Hee-ra.</font>

190
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,096
<font color="yellow">I'm just afraid he'll get a bigger heartbreak
if he falls for her even more.</font>

191
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:29,198
<font color="yellow">You saw what happened.</font>

192
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:33,185
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja didn't even like
Jang-go who is a lawyer.</font>

193
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,700
<font color="yellow">There's no way she'll accept Jang-soo.</font>

194
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,772
<font color="yellow">She'll never let them be together.</font>

195
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,364
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, did you forget already?</font>

196
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,051
<font color="yellow">You bought my phoenix dream.</font>

197
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:47,057
<font color="yellow">That phoenix dream must have
been meant for Jang-soo.</font>

198
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:52,137
<font color="yellow">If my dream is right, your friend will
never be able to handle Hee-ra.</font>

199
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:54,215
<font color="yellow">That's right. Did you ever see a parent</font>

200
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,264
<font color="yellow">overcome a child?
Have you ever overcome yours?</font>

201
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,282
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

202
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:03,481
<font color="yellow">So let's just let it flow.</font>

203
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,507
<font color="yellow">Let Jang-soo deal with it.</font>

204
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,962
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

205
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:18,306

such luck! What good fortune is this!</font>

206
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,923
<font color="yellow">What happens to Hee-ra and me now?</font>

207

who hurt Hee-ra was Jang-go?</font>

<font color="yellow">Is that true? Was I being too harsh?</font>

300
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,054
<font color="yellow">- Just a bit.
- Go easy on her!</font>

301
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:18,335
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

302
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:21,526
<font color="yellow">No, I'm determined.</font>

303
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:25,388
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work hard and
learn fast so that our marketing</font>

304
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:28,481
<font color="yellow">team can become the
best team of Winner's Group!</font>

305
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,991
<font color="yellow">I think we picked
the right new employee.</font>

306
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,740
<font color="yellow">Good! Work with that
kind of confidence, okay?</font>

307
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,772
<font color="yellow">We sincerely welcome you
to our marketing team.</font>

308
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:41,948
<font color="yellow">- Me, too.
- Me, three!</font>

309
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:45,529
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for
welcoming me like this!</font>

310
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,629
<font color="yellow">I will do my best
with actions and not words!</font>

311
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:56,221
<font color="yellow">- You're good at talking, Mi-poong.
Should we drink one more time to that?
- Yes!</font>

312
00:19:57,202 --> 00:20:02,561
<font color="yellow">To our new employee Mi-poong and
to our marketing team! Cheers!</font>

313
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,490
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

314
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,374
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong, you have a dialect.</font>

315
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,271
<font color="yellow">Where are you from? Gangwon-do?</font>

316
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,163
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

317
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:16,824
<font color="yellow">I'm from Pyeongyang.</font>

318
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:21,788
<font color="yellow">Pyeongyang?</font>

319
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:24,103
<font color="yellow">As in the Pyeongyang in North Korea?</font>

320
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:28,646
<font color="yellow">Then you're from North Korea?</font>

321
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,202
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm from North Korea.</font>

322
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:40,495
<font color="yellow">Eat. Let's eat. Eat up.</font>

323
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:49,131
<font color="yellow">I sent a certification of contents
to the mart, but I don't think</font>

324
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,240
<font color="yellow">we'll be able to arrive at
a conclusion with the settlement.</font>

325
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:55,615
<font color="yellow">It seems like they're working
with Janghaenggo.</font>

326
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:57,990
<font color="yellow">I think they're preparing a lawsuit.</font>

327
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:00,888
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about
that enormous law firm that falls</font>

328
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:03,426
<font color="yellow">within the first ten law firms
within the nation?</font>

329
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:06,307
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

330
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,893
<font color="yellow">I knew that would happen.</font>

331
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,402
<font color="yellow">Those scumbags.</font>

332
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,988
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

333
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,377
<font color="yellow">We're going to go through
with the lawsuit.</font>

334
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:27,393
<font color="yellow">Even if we lose,
we're going to go until the end.</font>

335
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,662
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ms. Kim Mi-poong.</font>

336
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,956
<font color="yellow">Are you coming now? You're late.</font>

337
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:57,704
<font color="yellow">How was your first day of work?</font>

338
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,964
<font color="yellow">Was the work hard or was
anyone giving you a hard time?</font>

339
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,297
<font color="yellow">You're too late.</font>

340
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:03,691
<font color="yellow">Did they make you work until so late?</font>

341
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,249
<font color="yellow">Why are you so curious?</font>

342
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,746
<font color="yellow">You need to ask me one question
at a time in order.</font>

343
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,693
<font color="yellow">How am I suppose to answer you
if you ask them all at once?</font>

344
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:15,044
<font color="yellow">Then you can answer them
in order one by one.</font>

345
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,909
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I was worried
about your first day of work?</font>

346
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:21,761
<font color="yellow">Why? Was someone giving you
a hard time? Or was the work too hard?</font>

347
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,519
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

348
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:25,463
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a hard time at all.</font>

349
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:29,835
<font color="yellow">My chief and co-workers are all great,
and the work was manageable.</font>

350
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:33,917
<font color="yellow">And I wasn't working all this time.
I was having dinner with my co-workers.</font>

351
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:36,328
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes, really.</font>

352
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:39,637
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about this "little sister."
Worry about yourself.</font>

353
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:44,130
<font color="yellow">Aww. I'm so proud of my little tadpole.</font>

354
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:45,605
<font color="yellow">You're amazing!</font>

355
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,679
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a kid? You always call me
"tadpole." I'm too old to be a tadpole!</font>

356
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:54,768
<font color="yellow">Well, I just thought you were amazing.</font>

357
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,171
<font color="yellow">And does it make you so mad
that I call you tadpole?</font>

358
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,857
<font color="yellow">But you look like a tadpole.</font>

359
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,722
<font color="yellow">You're getting mad just because I called you
a tadpole for looking like a tadpole.</font>

360
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,025
<font color="yellow">Shut that mouth of yours before I rip you
into shreds and make you into soup, you fish boy!</font>

361
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:13,604
<font color="yellow">What will you do
if I don't shut my mouth?</font>

362
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,839
<font color="yellow">How will you make me into soup?
Explain to me.</font>

363
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,456
<font color="yellow">Will you put bean sprouts
or kimchi in there?</font>

364
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,948
<font color="yellow">Tell me how you'll make me into soup.</font>

365
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:25,962
<font color="yellow">If you keep making me mad,
I'll change the order of your ribs!</font>

366
00:23:26,714 --> 00:23:27,714
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

367
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,214
<font color="yellow">You'll change the order of my ribs? Huh?</font>

368
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:34,189
<font color="yellow">Does that mean
you're going to break my ribs?</font>

369
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:35,339
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

370
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:37,464
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

371
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:40,846
<font color="yellow">She's becoming more and more cruel.
Hey, Kim Mi-poong!</font>

372
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:43,339
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, come back here!</font>

373
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:46,416
<font color="yellow">One, two, three! You're dead! Come here!</font>

374
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,447
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what are you doing?</font>

375
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:03,307
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat this.
The grapes are very sweet and good.</font>

376
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,323
<font color="yellow">Is Yoo-sung sleeping?</font>

377
00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:06,354
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

378
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,153
<font color="yellow">He went to the museum today,
so he must have</font>

379
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:11,948
<font color="yellow">been tired because
he fell asleep while eating.</font>

380
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:12,973
<font color="yellow">While eating?</font>

381
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:16,568
<font color="yellow">How was your first day of work?</font>

382
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,090
<font color="yellow">It's just the beginning, so I'll have
to work hard and become acknowledged.</font>

383
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:25,675
<font color="yellow">If you sincerely work hard,
they'll acknowledge you.</font>

384
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:29,214
<font color="yellow">Even if someone disrespects you because
you're from the north, hold it in.</font>

385
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,967
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about such a thing.</font>

386
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:35,269
<font color="yellow">I'll work hard and become more competent
so that no one will be able to disrespect me.</font>

387
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:36,294
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

388
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:44,341
<font color="yellow">It's good, right? Mi-poong, do you know
what happened at the owner's house today?</font>

389
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:46,332
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

390
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:50,114
<font color="yellow">I saw something very amusing today.</font>

391
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:51,557
<font color="yellow">What did you see?</font>

392
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:55,499
<font color="yellow">The second son of the owner,
so Mr. Lee's younger brother,</font>

393
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:59,517
<font color="yellow">must have gone to the motel
with his girlfriend.</font>

394
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:02,206
<font color="yellow">But then he wore tiger print
boxers to go see her.</font>

395
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,252
<font color="yellow">Tiger print boxers?
Why would he wear those?</font>

396
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:11,518
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know why.</font>

397
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:15,467
<font color="yellow">Anyways, because he wore tiger print
boxers and took</font>

398
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:19,141
<font color="yellow">her to the motel, her mother came
and caused a scene.</font>

399
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:23,531
<font color="yellow">She made a big fuss that she would never
allow them to be together and even fainted.</font>

400
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:29,151
<font color="yellow">All of the owner's family came out
to the yard. What a fight that was.</font>

401
00:25:29,782 --> 00:25:31,175
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

402
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,969
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's the first time I saw something
so amusing after coming to Seoul.</font>

403
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,736
<font color="yellow">If you were here,
we would have watched it together.</font>

404
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:43,352
<font color="yellow">They're right when they say that watching
a fight is the most entertaining.</font>

405
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,735
<font color="yellow">My goodness. It was fun to watch.</font>

406
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:49,171
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom.</font>

407
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:57,194
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong, I think the
girlfriend's mom is Mr. Jo's wife.</font>

408
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,430
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

409
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,471
<font color="yellow">You didn't see wrong?</font>

410
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:02,732
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

411
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:12,000
<font color="yellow">I mean, tiger print boxers?
How humiliating.</font>

412
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:14,730
<font color="yellow">Aunt, are you serious?</font>

413
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:15,969
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

414
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,161
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra's mom came and made a scene.
She cried and fainted. It was chaotic.</font>

415
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:25,417
<font color="yellow">But it hasn't been long since he broke up
with that beauty parlor lady.</font>

416
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,797
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

417
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:30,796
<font color="yellow">We were shocked into silence at first.
Your mom was shocked, too.</font>

418
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:35,039
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened between you and Hee-ra,
but still, how could</font>

419
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:38,702
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo be dating the girl that
your mom tried to set you up with?</font>

420
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:49,453
<font color="yellow">(Princess Baby)</font>

421
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:53,586
<font color="yellow">This phone is currently off,
so please leave a message after the tone.</font>

422
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,024
<font color="yellow">I'm going nuts!</font>

423
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,338
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra isn't getting
in trouble again, is she?</font>

424
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:09,531
<font color="yellow">They shouldn't hit her delicate body!
Gosh! I'm going crazy!</font>

425
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,265
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, we need to talk.</font>

426
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,999
<font color="yellow">No. Don't say anything.</font>

427
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,719
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve to say a word.</font>

428
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:27,423
<font color="yellow">If you say something,
I'll just freaking-</font>

429
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,085
<font color="yellow">"Freaking?" Freaking what?</font>

430
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,844
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

431
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:31,869
<font color="yellow">Are you joking?</font>

432
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:34,511
<font color="yellow">You turned the whole house upside down.</font>

433
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:39,870
<font color="yellow">What I wanted to say was that
I don't want you to say anything to</font>

434
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:43,867
<font color="yellow">me, worry about me, or criticize me
I just want you to trust me.</font>

435
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:45,998
<font color="yellow">Don't bring up the past.</font>

436
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:50,484
<font color="yellow">I know Hee-ra had gone
on a blind date with you.</font>

437
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,837
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

438
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:57,434
<font color="yellow">I did go on a couple dates
with Hee-ra, and I</font>

439
00:27:57,688 --> 00:27:59,992
<font color="yellow">know for a fact that
she doesn't suit our family.</font>

440
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,345
<font color="yellow">She's not someone you can handle!</font>

441
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:06,027
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she suit our family?
Why can't I handle her?</font>

442
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:11,038
<font color="yellow">And I'll be the one
who will handle her or not,</font>

443
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:14,798
<font color="yellow">so don't talk about
my woman like that. Got it?</font>

444
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
<font color="yellow">"My woman?"</font>

445
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,790
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

446
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

447
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,358
<font color="yellow">Get up and listen to me.</font>

448
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,269
<font color="yellow">I know exactly how you feel.</font>

449
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:49,727
<font color="yellow">When I was your age,
I experienced passionate love, too.</font>

450
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:53,910
<font color="yellow">The only thing I could see was him.
I thought I would die if I didn't have him.</font>

451
00:28:55,352 --> 00:29:00,352
<font color="yellow">But if you're not meant to be,
time will make him disappear like bubbles.</font>

452
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,313
<font color="yellow">It'll be nothing!</font>

453
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:04,188
<font color="yellow">Don't lie.</font>

454
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:06,991
<font color="yellow">Dad was your first love.</font>

455
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,991
<font color="yellow">You loved dad, so you seduced him
and got pregnant with</font>

456
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,813
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong and me. That's why
you two were forced to get married</font>

457
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,571
<font color="yellow">Grandma told me everything.</font>

458
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:21,585
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Why would mom
tell her such a thing?</font>

459
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:28,234
<font color="yellow">You got to marry the person you love,
so why are you doing this to me?</font>

460
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
<font color="yellow">I like Jang-soo!</font>

461
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,204
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is that...</font>

462
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:41,227
<font color="yellow">you and that bum
Jang-soo aren't meant to be!</font>

463
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:47,137
<font color="yellow">You need to date someone at your level
in order to be fated together!</font>

464
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:55,758
<font color="yellow">So, Hee-ra, go to New York for no less
and no more than a month.</font>

465
00:29:55,783 --> 00:30:00,493
<font color="yellow">I'll get you a first class ticket
to New York.</font>

466
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,394
<font color="yellow">You have many friends in New York.</font>

467
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:07,244
<font color="yellow">Go hang out with
your friends and shop, too.</font>

468
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,610
<font color="yellow">How about it?</font>

469
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:16,940
<font color="yellow">And think very carefully about this!
What did his mom do to you?</font>

470
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,789
<font color="yellow">She coaxed you to meet Jang-go!</font>

471
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:25,464
<font color="yellow">You fell for that woman and her son's
trap because you're so innocent!</font>

472
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:29,397
<font color="yellow">Because they want
your grandfather's inheritance!</font>

473
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:33,289
<font color="yellow">No! Jang-soo isn't like that!</font>

474
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:40,984
<font color="yellow">And I became Jang-soo's woman,
so I'll never fall for any of your tricks!</font>

475
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,965
<font color="yellow">Whose woman did you become?</font>

476
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,471
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

477
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:49,945
<font color="yellow">Rather than becoming his woman,
you should just die!</font>

478
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:54,587
<font color="yellow">- Die!
- That hurts!</font>

479
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:56,180
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

480
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:07,812
<font color="yellow">Where's my passport?</font>

481
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:09,704
<font color="yellow">Passport?</font>

482
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:12,163
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

483
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,751
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm going to China tomorrow.</font>

484
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:16,172
<font color="yellow">China?</font>

485
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,857
<font color="yellow">For what reason?</font>

486
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:20,309
<font color="yellow">Elder is sending me on a business trip.</font>

487
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:29,143
<font color="yellow">Here's your passport.</font>

488
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:30,313
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

489
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:33,961
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?</font>

490
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:36,275
<font color="yellow">Why? What about my face?</font>

491
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:39,118
<font color="yellow">You're pale as
if you're going to faint soon.</font>

492
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:40,781
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

493
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:41,806
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

494
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:43,729
<font color="yellow">No, nothing is wrong.</font>

495
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,486
<font color="yellow">Even if I go somewhere local,
you want presents,</font>

496
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,195
<font color="yellow">and yet I'm leaving the country,
but you're not begging for presents.</font>

497
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,587
<font color="yellow">All night long you've
been going upstairs. What is it?</font>

498
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:54,945
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra didn't even eat dinner-</font>

499
00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:56,453
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to her?</font>

500
00:31:56,478 --> 00:32:00,249
<font color="yellow">Of course not. There's nothing
that would happen to Hee-ra.</font>

501
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:06,875
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra was teaching me yoga to lose weight,
so I'm a bit dizzy from doing that.</font>

502
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:11,751
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You can get hurt if you don't do
yoga properly. You should be careful.</font>

503
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,776
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

504
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:15,300
<font color="yellow">Hold on.
Do I need to take slippers, too?</font>

505
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,828
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. That was close.</font>

506
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:27,156
<font color="yellow">But why is Elder sending him
all the way to China?</font>

507
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:30,530
<font color="yellow">Is he going to invest
into real estate in China?</font>

508
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,649
<font color="yellow">Whatever. My head hurts.</font>

509
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,020
<font color="yellow">I need to solve this matter with Hee-ra
before he comes back. What do I do?</font>

510
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:44,727
<font color="yellow">Goodness! What can I do about her?</font>

511
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:47,740
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

512
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:02,270
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare lunch tomorrow,
so don't eat before you come.</font>

513
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:27,352
<font color="yellow">About the broker you're going
to meet in China this time...</font>

514
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:33,304
<font color="yellow">I wish I can go with you to meet him.</font>

515
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:36,308
<font color="yellow">What can we do about it when
he refuses because it's dangerous?</font>

516
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,183
<font color="yellow">It seems like things
got more intense nowadays.</font>

517
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:41,834
<font color="yellow">There were many people
who were shot to death after</font>

518
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,717
<font color="yellow">getting caught helping
North Koreans escape.</font>

519
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:45,172
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

520
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,404
<font color="yellow">You're not feeling well these days.
I'll make sure to meet him and talk to him well.</font>

521
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:51,829
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

522
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:57,010
<font color="yellow">I guess it isn't easy for
the broker to go into North</font>

523
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:01,582
<font color="yellow">Korea disguised as a businessman
and try to find people.</font>

524
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:02,758
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

525
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:06,267
<font color="yellow">The situation is pretty terrible,
but he decided to take on this</font>

526
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:09,120
<font color="yellow">task because you promised to give him
more than the usual amount.</font>

527
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,227
<font color="yellow">All right then.</font>

528
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:15,291
<font color="yellow">Things can't go wrong
before they even start.</font>

529
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,609
<font color="yellow">When you meet him yourself,</font>

530
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:24,399
<font color="yellow">do whatever he wants.</font>

531
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,491
<font color="yellow">All right. Don't worry, Elder.</font>

532
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,024
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

533
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:29,049
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho,</font>

534
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:34,133
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad I could rely on you.</font>

535
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

536
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:40,321
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

537
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:46,055
<font color="yellow">Have some hot jujube tea.</font>

538
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,850
<font color="yellow">It's a bit chilly nowadays,
so I made some.</font>

539
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,535
<font color="yellow">All right. Thank you.</font>

540
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:55,264
<font color="yellow">You should drink some, too.</font>

541
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,289
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

542
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:09,681
<font color="yellow">But father, why is
Dal-ho going to China?</font>

543
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:15,002
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

544
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:18,256
<font color="yellow">You still have some time
before your flight schedule.</font>

545
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:21,633
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, it's going to be a long trip.</font>

546
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:27,625
<font color="yellow">So be especially careful
and come back safely.</font>

547
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:31,085
<font color="yellow">Yes, Elder. Don't worry.</font>

548
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:41,313
<font color="yellow">He'll find her.</font>

549
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:50,797
<font color="yellow">He'll find her for sure.</font>

550
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:58,687
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Yoon!</font>

551
00:36:58,712 --> 00:36:59,712
<font color="yellow">Good morning!</font>

552
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:03,532
<font color="yellow">- Did you go home safely last night?
- Yes, I did, but I must</font>

553
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:06,757
<font color="yellow">have drank so much beer because
I kept going to the bathroom!</font>

554
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:07,915
<font color="yellow">Same for me.</font>

555
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:09,820
<font color="yellow">Beer is great, but that's the problem.</font>

556
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,380
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right!</font>

557
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:17,702
<font color="yellow">Mi-kyung, did you hear
that the new employee in</font>

558
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:20,727
<font color="yellow">the third marketing team
is from North Korea?</font>

559
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:21,852
<font color="yellow">North Korea?</font>

560
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,574
<font color="yellow">Then she's a defector?</font>

561
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,563
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

562
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:29,076
<font color="yellow">- What does she look like?
- She probably looks like us.</font>

563
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,923
<font color="yellow">But isn't it a little bit weird?</font>

564
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:40,009
<font color="yellow">Hello! I'm the new employee
Kim Mi-poong in the</font>

565
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,203
<font color="yellow">third marketing team
who is from North Korea.</font>

566
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:45,468
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello...</font>

567
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,875
<font color="yellow">If you're curious about
anything about North Korea</font>

568
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,704
<font color="yellow">or Pyeongyang,
go ahead and ask me anytime.</font>

569
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:51,468
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you!</font>

570
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:58,851
<font color="yellow">Wow. She's something else, huh?</font>

571
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,070
<font color="yellow">That's how she was able to win all
those competitors and enter our company.</font>

572
00:38:03,946 --> 00:38:04,946
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

573
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:12,191
<font color="yellow">Hello! I'm Kim Mi-poong!
I look forward to working with you!</font>

574
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,696
<font color="yellow">(Kim Mi-poong)</font>

575
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,320
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to take this case?</font>

576
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:45,075
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's already been decided.
Why are you asking me again?</font>

577
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:49,480
<font color="yellow">Janghaenggo is one of the
biggest law firms in the country.</font>

578
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:52,820
<font color="yellow">A small office like us can't take it on.</font>

579
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:55,385
<font color="yellow">It's obvious
they're going to destroy us.</font>

580
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,173
<font color="yellow">Must you really do this?</font>

581
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:01,784
<font color="yellow">We haven't settled down yet. If we lose
the case, it'll be more difficult for us.</font>

582
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:04,305
<font color="yellow">Why do you think we'll lose?</font>

583
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:07,190
<font color="yellow">There's a possibility
that we can win this case.</font>

584
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,895
<font color="yellow">And if I work hard and overcome Janghaenggo,
it'll help us settle down faster.</font>

585
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:15,328
<font color="yellow">All the other lawyers
gave up on this case, so why</font>

586
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,687
<font color="yellow">are you trying to play
a game that we'll lose?</font>

587
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:19,307
<font color="yellow">That's why I want to do it even more.</font>

588
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,736
<font color="yellow">I can't ignore their situations.</font>

589
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:27,001
<font color="yellow">You saw the file, so you should know
how hard they worked for the past two</font>

590
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:30,641
<font color="yellow">years to become permanent workers
only to have their contracts broken.</font>

591
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,823
<font color="yellow">Now they have nothing left.</font>

592
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:37,684
<font color="yellow">I became a lawyer so that I can be
of strength on the side of the weak.</font>

593
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,985
<font color="yellow">I want to do my best to help them.</font>

594
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:45,842
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried about you having
to go against Janghaenggo.</font>

595
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:49,617
<font color="yellow">Think how you would feel if lawyers
turned away from you in this situation.</font>

596
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,614
<font color="yellow">It would be very difficult.</font>

597
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:55,257
<font color="yellow">And this is one case I can fight.</font>

598
00:39:56,126 --> 00:40:00,484
<font color="yellow">I'm preparing hard for this,
and I gathered witnesses, too.</font>

599
00:40:02,657 --> 00:40:03,915
<font color="yellow">So don't worry too much.</font>

600
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,610
<font color="yellow">I'm going out.</font>

601
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,842
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Who can stop him
and his stubbornness?</font>

602
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:23,452
<font color="yellow">Mom, how can I pay Geum-sil back?</font>

603
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:26,555
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I'm so upset!</font>

604
00:40:27,118 --> 00:40:30,152
<font color="yellow">Come on. Would she have really
set this up with her son?</font>

605
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:35,789
<font color="yellow">Even if they had, it's Hee-ra's fault
for being stupid enough to fall for it.</font>

606
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:39,852
<font color="yellow">Exactly! Who does she take
after that she's so stupid like this?</font>

607
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:42,743
<font color="yellow">She rejected all those
great, wealthy guys!</font>

608
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:48,204
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! I'm so upset that even if
I die I won't be able to rest in peace!</font>

609
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,348
<font color="yellow">Who does she take after?
Of course she takes after you and me.</font>

610
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:57,814
<font color="yellow">She was so blinded by love
that she didn't even</font>

611
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,493
<font color="yellow">know that was fire and
was drawn to it like a moth.</font>

612
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:03,473
<font color="yellow">Isn't it romantic?</font>

613
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,047
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

614
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,273
<font color="yellow">You better not tell Hee-ra:</font>

615
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:15,257
<font color="yellow">"Your body will turn to dust anyways once
you die, so don't worry and become a moth."</font>

616
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,794
<font color="yellow">Am I crazy? Why would I
say such a thing to her?</font>

617
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:26,151
<font color="yellow">Hey, but why did Elder
send Dal-ho to China?</font>

618
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:30,192
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't even want to know.</font>

619
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,653
<font color="yellow">I went into father's room
with jujube tea this morning,</font>

620
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:38,589
<font color="yellow">and they stopped whispering
to each other about something.</font>

621
00:41:39,243 --> 00:41:43,711
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho didn't even look at me
when he was leaving,</font>

622
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:47,349
<font color="yellow">but he said good-bye
to Elder so affectionately that</font>

623
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:50,357
<font color="yellow">it felt like they
were a separating couple!</font>

624
00:41:50,813 --> 00:41:52,234
<font color="yellow">I was so bewildered.</font>

625
00:41:53,462 --> 00:41:55,289
<font color="yellow">What kind of secret business
are they up to?</font>

626
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,515
<font color="yellow">Like you said, Dal-ho is treating me
like I'm an empty shell!</font>

627
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:04,487
<font color="yellow">Why would Elder make an investment into
China when there's nobody there to manage it?</font>

628
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:08,827
<font color="yellow">If he has leftover money,
he should just buy a building in</font>

629
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:11,685
<font color="yellow">Gangnam or land in Jeju.
Why would he go all the way there?</font>

630
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,945
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

631
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:19,531
<font color="yellow">This is like prison.</font>

632
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,524
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I feel so stuffy and sore.</font>

633
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:28,680
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, I can't stay
like this anymore.</font>

634
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:31,155
<font color="yellow">I need to go get some fresh air.</font>

635
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,941
<font color="yellow">Then what about me? What about Hee-ra?</font>

636
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:37,063
<font color="yellow">You want me to
watch Hee-ra all by myself?</font>

637
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:38,957
<font color="yellow">It's not my problem.</font>

638
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:41,473
<font color="yellow">She's your daughter,
so you take care of her.</font>

639
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,414
<font color="yellow">She has legs.
You can't watch her forever.</font>

640
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,921
<font color="yellow">It's not my problem.</font>

641
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:56,043
<font color="yellow">It's good, right? Eat a lot.</font>

642
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:57,068
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

643
00:43:04,419 --> 00:43:07,122
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, this is meat broth
that was just made.</font>

644
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,083
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

645
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:12,278
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

646
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:22,363
<font color="yellow">So how do you like working here?</font>

647
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:26,278
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

648
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:31,209
<font color="yellow">Everyone is so good to me like I'm part of
the family, so I'm not tired at all.</font>

649
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,222
<font color="yellow">And when I get to talk
to elders from our home country,</font>

650
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:38,317
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm back in Pyeongyang.</font>

651
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,611
<font color="yellow">That's why I really like working here.</font>

652
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,958
<font color="yellow">Really? I see.</font>

653
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:49,270
<font color="yellow">We can speak in our home dialect as much as
we want, which is why I come here often.</font>

654
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,105
<font color="yellow">If I don't hear it for
a day, I get pretty sad.</font>

655
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:57,777
<font color="yellow">I see. I think you would, too.</font>

656
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:03,578
<font color="yellow">But which part of
North Korea did you live in?</font>

657
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:10,889
<font color="yellow">I lived in Chung-guyok,
Changgwang Street.</font>

658
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,891
<font color="yellow">Oh, Chung-guyok,
Changgwang Street?</font>

659
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:19,864
<font color="yellow">I know that's a place
where wealthy families live in.</font>

660
00:44:22,223 --> 00:44:25,098
<font color="yellow">It didn't seem like you
had lived a difficult life.</font>

661
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:27,012
<font color="yellow">I guess I was right.</font>

662
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:34,957
<font color="yellow">Are your parents
still alive in North Korea?</font>

663
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:41,995
<font color="yellow">I had a mother-in-law,
but she passed away a long time ago.</font>

664
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:45,402
<font color="yellow">As for my son and husband...</font>

665
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:48,949
<font color="yellow">while we were escaping...</font>

666
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:50,887
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

667
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:55,009
<font color="yellow">I already heard what had happened
to your son and husband.</font>

668
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:58,895
<font color="yellow">I was shameless to
bring up your family again.</font>

669
00:45:00,645 --> 00:45:03,951
<font color="yellow">Since I'm growing old,
I start talking a lot</font>

670
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:07,208
<font color="yellow">once the topic of
our home country comes up.</font>

671
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:11,731
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.
It's gotten a lot better now.</font>

672
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:13,528
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

673
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:19,616
<font color="yellow">If you have a firm heart and work hard,
you will have a good future.</font>

674
00:45:21,515 --> 00:45:22,515
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

675
00:45:24,843 --> 00:45:26,896
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Feel free to answer it.</font>

676
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:34,350
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

677
00:45:35,241 --> 00:45:40,438
<font color="yellow">Mom, I finished work near the noodle restaurant.
Should I go home with you?</font>

678
00:45:41,726 --> 00:45:43,999
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure. Come here then.</font>

679
00:45:45,187 --> 00:45:49,307
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay. I'm on the second floor
of Deokcheonok.</font>

680
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,890
<font color="yellow">Don't get lost.</font>

681
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:53,062
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

682
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:21,952
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

683
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,213
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming down?
Where are you going?</font>

684
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:29,296
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the kitchen to drink water.</font>

685
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:33,427
<font color="yellow">All right. I got it, so don't
you dare take one more step.</font>

686
00:46:33,702 --> 00:46:35,369
<font color="yellow">You better not come down!</font>

687
00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:38,483
<font color="yellow">Maid! Get Hee-ra some water!</font>

688
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:41,382
<font color="yellow">Fill up a bottle up to
the very brim with water!</font>

689
00:46:41,904 --> 00:46:44,069
<font color="yellow">Forget it! I'm not drinking water!</font>

690
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:49,397
<font color="yellow">I won't drink water or eat food!
I'll starve to death, so do whatever you want!</font>

691
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:52,530
<font color="yellow">If I die, you can do
whatever you want with me!</font>

692
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:56,591
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and sell me to a
congressman's son or a dermatologist!</font>

693
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:05,035
<font color="yellow">That little brat.
What am I supposed to do with her?</font>

694
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:10,926
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, how do I look in this outfit?</font>

695
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,530
<font color="yellow">Why bother asking? It must be difficult
to be such a fashion terrorist.</font>

696
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:18,350
<font color="yellow">Really? Is it that bad?</font>

697
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:21,977
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what do I do?
Today is an important day.</font>

698
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:28,079
<font color="yellow">What do you mean what do you do?
Of course you</font>

699
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:30,146
<font color="yellow">have to change into
something more fashionable.</font>

700
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,565
<font color="yellow">Should I wear a trench coat?</font>

701
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,895
<font color="yellow">How can you wear
a trench coat in this weather?</font>

702
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,533
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, do you remember
the brand-name cardigan</font>

703
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:43,487
<font color="yellow">that mom bought for dad
last year for his birthday?</font>

704
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:47,976
<font color="yellow">Dad's cardigan? Yes! The blue one?</font>

705
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,961
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

706
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:55,081
<font color="yellow">Ask mom to find that one for you.
If you wear that, you'll look very fashionable.</font>

707
00:47:57,852 --> 00:47:58,852
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

708
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,264
<font color="yellow">Thank you.
You're pretty useful sometimes.</font>

709
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:03,817
<font color="yellow">Hey! What do you mean "sometimes?"</font>

710
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,703
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

711
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:13,047
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

712
00:48:14,867 --> 00:48:16,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, hi.</font>

713
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:22,406
<font color="yellow">You know the blue cardigan you
bought for dad last year?</font>

714
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:24,798
<font color="yellow">Can I borrow that today?</font>

715
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:26,859
<font color="yellow">Of course you can!</font>

716
00:48:28,257 --> 00:48:32,350
<font color="yellow">But why are you trying to be
so stylish out of the blue?</font>

717
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:35,791
<font color="yellow">There's something important going on.</font>

718
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:42,617
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since you've gone out,
so I'll definitely find it for you.</font>

719
00:48:42,642 --> 00:48:44,445
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

720
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:07,914
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo!</font>

721
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:10,813
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

722
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:20,836
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

723
00:49:21,813 --> 00:49:24,398
<font color="yellow">If you cry, I'll cry, too!</font>

724
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:32,592
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, I thought I would
never be able to see you again!</font>

725
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:36,558
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't contacted me today,</font>

726
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:39,334
<font color="yellow">I would've confidently marched into
your home and saved you.</font>

727
00:49:39,992 --> 00:49:41,813
<font color="yellow">Of course we'll be
able to see each other!</font>

728
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:45,078
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

729
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:46,764
<font color="yellow">Yes, really.</font>

730
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,489
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if
they refuse to let me in</font>

731
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:51,768
<font color="yellow">or spray salt on me.
I can handle all of that.</font>

732
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:56,085
<font color="yellow">I'm not scared of anything
as long as I can see you.</font>

733
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:57,382
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

734
00:49:58,305 --> 00:50:03,708
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, from now on, I don't think
I can live a day without you.</font>

735
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:04,875
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

736
00:50:05,508 --> 00:50:06,854
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to live!</font>

737
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:09,641
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

738
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:10,666
<font color="yellow">Yes, Jang-soo!</font>

739
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,107
<font color="yellow">Then let's never be apart now.</font>

740
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:17,029
<font color="yellow">From this moment on,
we'll be together forever!</font>

741
00:50:18,828 --> 00:50:21,140
<font color="yellow">Yes! Together forever!</font>

742
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:44,797
<font color="yellow">Please do my hair and make-up lightly
so that I can look innocent.</font>

743
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,372
<font color="yellow">As innocent as possible.</font>

744
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:48,727
<font color="yellow">Yes, miss.</font>

745
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,570
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

746
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:10,836
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

747
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,470
<font color="yellow">Do you need something?</font>

748
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:14,328
<font color="yellow">I need a gift.</font>

749
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,280
<font color="yellow">What kind of flowers do women like?</font>

750
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,775
<font color="yellow">Who are they for? What's her age?</font>

751
00:51:21,781 --> 00:51:23,581
<font color="yellow">She's in her late twenties.</font>

752
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:30,617
<font color="yellow">I would like flowers for
a kind person with a pure heart.</font>

753
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:52,596
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

754
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:53,849
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

755
00:52:58,307 --> 00:52:59,307
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

756
00:52:59,815 --> 00:53:00,815
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

757
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,319
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You didn't
have to bring anything.</font>

758
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:18,322
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

759
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:21,025
<font color="yellow">is it this one?</font>

760
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:23,009
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

761
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:25,447
<font color="yellow">I need a chair.</font>

762
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:28,638
<font color="yellow">I do have a chair,
but it's a revolving one.</font>

763
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:29,908
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

764
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:38,157
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

765
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,044
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

766
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:05,189
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

767
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:07,285
<font color="yellow">Can you turn on the lights?</font>

768
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,310
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

769
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:12,684
<font color="yellow">Wow! The light came on!</font>

770
00:54:15,205 --> 00:54:16,345
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

771
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:19,589
<font color="yellow">- The case.
- Oh, yes.</font>

772
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:27,593
<font color="yellow">I think it's done.</font>

773
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:29,007
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

774
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:31,736
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

775
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:41,744
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

776
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:48,771
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I should have gotten
a better grip on the chair.</font>

777
00:54:49,143 --> 00:54:50,143
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

778
00:54:54,731 --> 00:55:01,198
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much! It's so bright now! Wow!
Having a light makes people a lot happier.</font>

779
00:55:03,153 --> 00:55:05,366
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.
It wasn't anything difficult.</font>

780
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:09,544
<font color="yellow">If you need help with something
like this again, let me know.</font>

781
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:12,239
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

782
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:22,346
<font color="yellow">Oh, please take a seat.
I'll quickly prepare lunch for you.</font>

783
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:23,378
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

784
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:08,784
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

785
00:56:14,346 --> 00:56:15,346
<font color="yellow">Jang Ha-yeon.</font>

786
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,036
<font color="yellow">It's so good to see you, Jang-go!</font>

787
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:19,507
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

788
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,884
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

789
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:22,342
<font color="yellow">I'm saying hello.</font>

790
00:56:22,718 --> 00:56:24,415
<font color="yellow">You're still tacky as ever.</font>

791
00:56:25,655 --> 00:56:27,455
<font color="yellow">How have you been, Jang-go?</font>

792
00:56:28,116 --> 00:56:30,428
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, I missed you a lot.</font>

793
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:32,723
<font color="yellow">Didn't you miss me?</font>

794
00:56:33,218 --> 00:56:34,545
<font color="yellow">I was surprised.</font>

795
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:37,592
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mi-poong!</font>

796
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:41,116
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

797
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:42,889
<font color="yellow">Who...?</font>

798
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:45,441
<font color="yellow">She's my friend's younger sister.</font>

799
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:47,918
<font color="yellow">Oh, your friend's younger sister?</font>

800
00:56:49,428 --> 00:56:50,571
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

801
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,207
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

802
00:56:52,897 --> 00:56:55,071
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?
Did you come to see me?</font>

803
00:56:55,444 --> 00:56:59,153
<font color="yellow">No. I'm here for the noodle restaurant.</font>

804
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,600
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I'm a bit busy.
There's something I need to tell you.</font>

805
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:03,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

806
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,805
<font color="yellow">Let's go in and talk.</font>

807
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:07,241
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

808
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:09,253
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

809
00:57:11,163 --> 00:57:12,874
<font color="yellow">I was surprised.</font>

810
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:31,365
<font color="yellow">But why is she so quiet?</font>

811
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,530
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

812
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:57,280
<font color="yellow">What happened?
I was monitoring from downstairs!</font>

813
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:02,343
<font color="yellow">When I was finding
the cardigan for Hee-dong!</font>

814
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:09,516
<font color="yellow">What do I do? Oh, if I catch her,
I'll shave her head bald!</font>

815
00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:16,099
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear! What's wrong?</font>

816
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:19,068
<font color="yellow">Mom, did you see Hee-ra running away?</font>

817
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:20,528
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra ran away?</font>

818
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,248
<font color="yellow">I won't let this slide!</font>

819
00:58:22,273 --> 00:58:25,699
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, wait for me! Hey!</font>

820
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:32,455
<font color="yellow">So is Jang-soo still in bed?</font>

821
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:33,991
<font color="yellow">He went out.</font>

822
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:35,514
<font color="yellow">What? When?</font>

823
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,912
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I just checked,
and he's not in there.</font>

824
00:58:37,937 --> 00:58:41,217
<font color="yellow">He said he can't get in touch with Hee-ra
because she got her phone taken away.</font>

825
00:58:41,242 --> 00:58:42,830
<font color="yellow">Maybe he went to meet her.</font>

826
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,934
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra! Hee-ra!</font>

827
00:58:46,163 --> 00:58:47,163
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

828
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:48,644
<font color="yellow">What's this noise?</font>

829
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:52,795
<font color="yellow">- Jo Hee-ra!
- Oh my goodness!</font>

830
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,421
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Oh my gosh! How dare you come in here!</font>

831
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,932
<font color="yellow">- Where is Hee-ra!
- How dare you throw a scene in here! Hey!</font>

832
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:02,126
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi! Call the police and report that</font>

833
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:05,121
<font color="yellow">a crazy wench barged into
our home with her shoes on!</font>

834
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:09,175
<font color="yellow">Fine! Go ahead and report me!
I'll report that my daughter was kidnapped!</font>

835
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,487
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Ma Chung-ja! What's wrong with you?</font>

836
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,101
<font color="yellow">You don't think I know
that you planned the whole</font>

837
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:17,052
<font color="yellow">thing out with your son
to steal my daughter?</font>

838
00:59:17,397 --> 00:59:20,918
<font color="yellow">Why are you searching for
your daughter in my house?</font>

839
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:22,372
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

840
00:59:23,157 --> 00:59:25,061
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Chung-ja!</font>

841
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:26,921
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Is it here?</font>

842
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:28,225
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Is Hee-ra here?</font>

843
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:30,964
<font color="yellow">- What?
- My goodness.</font>

844
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:34,259
<font color="yellow">Look at this pathetic,
little house. Goodness!</font>

845
00:59:35,686 --> 00:59:37,240
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

846
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:40,944
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo?</font>

847
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:45,118
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?
Are you with Hee-ra right now?</font>

848
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:48,157
<font color="yellow">Yes, mom. I'm with Hee-ra right now.</font>

849
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,622
<font color="yellow">What? You're with Hee-ra?</font>

850
00:59:52,413 --> 00:59:54,730
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Where is Hee-ra?</font>

851
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:58,985
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll give the phone to Hee-ra.</font>

852
01:00:00,493 --> 01:00:01,560
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

853
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:06,499
<font color="yellow">Hi, mom.</font>

854
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,110
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, where are you?</font>

855
01:00:09,843 --> 01:00:11,585
<font color="yellow">I'll come pick you up.</font>

856
01:00:12,827 --> 01:00:17,065
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be with Jang-soo.
Don't look for me.</font>

857
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,983
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra! Hee-ra!</font>

858
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:26,065
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Oh, my!
Get a hold of yourself! What do I do?</font>

859
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:30,667
<font color="yellow">Tell that Dog Jang-soo
or Cow Jang-soo or whatever his</font>

860
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:33,733
<font color="yellow">name is to bring Hee-ra
back at once! That thief!</font>

861
01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:35,559
<font color="yellow">Dog? Cow? Thief?</font>

862
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,992
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about my grandson?</font>

863
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:42,196
<font color="yellow">Yes! He's the thief!
You're all a bunch of thieves!</font>

864
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:45,077
<font color="yellow">Oh, so Jang-soo is a thief?</font>

865
01:00:45,366 --> 01:00:50,536
<font color="yellow">Then your granddaughter
is a thief, too! A thief!</font>

866
01:00:52,921 --> 01:00:54,719
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

867
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,491
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

868
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:01,129
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

869
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:07,616
<font color="yellow">That crazy woman! I should just-</font>

870
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:09,155
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

871
01:01:22,593 --> 01:01:27,038
<font color="yellow">I promise to never let go of
this hand that I'm holding.</font>

872
01:01:30,827 --> 01:01:32,960
<font color="yellow">Can you promise me, too, Hee-ra?</font>

873
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,257
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

874
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,264
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

875
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:43,280
<font color="yellow">I will never let go.</font>

876
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:45,029
<font color="yellow">That was very delicious.</font>

877
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:47,919
<font color="yellow">Should we sit for a moment?</font>

878
01:02:48,491 --> 01:02:49,491
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

879
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:05,616
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

880
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:10,343
<font color="yellow">No, I should be thankful.</font>

881
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:16,827
<font color="yellow">All I did was change a light bulb,
but I got to eat your delicious cooking.</font>

882
01:03:20,398 --> 01:03:21,398
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

883
01:03:22,343 --> 01:03:28,468
<font color="yellow">I was very grateful
that you ate with me today.</font>

01:03:34,249 --> 01:03:37,921
<font color="yellow">To be honest, today is my birthday.</font>

885
01:03:39,648 --> 01:03:40,648
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

886
01:03:42,312 --> 01:03:43,312

a car accident when I was in high school,</font>

888
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:58,280
<font color="yellow">I spent my birthdays alone.</font>

889
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:08,455
<font color="yellow">But when we were
eating seaweed soup together,</font>

890
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:13,058
<font color="yellow">I felt so strange.</font>

891
01:04:15,296 --> 01:04:19,882
<font color="yellow">I felt so warm...</font>

892
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:30,648
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. What's wrong with me?</font>

893
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:50,861
<font color="yellow">Kiss me. Kiss!</font>

894
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:56,136
<font color="yellow">Don't just look at me. Kiss me.</font>

896
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,070
<font color="yellow">I came to see you, of course.</font>

897
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:27,547
<font color="yellow">You're Lee Jang-go's friend's
younger sister.</font>

898
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:28,571
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

899
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:29,904
<font color="yellow">I knew you would do this.</font>

900
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:32,210
<font color="yellow">That phoenix is worth
at least 50 million dollars.</font>

901
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:34,804
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Jang-soo.</font>

902
01:05:34,828 --> 01:05:37,522
<font color="yellow">I wish I can see you at least one time.</font>
