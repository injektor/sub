the hot springs. What are we doing here?</font>

50
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,038
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to play flower cards?</font>

51

hot springs, go by yourself, you brat!</font>

<font color="yellow">What? Lose to me?</font>

57
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,482
<font color="yellow">I should just rip your mouth off!</font>

58
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,250
<font color="yellow">Come on. Stop it.</font>

59
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:07,876
<font color="yellow">Fine. Here.</font>

60
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:12,766
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. Oh, my!
- My goodness!</font>

61
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:16,225
<font color="yellow">What's this? I do want
to lose to you, grandma,</font>

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,056
<font color="yellow">but what can I do when luck is on my side?</font>

63
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:23,123
<font color="yellow">What's this? Pi and four kwang.</font>

64
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,109
<font color="yellow">- Stop.
- It's starting to get crazy.</font>

65
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:26,282
<font color="yellow">- Stop?
- Yes, stop.</font>

66
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:32,576
<font color="yellow">I don't have pibak or kwangbak, but how did
you get pibak and kwangbak again, grandma?</font>

67
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:33,601
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

68
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:35,798
<font color="yellow">Gimme.</font>

69
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:37,360
<font color="yellow">Mom, give it to him.</font>

70
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:39,407
<font color="yellow">I'm going home.</font>

71
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:40,719
<font color="yellow">- Grandma.
- Grandma.</font>

72
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,196
<font color="yellow">You horrible brats!</font>

73
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,887
<font color="yellow">- Grandma, what's wrong?
- Mom, what's wrong?</font>

74
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:52,460
<font color="yellow">My legs aren't moving!</font>

75
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,079
<font color="yellow">- Your legs won't move?
- Grandma, what's wrong with your legs?</font>

76
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,251
<font color="yellow">Oh, my legs!</font>

77
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,251
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no! What do we do?
- I'm dying!</font>

78
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:07,110
<font color="yellow">- Carry her!
- Grandma, get on my back!</font>

79
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:10,976
<font color="yellow">How can I get on your back
when my legs won't move?</font>

80
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,868
<font color="yellow">- How will you carry her?
- What do I do then?</font>

81
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:16,188
<font color="yellow">- Lift her up!
- Lift her!</font>

82
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:20,868
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm dying!</font>

83
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,732
<font color="yellow">One, two, three!</font>

84
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,047
<font color="yellow">Slowly! Slowly! Slowly!</font>

85
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:30,672
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. There's something going on at home.</font>

86
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:34,051
<font color="yellow">I'm come earlier and
make up for the lost hours.</font>

87
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,189
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

88
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:38,597
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, there aren't
many customers today.</font>

89
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:42,547
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow.</font>

90
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,594
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

91
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,492
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been that long since she started</font>

92
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,783
<font color="yellow">working here again.
We all have issues at home.</font>

93
00:06:56,267 --> 00:07:00,417
<font color="yellow">She's relying on him too much.
What kind of relationship are they in?</font>

94
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:01,939
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

95
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,870
<font color="yellow">You like Mr. Jo, too.</font>

96
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,330
<font color="yellow">You need to stop giving him
smiles with your eyes.</font>

97
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:13,180
<font color="yellow">Was I wrong?</font>

98
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:18,040
<font color="yellow">He looks at her differently
than the way he looks at us.</font>

99
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,822
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed.</font>

100
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:29,478
<font color="yellow">How can we come to the
emergency room just because you</font>

101
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,485
<font color="yellow">couldn't use your legs
from playing flower cards?</font>

102
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,860
<font color="yellow">Aunt, stop it.</font>

103
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:36,798
<font color="yellow">They said there's a lot of people who
get stiff legs from playing flower cards.</font>

104
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,203
<font color="yellow">Don't people who play cards use the bathroom?</font>

105
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,135
<font color="yellow">How can they play cards
until they paralyze their legs?</font>

106
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,672
<font color="yellow">Come on, aunt. That's enough already.</font>

107
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,697
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

108
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,040
<font color="yellow">Is this a hot springs trip?</font>

109
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:50,102
<font color="yellow">Will you stop already?
I should just rip your mouth off!</font>

110
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:58,774
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

111
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:00,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's me.</font>

112
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:03,501
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

113
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,383
<font color="yellow">There's a mountain of cabbages at my house?</font>

114
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,890
<font color="yellow">You guys must be tired.
I can do this by myself.</font>

115
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:20,759
<font color="yellow">Goodness. How will you be
able to do all of this by yourself?</font>

116
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:29,095
<font color="yellow">Your grandmother-in-law and I help each
other out during kimchi-making season.</font>

117
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,340
<font color="yellow">What are neighbors for?</font>

118
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:33,642
<font color="yellow">We should help each other when we can.</font>

119
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,168
<font color="yellow">So don't feel burdened.</font>

120
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,193
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

121
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,663
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, have a taste.</font>

122
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:42,961
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

123
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:47,912
<font color="yellow">How does it taste?</font>

124
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,282
<font color="yellow">It's very delicious!</font>

125
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,844
<font color="yellow">But did you make the seasoning?</font>

126
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,351
<font color="yellow">No, my mom did.</font>

127
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,101
<font color="yellow">My mom did almost everything.</font>

128
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:03,409
<font color="yellow">Your mom is very good!</font>

129
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,532
<font color="yellow">It's delicious! It's so delicious!</font>

130
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,228
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

131
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,079
<font color="yellow">Yes! Thumbs up! Amazing!</font>

132
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,196
<font color="yellow">Thumbs up!</font>

133
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:18,603
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

134
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,805
<font color="yellow">Oh, mom. Oh, dear.</font>

135
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:23,914
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

136
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,344
<font color="yellow">Oh, she's my mom. Mom, these
are my grandmother-in-law's friends.</font>

137
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,392
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

138
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:32,142
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

139
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:34,981
<font color="yellow">But she's your mom?</font>

140
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:41,173
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Other people
might think she's your sister!</font>

141
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:45,438
<font color="yellow">Her sister? Thank you, ma'am.</font>

142
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:49,306
<font color="yellow">- Mom, why did you come? You didn't have to.
- Why else would I come?</font>

143
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:54,571
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am, we'll take it from here.
- Oh, no.</font>

144
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:58,574
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because
I want to, so don't feel burdened.</font>

145
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:03,907
<font color="yellow">But where did everyone else go</font>

146
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:08,969
<font color="yellow">while leaving you to do all the work?</font>

147
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

148
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,579
<font color="yellow">That silly old cow! I'll give her
an earful when she comes back!</font>

149
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,532
<font color="yellow">- I'm so tired.
- Cheer up.</font>

150
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,690
<font color="yellow">- Oh my goodness!
- What's this?</font>

151
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,758
<font color="yellow">What are all these?</font>

152
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,258
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell, you brazen old cow?</font>

153
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:38,665
<font color="yellow">It feels so nice! You feel great, don't you?</font>

154
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,016
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

155
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:44,859
<font color="yellow">Your skin is glowing!</font>

156
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,707
<font color="yellow">You look ten years younger.</font>

157
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,604
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

158
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:56,045
<font color="yellow">Anyways, your daughter-in-law should
be working hard to make kimchi right now.</font>

159
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:59,863
<font color="yellow">Call her and tell her to make broiled pork.</font>

160
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,258
<font color="yellow">Broiled pork goes with just made kimchi.</font>

161
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:07,012
<font color="yellow">But I think a hundred cabbages
were too many for her to do.</font>

162
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,227
<font color="yellow">I should have just made her do fifty of them.</font>

163
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:13,299
<font color="yellow">Fifty cabbages are nothing!</font>

164
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:20,306
<font color="yellow">If you want to chase her out,
you shouldn't get weak-hearted.</font>

165
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,368
<font color="yellow">I know, but...</font>

166
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:26,990
<font color="yellow">what if all that kimchi tastes unpleasant?
We can't just throw them away!</font>

167
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:32,332
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I can be here
while leaving everything up to her.</font>

168
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:36,247
<font color="yellow">Who cares what the kimchi tastes like?</font>

169
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,980
<font color="yellow">What's important is that
she gets sick and tired and leaves.</font>

170
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,508
<font color="yellow">I know, but...</font>

171
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,376
<font color="yellow">what can I do with all of that kimchi?</font>

172
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:49,820
<font color="yellow">What's the problem?
Call Young-soon, Kyung-sook,</font>

173
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:53,308
<font color="yellow">and Soon-jung up and tell them to take some.</font>

174
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,274
<font color="yellow">Only if the kimchi is delicious.</font>

175
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:59,985
<font color="yellow">All fermented kimchi tastes good.
Hurry up and call her!</font>

176
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:01,890
<font color="yellow">- To broil pork?
- Yes.</font>

177
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:05,196
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and call her!</font>

178
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,056
<font color="yellow">You don't need to give us two boxes of kimchi.</font>

179
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:13,459
<font color="yellow">Just take them and eat them.</font>

180
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,517
<font color="yellow">I'll enjoy eating them.</font>

181
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:21,416
<font color="yellow">The kimchi is so delicious
that I simply can't refuse them.</font>

182
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am. Thank you
so much for everything today.</font>

183
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:29,368
<font color="yellow">I'm not just saying this.
The kimchi is very delicious.</font>

184
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,667
<font color="yellow">The southern and northern tastes
mixed up and... oh, that's right!</font>

185
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,450
<font color="yellow">It's unification kimchi!</font>

186
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:40,561
<font color="yellow">What? Unification kimchi?</font>

187
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,047
<font color="yellow">That's a good one!</font>

188
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,008
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

189
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:52,001
<font color="yellow">- Take them. Jang-soo, help them out.
- Okay!</font>

190
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,941
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me.
- Here. Just kidding! I'll carry it!</font>

191
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:59,806
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Bye! Thank you!</font>

192
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:06,172
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, you worked very hard.</font>

193
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:08,758
<font color="yellow">I'm too ashamed to face you.</font>

194
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:12,648
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine. It's not hard
making kimchi together.</font>

195
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:17,376
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I felt a bit
heartbroken that her in-laws</font>

196
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:21,900
<font color="yellow">were purposely giving her a hard time.</font>

197
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,150
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

198
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,868
<font color="yellow">No! My mom and I really didn't know
she was making kimchi!</font>

199
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,478
<font color="yellow">Of course. I know that as well.</font>

200
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:38,204
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

201
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,267
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms. Kim.</font>

202
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,391
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, hurry up and come to the store!</font>

203
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:45,980
<font color="yellow">We're in big trouble!
The new apparel you sent off are gone!</font>

204
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:49,083
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, what are you talking about?</font>

205
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,704
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll be right there.</font>

206
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,469
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something major happen at work?</font>

207
00:13:57,227 --> 00:14:01,422
<font color="yellow">No, but I have to go to the company right now.</font>

208
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,227
<font color="yellow">Sure, go ahead.</font>

209
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:09,344
<font color="yellow">I'll be leaving now, too.
I have to pick up Yoo-sung.</font>

210
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:12,557
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much!</font>

211
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,407
<font color="yellow">- It was nothing. Bye.
- Bye.</font>

212
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:21,073
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil is too mean.</font>

213
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:24,438
<font color="yellow">Where did she go after making Mi-poong
make 100 cabbages into kimchi?</font>

214
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,660
<font color="yellow">She's Cinderella's step-mom.</font>

215
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,712
<font color="yellow">I ought to...</font>

216
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,890
<font color="yellow">I dare her to come home.</font>

217
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,782
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Kim Mi-poong from headquarters.</font>

218
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:50,372
<font color="yellow">What do you mean the apparel didn't come?</font>

219
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,303
<font color="yellow">Why don't you check for yourself?</font>

220
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:56,588
<font color="yellow">Look what's inside.</font>

221
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,571
<font color="yellow">What are all these?
These are the boxes I sent?</font>

222
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,890
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me that?</font>

223
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,850
<font color="yellow">Look. These are the boxes
sent from headquarters.</font>

224
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:19,507
<font color="yellow">That can't be! I really
put the apparel in there!</font>

225
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,710
<font color="yellow">I really checked!</font>

226
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:22,735
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong!</font>

227
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:24,517
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim.</font>

228
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,134
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

229
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,503
<font color="yellow">what on earth happened?</font>

230
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,454
<font color="yellow">I don't know either.</font>

231
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:35,258
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened.</font>

232
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:39,545
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms. Park.</font>

233
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:43,728
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

234
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,864
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, Ms. Park
wants you to come to her office.</font>

235
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:49,945
<font color="yellow">Ms. Park?</font>

236
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:56,501
<font color="yellow">The new apparel that were supposed to
be sent today costs over $50,000 in total.</font>

237
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,977
<font color="yellow">Opportunity makes the thief.</font>

238
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,016
<font color="yellow">Anyone having a hard time can become greedy.</font>

239
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,305
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, hand over the apparel right now.</font>

240
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:11,587
<font color="yellow">We need to keep the promises to
the store managers and the customers.</font>

241
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,059
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

242
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:18,696
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I stole those items?</font>

243
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,305
<font color="yellow">I don't want to think of you
as the culprit either.</font>

244
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:29,206
<font color="yellow">But who else would have done it?
Do those apparel have feet or wings?</font>

245
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:31,125
<font color="yellow">Where would all those items go?</font>

246
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:35,009
<font color="yellow">It's not me. Why would I do
something that obviously points</font>

247
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,494
<font color="yellow">to me as the culprit
when I'm the one in charge of it?</font>

248
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:38,767
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

249
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,274
<font color="yellow">Then explain.</font>

250
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,061
<font color="yellow">Who else would have done this besides you?</font>

251
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,910
<font color="yellow">Where's the evidence that you didn't do this?</font>

252
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:47,712
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

253
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:52,126
<font color="yellow">It's not me. I really didn't do it.</font>

254
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,517
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

255
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,766
<font color="yellow">- Thank you!
- You're welcome.</font>

256
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:09,939
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

257
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,437
<font color="yellow">I'll go meet the driver who delivered
the apparel to check what happened.</font>

258
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:15,143
<font color="yellow">So what you're saying is...</font>

259
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:19,020
<font color="yellow">the truck driver would have taken them, right?</font>

260
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,616
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang, come inside.</font>

261
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,274
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang, did you check with the truck driver?</font>

262
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,539
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

263
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:49,922
<font color="yellow">Are you Mr. Kang Sung-jing
who delivered the apparel today?</font>

264
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:51,493
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

265
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,869
<font color="yellow">Was there a problem while
you were delivering the apparel today?</font>

266
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,172
<font color="yellow">No, there was no problem.</font>

267
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,853
<font color="yellow">All I did was deliver the
apparel to the stores, just as</font>

268
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:04,165
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim Mi-poong from the
3rd marketing team told me to.</font>

269
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:06,258
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there a problem?</font>

270
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong,</font>

271
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,641
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for those lost items.</font>

272
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,317
<font color="yellow">However, we broke
our promise to our customers,</font>

273
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:22,236
<font color="yellow">and our company image has been damaged.</font>

274
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:26,071
<font color="yellow">That can't be paid back with money.
You'll have to take responsibility for it.</font>

275
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,707
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, you're fired.</font>

276
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:33,493
<font color="yellow">What? Fired?</font>

277
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,799
<font color="yellow">Ms. Park, I really didn't do it.
Why don't you believe me?</font>

278
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,462
<font color="yellow">Something went wrong here!</font>

279
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:41,873
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang, take her out of here.</font>

280
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:46,562
<font color="yellow">- Please leave.
- Shin-ae. I mean, Ms. Park. I really didn't do it.</font>

281
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:51,155
<font color="yellow">Please give me some time.
I'll reveal the truth. Ms. Park!</font>

282
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,391
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Drag her out of here.</font>

283
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,634
<font color="yellow">- Yes, ma'am. Come out.
- Shin-ae!</font>

284
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:59,681
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

285
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,056
<font color="yellow">It's over now.</font>

286
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,189
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

287
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:13,282
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

288
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,724
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, get a hold of yourself.</font>

289
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:24,467
<font color="yellow">Even if you go into
a tiger's den, you'll be able</font>

290
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:26,450
<font color="yellow">to live as long as you pull yourself together.</font>

291
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:35,758
<font color="yellow">Yes. That driver will
definitely know something.</font>

292
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:43,735
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang! Please think carefully!</font>

293
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,593
<font color="yellow">Did you ever stop the truck
in the middle of delivery?</font>

294
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,449
<font color="yellow">Why would I stop the truck?</font>

295
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:52,571
<font color="yellow">I delivered to the stores like you told me to!</font>

296
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:54,266
<font color="yellow">But why did the boxes change then?</font>

297
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:58,328
<font color="yellow">I checked them with my own eyes!
Where did the items go?</font>

298
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:00,564
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that?</font>

299
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,441
<font color="yellow">Are you suspecting me right now?</font>

300
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,594
<font color="yellow">Are you disrespecting me because I'm a driver?</font>

301
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,762
<font color="yellow">You're really rude.</font>

302
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,057
<font color="yellow">You were the one who did wrong,
so how dare you blame me!</font>

303
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,015
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang, that's not it...</font>

304
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,107
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

305
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,296
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't live your life like that.</font>

306
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,361
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang!</font>

307
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:28,587
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang!</font>

308
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,134
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jang-go.</font>

309
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:48,868
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mi-poong.</font>

310
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,053
<font color="yellow">Where are you? I'm almost at Seoul.</font>

311
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:54,368
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

312
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:56,501
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come here!</font>

313
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:58,951
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Did something happen?</font>

314
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,488
<font color="yellow">I was falsely charged with theft
and got fired from my job!</font>

315
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,914
<font color="yellow">What? Falsely charged with theft?</font>

316
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,696
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

317
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:25,868
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but can I see this video
taken from a different angle?</font>

318
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:28,415
<font color="yellow">Why? Is something strange?</font>

319
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:31,813
<font color="yellow">No. I wanted to see if there were
any suspicious people in the area.</font>

320
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:34,157
<font color="yellow">Do you have it?</font>

321
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:38,298
<font color="yellow">There are a few cameras in the warehouse,</font>

322
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:43,595
<font color="yellow">but this is the only one
that shows the entrance.</font>

323
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:45,486
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

324
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,151
<font color="yellow">May I take a copy of this video?</font>

325
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,548
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

326
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,478
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

327
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:57,285
<font color="yellow">There was nothing wrong captured
on the camera. What will we do now?</font>

328
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:00,362
<font color="yellow">Don't be too disappointed.
This is just the beginning.</font>

329
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:05,130
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the store. There might have
been something caught on camera there.</font>

330
00:22:05,728 --> 00:22:06,728
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

331
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,313
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

332
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,545
<font color="yellow">Just trust me. I won't let
anything happen to you.</font>

333
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:21,313
<font color="yellow">And I deposited money
into your account, so check it.</font>

334
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:31,738
<font color="yellow">Can't you do help us out?</font>

335
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:36,910
<font color="yellow">I want to, but all the
administrators went home already.</font>

336
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:42,121
<font color="yellow">In order to see the CCTV files, you need
permission from the building owner.</font>

337
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,102
<font color="yellow">Come back tomorrow.</font>

338
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,768
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, don't worry.</font>

339
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:56,798
<font color="yellow">I'll find the evidence
that you're not the culprit.</font>

340
00:22:57,384 --> 00:23:00,634
<font color="yellow">What if we can't find the evidence?</font>

341
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:02,305
<font color="yellow">I'm a lawyer.</font>

342
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,169
<font color="yellow">If I can't find the evidence,
then I'll quit being a lawyer.</font>

343
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:07,738
<font color="yellow">No, you can't do that!</font>

344
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,626
<font color="yellow">So don't worry.</font>

345
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:13,603
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

346
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:26,323
<font color="yellow">It feels so nice after getting a body massage.</font>

347
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:29,670
<font color="yellow">Right? I'm tired and hungry from
getting a massage and shopping.</font>

348
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:33,344
<font color="yellow">- Should we have some broiled pork?
- Yes, let's eat broiled pork!</font>

349
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,358
<font color="yellow">Let's have delicious broiled pork.</font>

350
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:38,251
<font color="yellow">- Hey, come here!
- I'm so hungry!</font>

351
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:39,276
<font color="yellow">Are you talking to me?</font>

352
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,841
<font color="yellow">Hello, ma'am.</font>

353
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,690
<font color="yellow">Mother, when did you come home?</font>

354
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,243
<font color="yellow">Weren't you coming back
from the hot springs tomorrow?</font>

355
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,541
<font color="yellow">It seems like she got a massage
with Ms. Hwang. Her face is glowing.</font>

356
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,529
<font color="yellow">You sent us away to the
hot springs and then secretly</font>

357
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:59,923
<font color="yellow">forced Mi-poong to make
a hundred cabbages into kimchi.</font>

358
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:02,688
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

359
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:06,001
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it on purpose.</font>

360
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,985
<font color="yellow">They were selling the
leftover cabbages for cheap.</font>

361
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:10,407
<font color="yellow">You awful wench!</font>

362
00:24:10,978 --> 00:24:14,657
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm stupid?</font>

363
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:21,776
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. I got free tickets to a massage shop,
so I asked Geum-sil to go with me.</font>

364
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,449
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be like that either!</font>

365
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
<font color="yellow">There is something called natural affection.</font>

366
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:30,427
<font color="yellow">If Mi-poong had to make
a hundred cabbages into kimchi,</font>

367
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:34,255
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you at least offer to help her out?</font>

368
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:38,032
<font color="yellow">It's late, so I'll be going home now.</font>

369
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:45,102
<font color="yellow">You awful wench.</font>

370
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,775
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

371
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:51,423
<font color="yellow">Did I give you such
a hard time with housework?</font>

372
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:53,165
<font color="yellow">You wicked witch!</font>

373
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:56,691
<font color="yellow">Get out of this house right now! Get out!</font>

374
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,603
<font color="yellow">I can't go out.</font>

375
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:00,689
<font color="yellow">What? You can't?</font>

376
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,719
<font color="yellow">Half of this house is under my name.</font>

377
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,508
<font color="yellow">So why do you keep telling me
to get out of this house?</font>

378
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:10,360
<font color="yellow">My son worked hard to buy this house.</font>

379
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,894
<font color="yellow">Yes! My husband worked hard to buy this house!</font>

380
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:19,433
<font color="yellow">Then let's sell this house
and split the money in half!</font>

381
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,818
<font color="yellow">Then I'll leave!</font>

382
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:23,196
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

383
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:26,251
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, aren't you being too harsh?</font>

384
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:29,018
<font color="yellow">What? Sell the house
and split the money in half?</font>

385
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:33,681
<font color="yellow">And did my mom say something wrong?
Even I think you're being too much!</font>

386
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:37,434
<font color="yellow">I don't like Mi-poong either,
but you shouldn't do this!</font>

387
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,907
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do when I hate her?</font>

388
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:42,453
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

389
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,055
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I'm like this either.</font>

390
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:48,571
<font color="yellow">I even hate seeing the back of her head!</font>

391
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:55,571
<font color="yellow">I want to chase her out and get
Jang-go married to Ha-yeon!</font>

392
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,626
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

393
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:03,091
<font color="yellow">Don't criticize me for feeling
differently from you two.</font>

394
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,040
<font color="yellow">They're my feelings!</font>

395
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,016
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

396
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:11,045
<font color="yellow">Was Geum-sil always so spiteful?</font>

397
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:20,571
<font color="yellow">I should never have bought
a house together with her!</font>

398
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:27,671
<font color="yellow">Goodness. That old cow has a temper.</font>

399
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:31,454
<font color="yellow">My gosh. But what happened?</font>

400
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:37,303
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong won't be the one who will have
a hard time doing house work. It's Geum-sil.</font>

401
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:39,525
<font color="yellow">Poor thing.</font>

402
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:41,969
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

403
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:45,341
<font color="yellow">(Daughter-in-law)</font>

404
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,266
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

405
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

406
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,415
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong was fired?</font>

407
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,174
<font color="yellow">Then she won't come out to
work starting from tomorrow?</font>

408
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

409
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:01,141
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! That's great!</font>

410
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:04,984
<font color="yellow">Now Mi-poong and Mr. Kim won't
bump into each other anymore, right?</font>

411
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,124
<font color="yellow">Yes, they won't be able to meet anymore
unless they make plans with each other.</font>

412
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,087
<font color="yellow">Why would they make plans with each other?</font>

413
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:19,162
<font color="yellow">On top of that, she got fired
for such a shameful thing.</font>

414
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:20,501
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

415
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,149
<font color="yellow">I feel like a huge weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.</font>

416
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:30,301
<font color="yellow">Are you coming home now? Come home safely.</font>

417
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,692
<font color="yellow">I'll make the dried yellow corvina
you like so much.</font>

418
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,313
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

419
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:40,376
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law solved it in a single blow.</font>

420
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:43,610
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

421
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:51,376
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil would rather die than
look at her stealing daughter-in-law.</font>

422
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:03,149
<font color="yellow">It's dinnertime.
You shouldn't just be lying here.</font>

423
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:06,266
<font color="yellow">Get up right now and make red bean noodles.</font>

424
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:14,524
<font color="yellow">How can I make red bean noodles
right now? It's going to take a lot of work.</font>

425
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:18,165
<font color="yellow">I must eat red bean noodles no matter what.</font>

426
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:21,342
<font color="yellow">Even though it takes
a lot of work, it'll be easier</font>

427
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,478
<font color="yellow">to make than kimchi out of a hundred cabbages.</font>

428
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:27,465
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll make it for you.</font>

429
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,540
<font color="yellow">Hi, Chung-ja.</font>

430
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:37,258
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about?</font>

431
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,376
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong stole something?</font>

432
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:44,277
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

433
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:51,267
<font color="yellow">We're back.</font>

434
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,486
<font color="yellow">- You two are coming home together.
- Yes.</font>

435
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,298
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

436
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:59,572
<font color="yellow">Is it true you got fired
at work for being a thief?</font>

437
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:02,378
<font color="yellow">Mom, what do you mean she's a thief?</font>

438
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,383
<font color="yellow">You don't even know what's going on.
How can you say that?</font>

439
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,595
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you knew about this, too?</font>

440
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:11,641
<font color="yellow">There was a misunderstanding.</font>

441
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,532
<font color="yellow">What do you mean misunderstanding?</font>

442
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:16,660
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, now isn't the time
for you to be defending her.</font>

443
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:22,486
<font color="yellow">There are rumors that a lawyer's wife
committed theft. Who would give you work?</font>

444
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:28,398
<font color="yellow">My goodness. How dare you act so shamefully.
How will we be able to face anyone now?</font>

445
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,976
<font color="yellow">Mom, I told you it's not true.</font>

446
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:34,391
<font color="yellow">I'll reveal that she's not the culprit.</font>

447
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,626
<font color="yellow">Reveal what?</font>

448
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,354
<font color="yellow">Would they fire her for no reason?</font>

449
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:43,876
<font color="yellow">Did you steal them
so you could help your family?</font>

450
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,976
<font color="yellow">Or did you need money without us knowing?</font>

451
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:52,587
<font color="yellow">My goodness. How can you steal now?</font>

452
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:56,334
<font color="yellow">How much more are you going
to damage Jang-go's future?</font>

453
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,218
<font color="yellow">Mother, I didn't do it. I really didn't!</font>

454
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:01,891
<font color="yellow">How dare you raise your voice at me!</font>

455
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:13,040
<font color="yellow">Mom, Mi-poong is your daughter-in-law, too.</font>

456
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:16,977
<font color="yellow">She's part of your family now.
Can't you defend her and trust her?</font>

457
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,652
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to reveal that she's not
the culprit, so don't say anything until then.</font>

458
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,490
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, she's not the one for you!</font>

459
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,887
<font color="yellow">You should get a hold of yourself now!</font>

460
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:36,409
<font color="yellow">Now you see why I'm like this, don't you?
Now you understand how I feel, don't you?</font>

461
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:40,134
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

462
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:41,969
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

463
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,339
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go inside.</font>

464
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:50,673
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what's going on?</font>

465
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:53,954
<font color="yellow">Stealing? Fired?</font>

466
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:57,195
<font color="yellow">Let's just pretend we didn't hear anything.</font>

467
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,671
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to survive in this house.</font>

468
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:48,857
<font color="yellow"><i>I waited such a long time</i></font>

469
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:52,995
<font color="yellow"><i>Where were you, what were you doing?</i></font>

470
00:31:52,995 --> 00:32:00,669
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you remember me? I missed you so much</i></font>

471
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:09,378
<font color="yellow"><i>After much time, I finally met you</i></font>

472
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:13,348
<font color="yellow"><i>But when you looked at me,</i></font>

473
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:18,754
<font color="yellow"><i>There was only an unknown smile</i></font>

474
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:26,795
<font color="yellow"><i>My love for you is greater than anything</i></font>

475
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:29,698
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if I give up my life,</i></font>

476
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:35,003
<font color="yellow"><i>My love won't go to waste</i></font>

477
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:42,578
<font color="yellow"><i>My love will never change</i></font>

478
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:49,284
<font color="yellow">There's no problem here either.</font>

479
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:52,392
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did they go?</font>

480
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,818
<font color="yellow">Now that you saw everything,
you should leave now.</font>

481
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,150
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

482
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,313
<font color="yellow">Can you zoom in here
and enlarge the license plate?</font>

483
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:04,890
<font color="yellow">Where? Here?</font>

484
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:05,915
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

485
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:07,212
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

486
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:23,998
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

487
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:29,297
<font color="yellow">Why are you bothering me? If you're
going to say nonsense again, just leave.</font>

488
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:31,118
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang.</font>

489
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:35,202
<font color="yellow">If you spill the truth now,
I won't report you to the police.</font>

490
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:37,427
<font color="yellow">So just confess everything.</font>

491
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:40,774
<font color="yellow">You people. What do you
keep telling me to confess?</font>

492
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:45,196
<font color="yellow">You stole the clothes,
so who are you trying to blame it on?</font>

493
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:47,696
<font color="yellow">Don't come looking for me again.</font>

494
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,259
<font color="yellow">Look here!</font>

495
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,272
<font color="yellow">Are you going to act innocent
when the evidence is right here?</font>

496
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,423
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

497
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,056
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

498
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:30,478
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

499
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,952
<font color="yellow">It's not me!</font>

500
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:40,795
<font color="yellow">You better follow me quietly,
or I'll just take you to the police!</font>

501
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:42,368
<font color="yellow">I said it's not me!</font>

502
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,805
<font color="yellow">I'll relay your message to him.</font>

503
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,476
<font color="yellow">Wasn't Kim Mi-poong dismissed?</font>

504
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:01,796
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she was dismissed?</font>

505
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:03,429
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

506
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,781
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, the truth is...</font>

507
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:09,781
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

508
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:11,968
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

509
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

510
00:35:22,047 --> 00:35:23,686
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, what are you doing here?</font>

511
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:34,044
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, why are you with these people?</font>

512
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:37,396
<font color="yellow">I came because Kim Mi-poong
had something to say.</font>

513
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:42,372
<font color="yellow">Please sit down.</font>

514
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,060
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Choi, sit down.
- Yes, sir.</font>

515
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,463
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Lee, you sit down, too.
- Yes, sir.</font>

516
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:01,837
<font color="yellow">What did you need to say?</font>

517
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:07,001
<font color="yellow">I found the evidence that
can prove my innocence.</font>

518
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:09,083
<font color="yellow">Evidence?</font>

519
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,848
<font color="yellow">This is a photo of the
license plate of the truck</font>

520
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:23,263
<font color="yellow">that Mr. Kang was driving
when he left the warehouse.</font>

521
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:29,360
<font color="yellow">This is a photo of the
license plate of the truck</font>

522
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:31,955
<font color="yellow">that Mr. Kang was driving
when he came to the store.</font>

523
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:39,427
<font color="yellow">So Mr. Kang swapped the trucks?</font>

524
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:41,818
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

525
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,605
<font color="yellow">How can you do such a thing?</font>

526
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:55,028
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I misunderstood that it was you.</font>

527
00:36:55,888 --> 00:36:58,794
<font color="yellow">He can't do such a thing alone.
There's someone else involved in this.</font>

528
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:02,732
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

529
00:37:05,404 --> 00:37:06,700
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

530
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:14,365
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

531
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,643
<font color="yellow">I stole the items because my child is sick.</font>

532
00:37:19,857 --> 00:37:23,578
<font color="yellow">I did it because I wanted to sell the items
and use them to pay for the hospital bill.</font>

533
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:28,138
<font color="yellow">I did it alone. No one else
was involved. I'm sorry.</font>

534
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:35,297
<font color="yellow">No matter how much of
a dire situation you were in,</font>

535
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,675
<font color="yellow">how could you blame
someone else for your misdeed?</font>

536
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:40,341
<font color="yellow">That can never be forgiven.</font>

537
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:46,799
<font color="yellow">Fire him and make sure he can
never work at Winner's Group again.</font>

538
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,513
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, I'm sorry!
Please forgive me just this once!</font>

539
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,076
<font color="yellow">And Ms. Park.</font>

540
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:57,012
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather... I mean, Mr. Kim.</font>

541
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,786
<font color="yellow">You didn't even attempt to find out the truth.</font>

542
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:04,075
<font color="yellow">How can you fire your employee so rashly?</font>

543
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:07,455
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't make such a decision so easily.</font>

544
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:15,386
<font color="yellow">Their life depends on this. Next time,
you should be more attentive and careful.</font>

545
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:19,802
<font color="yellow">And take care of
Kim Mi-poong's dismissal right away.</font>

546
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,544
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

547
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,569
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mr. Kim.</font>

548
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:27,537
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mr. Kim.</font>

549
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:31,896
<font color="yellow">Don't thank me.
I'm sorry for upsetting you like this.</font>

550
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,344
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, thank you.</font>

551
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:58,686
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. It's been a while since I worked so hard.
Mi-poong, give me a massage here.</font>

552
00:38:58,982 --> 00:38:59,982
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

553
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:01,513
<font color="yellow">That feels great.</font>

554
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:05,676
<font color="yellow">Should you or should you not
erve your awesome husband?</font>

555
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,685
<font color="yellow">- I should serve him for the rest of my life.
- That's right.</font>

556
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:10,842
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right. Hold on.</font>

557
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,107
<font color="yellow">Hi, grandma. Mi-poong was proven innocent.</font>

558
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:24,342
<font color="yellow">Make sure you tell the family that the real culprit
was caught and that she's going back to work.</font>

559
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:27,834
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

560
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,112
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong and my mother-in-law did that?</font>

561
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,794
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

562
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:43,571
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, is it true that you and your mother
made 100 cabbages into kimchi while I was gone?</font>

563
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,575
<font color="yellow">Did grandma tell you?</font>

564
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:47,982
<font color="yellow">Yes. She told me to treat you well.</font>

565
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:55,091
<font color="yellow">The whole neighborhood is talking about how delicious it is. They call it unification kimchi.</font>

566
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,563
<font color="yellow">What? Unification kimchi?</font>

567
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,596
<font color="yellow">I should do kimchi business later on.</font>

568
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:07,208
<font color="yellow">No wonder you smell like kimchi.</font>

569
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:14,961
<font color="yellow">Really? Do I really smell like kimchi?</font>

570
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:18,810
<font color="yellow">I was just joking.</font>

571
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,981
<font color="yellow">It's so easy to tease you.</font>

572
00:40:22,474 --> 00:40:26,804
<font color="yellow">It hasn't even been a minute since you said you'd
serve your awesome husband for your whole life!</font>

573
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,522
<font color="yellow">If you tease me again,
I'll make you bleed from both nostrils!</font>

574
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:32,036
<font color="yellow">What? Bleed from both nostrils?</font>

575
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,464
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll be careful.</font>

576
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:45,300
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong.
- You came?</font>

577
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:50,775
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm sorry for not being able to help
you when you were going through a hard time.</font>

578
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,068
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

579
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:54,044
<font color="yellow">But we believed in you.</font>

580
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:55,481
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

581
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:57,786
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for worrying you.</font>

582
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:01,596
<font color="yellow">Why should you be sorry? This is my fault.</font>

583
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:04,959
<font color="yellow">I should have ordered for you
to go directly to the stores.</font>

584
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:09,523
<font color="yellow">From now on, let's go directly
to the stores from the warehouse.</font>

585
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,372
<font color="yellow">- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

586
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:14,528
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
- Good job.</font>

587
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:20,325
<font color="yellow">I think it would be good to use something
that people can easily approach...</font>

588
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:23,999
<font color="yellow"><i>Tell me again</i></font>

589
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:28,103
<font color="yellow"><i>That you love me, those words, those words</i></font>

<font color="yellow">Oh my god! That jerk!</font>

737
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:31,884
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

738
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:34,553
<font color="yellow">- Please spread the news about us.
- Come back again!</font>

739
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:35,721
<font color="yellow">We will.</font>

740
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,317
<font color="yellow">Father, why isn't Nam-yi coming out?</font>

741
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:41,312
<font color="yellow">I don't know either.</font>

742
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:44,563
<font color="yellow">The store is very busy. Hurry up and call her.</font>

743
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,798
<font color="yellow">We need to know why she's not coming.</font>

744
00:51:55,096 --> 00:51:56,299
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, father?</font>

745
00:51:58,268 --> 00:52:01,758
<font color="yellow">I'll call with my phone,
but can you talk to her?</font>

746
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:04,557
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Don't ask me why.</font>

747
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:06,538
<font color="yellow">All right. I will.</font>

748
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:10,510
<font color="yellow">If she answers, tell her she must come
to work and that the store is very busy.</font>

749
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:12,292
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

750
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:13,627
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

751
00:52:16,495 --> 00:52:17,495
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

752
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:22,784
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

753
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:26,213
<font color="yellow">This isn't Mr. Kim's voice.</font>

754
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:28,728
<font color="yellow">Is this Won-bin?</font>

755
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,927
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Kim Won-bin.</font>

756
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:34,541
<font color="yellow">My father would like for you
to come out to work.</font>

757
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:39,326
<font color="yellow">I told him I was going to quit. Ask him
why he's making an irrelevant remark.</font>

758
00:52:39,971 --> 00:52:42,283
<font color="yellow">She said she told you
that she was going to quit,</font>

759
00:52:42,308 --> 00:52:44,456
<font color="yellow">so she wants to know why you're
making an irrelevant remark.</font>

760
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:50,118
<font color="yellow">Tell her that she's irresponsible
and that I'm very disappointed in her!</font>

761
00:52:50,142 --> 00:52:54,064
<font color="yellow">Tell her that she has to work until I find
another employee! Tell her it's an order!</font>

762
00:52:56,248 --> 00:53:01,826
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, my father is begging you to come
work until he finds another employee.</font>

763
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:03,174
<font color="yellow">Kim Won-bin, you-!</font>

764
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,599
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

765
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:06,529
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, I heard everything.</font>

766
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,818
<font color="yellow">Am I his wife or his underling?</font>

767
00:53:10,224 --> 00:53:14,299
<font color="yellow">Who the hell does he think he is?
Tell him that I'll never come to work!</font>

768
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:19,115
<font color="yellow">What did she say?</font>

769
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:23,280
<font color="yellow">She said she can't come to work.
She said she's not your wife</font>

770
00:53:23,305 --> 00:53:25,981
<font color="yellow">or underling so that you can't
order her around anymore.</font>

771
00:53:28,662 --> 00:53:31,307
<font color="yellow">Father, you need to learn about women.</font>

772
00:53:46,011 --> 00:53:47,955
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what about this?</font>

773
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:52,876
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's awesome!</font>

774
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:54,877
<font color="yellow">Then what about this one?</font>

775
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:56,393
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's good, too.</font>

776
00:53:56,854 --> 00:53:58,474
<font color="yellow">You can't say that about everything.</font>

777
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:01,708
<font color="yellow">But they're all great. What else can I say?</font>

778
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:02,917
<font color="yellow">Forget it!</font>

779
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,470
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me for the next two hours.</font>

780
00:54:06,308 --> 00:54:09,508
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to
a pumpkin head like you.</font>

781
00:54:10,393 --> 00:54:14,627
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I'm going
to live depending on you.</font>

782
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,182
<font color="yellow">You! You! You! You!</font>

783
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:19,862
<font color="yellow">How many days has it passed since
you promised to serve your awesome husband?</font>

784
00:54:19,887 --> 00:54:24,511
<font color="yellow">I don't know! I'll have to make 100 cabbages into
kimchi again next year because of you!</font>

785
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:31,281
<font color="yellow">Then choose one out of these three.
You can do that, can't you?</font>

786
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:32,878
<font color="yellow">This one?</font>

787
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:35,775
<font color="yellow">Yes, that one is good.</font>

788
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:37,479
<font color="yellow">Then what about this one?</font>

789
00:54:38,494 --> 00:54:41,182
<font color="yellow">This one seems a little bit better...</font>

790
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:43,870
<font color="yellow">Then this one...?</font>

791
00:54:46,776 --> 00:54:47,976
<font color="yellow">Let's buy that one.</font>

792
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:02,315
<font color="yellow">Mom, pick one out of the three.
Which one do you like the best?</font>

793
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:13,862
<font color="yellow">Mother didn't respond yet?</font>

794
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,940
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

795
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:19,368
<font color="yellow">My mom seems to be very angry.</font>

796
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:21,120
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

797
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:24,787
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's just go home.</font>

798
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,727
<font color="yellow">We'll bring her later
when she isn't angry anymore.</font>

799
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:30,171
<font color="yellow">If we buy it and she doesn't like it,
it'll be a waste.</font>

800
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:35,315
<font color="yellow">Something came.</font>

801
00:55:38,558 --> 00:55:40,024
<font color="yellow">- Is it mother?
- Yes.</font>

802
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:42,018
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

803
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,495
<font color="yellow">I knew it would be number three!</font>

804
00:55:45,205 --> 00:55:48,197
<font color="yellow">- She's not angry anymore.
- I'm so glad!</font>

805
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:51,073
<font color="yellow">Let's buy number three.</font>

806
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,205
<font color="yellow">What? Mi-poong wasn't fired?</font>

807
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

808
00:55:58,729 --> 00:56:00,315
<font color="yellow">Then what do we do?</font>

809
00:56:00,784 --> 00:56:04,463
<font color="yellow">If she's at the company,
she'll keep bumping into Mr. Kim!</font>

810
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,477
<font color="yellow">We'll have to come up with a different way.</font>

811
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:12,520
<font color="yellow">I'll kick her out of the
company somehow, so don't worry.</font>

812
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,588
<font color="yellow">Do it as soon as possible
with whatever method you can!</font>

813
00:56:16,284 --> 00:56:18,011
<font color="yellow">Or I'll get a heart disease.</font>

814
00:56:18,471 --> 00:56:22,377
<font color="yellow">Grandfather doesn't doubt me
as his real granddaughter.</font>

815
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:27,159
<font color="yellow">Make sure grandmother doesn't say
anything weird like last time, okay?</font>

816
00:56:28,425 --> 00:56:29,425
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

817
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,940
<font color="yellow">I'm going up.</font>

818
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:33,494
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

819
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,221
<font color="yellow">What happened to mom?</font>

820
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,745
<font color="yellow">She left with $20,000 and
I haven't heard from her since.</font>

821
00:56:47,753 --> 00:56:48,753
<font color="yellow">Is she...?</font>

822
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:55,690
<font color="yellow">The person you are trying
to each is unavailable.</font>

823
00:56:56,299 --> 00:57:01,580
<font color="yellow">Mom, please let me live! Please!</font>

824
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,338
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

825
00:57:05,657 --> 00:57:08,073
<font color="yellow">Dongah Cafe</font>

826
00:57:08,098 --> 00:57:09,098
<font color="yellow">Two hundred.</font>

827
00:57:10,437 --> 00:57:13,733
<font color="yellow">- Deal.
- Why are you guys coming on so strong? Sheesh.</font>

828
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:16,106
<font color="yellow">Is it jangttaeng?</font>

829
00:57:16,273 --> 00:57:17,773
<font color="yellow">Three eight kwangttaeng!</font>

830
00:57:19,164 --> 00:57:21,088
<font color="yellow">I'm so lucky!</font>

831
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:30,716
<font color="yellow">This is so delicious! The kimchi
is so refreshing and delicious!</font>

832
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:33,853
<font color="yellow">Your in-law is a really good cook.</font>

833
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:37,905
<font color="yellow">Last time I saw her at the wedding,
she had a nice figure</font>

834
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:41,226
<font color="yellow">like a young lady,
and she was very beautiful, too.</font>

835
00:57:41,983 --> 00:57:45,023
<font color="yellow">She looks pitiful, not beautiful.</font>

836
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:51,794
<font color="yellow">And glamorous bodies like mine
are the ones that men really love.</font>

837
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:55,374
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. Good for you.</font>

838
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,913
<font color="yellow">That's why Dal-ho can't go against me!</font>

839
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:02,667
<font color="yellow">Ma Chung-ja, don't say that anywhere else.</font>

840
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:04,957
<font color="yellow">They'll think you're nuts.</font>

841
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:06,289
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

842
00:58:07,632 --> 00:58:09,801
<font color="yellow">At our age, it's the best to hold hands and</font>

843
00:58:09,826 --> 00:58:12,141
<font color="yellow">take a walk while looking
at the autumn leaves.</font>

844
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:14,898
<font color="yellow">Says the widow.</font>

845
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:18,460
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- Stop it. You'll fight again.</font>

846
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:23,638
<font color="yellow">Anyways, you'll be the only one in this
country who made your daughter-in-law</font>

847
00:58:23,663 --> 00:58:27,817
<font color="yellow">and her mother make kimchi for you and
shared it with the whole neighborhood.</font>

848
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:30,779
<font color="yellow">Yeah! Women these days
don't stand for such things.</font>

849
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:33,851
<font color="yellow">If you had asked other women
to make a hundred cabbages</font>

850
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:36,736
<font color="yellow">into kimchi, they would have
demanded a divorce right away.</font>

851
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:38,244
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

852
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:42,126
<font color="yellow">Stop hating your daughter-in-law
and be good to her now.</font>

853
00:58:48,377 --> 00:58:49,577
<font color="yellow">I'll bring coffee.</font>

854
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,431
<font color="yellow">Forcing her to make kimchi won't work.</font>

855
00:58:56,025 --> 00:59:01,259
<font color="yellow">What can I do to chase Mi-poong
and her family out of here?</font>

856
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:14,644
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I ordered a bunch of pumpkins,
and I'll give all of them to you.</font>

857
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:17,748
<font color="yellow">Pumpkins? Why?</font>

858
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:20,787
<font color="yellow">It's going to be even
more difficult to take off</font>

859
00:59:20,812 --> 00:59:23,069
<font color="yellow">the peels and cut them up than to make kimchi.</font>

860
00:59:23,654 --> 00:59:25,610
<font color="yellow">She'll hurt her wrists while doing it!</font>

861
00:59:26,405 --> 00:59:29,226
<font color="yellow">So tell your daughter-in-law
to take off the peels so</font>

862
00:59:29,251 --> 00:59:32,124
<font color="yellow">that she can make porridge and
rice cakes and dry the rest of them.</font>

863
00:59:34,374 --> 00:59:35,641
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja.
- Yeah?</font>

864
00:59:36,093 --> 00:59:39,959
<font color="yellow">I can hate her because
she's my daughter-in-law.</font>

865
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:43,514
<font color="yellow">But why are you so eager
to chase her out of here?</font>

866
00:59:45,185 --> 00:59:51,764
<font color="yellow">That's because you want to chase her out,
so I'm trying to help you.</font>

867
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:55,280
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You don't have to help me anymore.</font>

868
00:59:56,374 --> 00:59:59,358
<font color="yellow">What? I don't have to help you anymore?</font>

869
00:59:59,757 --> 01:00:00,757
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

870
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:03,874
<font color="yellow">It's not easy giving my daughter-in-law
a hard time with the housework.</font>

871
01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:09,045
<font color="yellow">And at this rate, Jang-go
and I will become enemies.</font>

872
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:15,514
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to chase Mi-poong
out and make Ha-yeon your daughter-in-law.</font>

873
01:00:16,249 --> 01:00:18,811
<font color="yellow">I was just saying that.
Do you think that's even possible?</font>

874
01:00:19,335 --> 01:00:25,263
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I'm an outcast in my family because
of you and those one hundred cabbages.</font>

875
01:00:26,921 --> 01:00:32,116
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to help you.
Sheesh. Forget it then!</font>

876
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,545
<font color="yellow">You came first.</font>

877
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,186
<font color="yellow">You came early as well.</font>

878
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:24,452
<font color="yellow">It's going to take a while for the others
to come. Should we wait for them inside?</font>

879
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:26,905
<font color="yellow">It's fine. They'll be here soon.</font>

880
01:01:35,038 --> 01:01:36,038
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

881
01:01:44,335 --> 01:01:45,827
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mr. Jo.</font>

882
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,186
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's fine. I'm okay.</font>

883
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:03,264
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the karaoke room.</font>

884
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:07,786
<font color="yellow">I can't go. I have to make dinner
for Dal-ho and Mr. Kim.</font>

885
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:11,211
<font color="yellow">The food was great,
and I had a lot of fun today.</font>

886
01:02:12,249 --> 01:02:14,254
<font color="yellow">Are you guys really
going to betray me like this?</font>

887
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,862
<font color="yellow">You widows can have a
grand time at the karaoke room.</font>

888
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:18,828
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, too.</font>

889
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:21,194
<font color="yellow">Look how that brat talks.</font>

890
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:24,952
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, how about us
widows go watch a movie?</font>

891
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:28,233
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that. I feel a
bit blue anyways. Let's go.</font>

892
01:02:34,436 --> 01:02:36,600
<font color="yellow">Why aren't they coming?
We'll be late at this rate.</font>

893
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:38,014
<font color="yellow">Should I call them?</font>

894
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,436
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo! Ms. Joo! I'm so sorry!</font>

895
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:45,091
<font color="yellow">What about Ms. Hong?</font>

896
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:48,439
<font color="yellow">She called me and told me that
someone in her family suddenly got sick,</font>

897
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,373
<font color="yellow">so that the three of us
should just go by ourselves.</font>

898
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,233
<font color="yellow">Really? Let's go inside then.</font>

899
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:59,334
<font color="yellow">I was running so quickly.
I'm going to drop by the restroom first.</font>

900
01:03:00,546 --> 01:03:01,546
<font color="yellow">Go ahead then.</font>

901
01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:05,928
<font color="yellow">- Let's go inside and choose.
- Okay.</font>

902
01:03:09,944 --> 01:03:12,170
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Chung-ja's husband?</font>

903
01:03:12,741 --> 01:03:13,741
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

904
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:15,218
<font color="yellow">He is, right?</font>

905
01:03:18,405 --> 01:03:20,739
<font color="yellow">He is Chung-ja's husband.</font>

906
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:23,412
<font color="yellow">But who is that woman next to him?</font>

907
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,780
<font color="yellow">Woman?</font>

908
01:03:25,811 --> 01:03:29,522
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh! He must be having an affair!
- No way.</font>

909
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:33,568
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, take pictures! No, I'll do it.</font>

910
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:35,687
<font color="yellow">- Don't!
- Hold still!</font>

911
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:36,712
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

912
01:03:41,608 --> 01:03:42,938
<font color="yellow">Should we wait inside?</font>

913
01:03:47,304 --> 01:03:50,616
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Isn't that your in-law?</font>

914
01:04:24,238 --> 01:04:25,959
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

915
01:04:25,984 --> 01:04:28,919
<font color="yellow">Don't get shocked. Dal-ho is having an affair!</font>

916
01:04:28,944 --> 01:04:30,504
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill them!</font>

917
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:33,725
<font color="yellow">You wench! How dare you flirt with my husband?</font>

918
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,450
<font color="yellow">Yes. Where? The police station?</font>

919
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:41,776
<font color="yellow">Hello, Geum-sil. I really wanted to see you.</font>

920
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:43,843
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

921
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:45,442
<font color="yellow">You home-wrecker!</font>

922
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:46,592
<font color="yellow">Are you done talking?</font>

923
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:48,765
<font color="yellow">You seem to be disrespecting Hee-ra.</font>

924
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,694
<font color="yellow">When did I disrespect her?</font>

925
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:53,342
<font color="yellow">Now your true colors are coming out!</font>

926
01:04:53,771 --> 01:04:55,069
<font color="yellow">- You brat!
- Mi-poong.</font>

927
01:04:55,094 --> 01:04:58,027
<font color="yellow">I'll rearrange the order of your ribs today!</font>
