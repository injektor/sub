<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 47)</font>

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,121
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, what do you think you're doing?</font>

4
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me yourself.</font>

5
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:16,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Yoo-jin your daughter? Is she?</font>

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:22,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought this was about something else.
Are you acting like this because of that?</font>

7
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,935
<font color=#FFFF00>You wicked wench! You dirty wench!</font>

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,571
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you hide your
child and marry Hee-dong?</font>

9
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:31,960
<font color=#FFFF00>You deserve to die! My kind
Hee-dong didn't know she was</font>

10
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:35,360
<font color=#FFFF00>your real daughter. He hugged,
carried, and played with her!</font>

11
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:39,831
<font color=#FFFF00>If I think about that, I won't be
able to rest in peace when I die!</font>

12
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,282
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Yoo-jin is my daughter.</font>

13
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,644
<font color=#FFFF00>But that was from the past
before I had met Hee-dong.</font>

14
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:53,006
<font color=#FFFF00>There isn't anyone without
a past in this world!</font>

15
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,675
<font color=#FFFF00>And did I have an affair while
I was living with Hee-dong?</font>

16
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,715
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you talk back!</font>

17
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:07,462
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare a nobody like you barge into
my home and break my son's heart!</font>

18
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:09,462
<font color=#FFFF00>You dirty wench!</font>

19
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to reveal that you're not
Mr. Kim's real granddaughter!</font>

20
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,009
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be the end for you!</font>

21
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:19,384
<font color=#FFFF00>Do whatever you want!</font>

22
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,654
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'll go down by myself?
You'll go down with me!</font>

23
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:26,169
<font color=#FFFF00>If I go under, do you think you'll be safe?</font>

24
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:29,962
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and reveal that I'm
an imposter if you can!</font>

25
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:34,736
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae is an imposter?</font>

26
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,346
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I die? Did I pretend
to be his granddaughter?</font>

27
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,079
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be struck by thunder!</font>

28
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you dare curse at me!</font>

29
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,666
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't deserve to curse at me!</font>

30
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,806
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll just...!</font>

31
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,667
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father.
- Mr. Kim.</font>

32
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:11,093
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father! Father!
- Ms. Ma! Ms. Ma!</font>

33
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,673
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

34
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:16,907
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, father collapsed!</font>

35
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:21,506
<font color=#FFFF00>Father! Father, open your eyes!</font>

36
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,531
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather! Dad, what's wrong with him?</font>

37
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:25,407
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather! Grandfather, wake up!</font>

38
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:27,462
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Call 119!</font>

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,704
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Kim!
- Dal-ho.</font>

40
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:35,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Kim!
- Is this 119? Please hurry up
and come here. Hurry!</font>

41
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,727
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father.
- Grandfather!</font>

42
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

43
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:03,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

44
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,541
<font color=#FFFF00>What? You have information
about James Kang?</font>

45
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:13,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone who fits James Kang's
description has showed up.</font>

46
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,478
<font color=#FFFF00>His name is Kang Kyeong-cheol,
and he's thirty-nine years old.</font>

47
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,977
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been in jail four times for fraud.
It seems</font>

48
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,153
<font color=#FFFF00>like he's the James Kang
you've been searching for.</font>

49
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:22,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is he right now?</font>

50
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:25,810
<font color=#FFFF00>He was witnessed in
Beijing not too long ago.</font>

51
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Beijing?
- Yes.</font>

52
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:33,159
<font color=#FFFF00>But someone else has sued him for fraud,
so they're still investigating him.</font>

53
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:36,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll contact you as soon as we catch him.</font>

54
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help me.</font>

55
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,142
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom!
- Yes?</font>

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,493
<font color=#FFFF00>- The samples of our frozen dumplings are out.
- Really?</font>

57
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,889
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope it'll taste right this time.</font>

58
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,095
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's hurry up and steam this,
so we can taste them.
- Okay.</font>

59
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow! It's delicious.</font>

60
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:18,303
<font color=#FFFF00>It tastes exactly like
your dumplings, grandma.</font>

61
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Do they really
taste the same, Yoo-sung?</font>

62
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,889
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yup!
- Mi-poong, what do you think?</font>

63
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,252
<font color=#FFFF00>I think they do taste similar.</font>

64
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:30,351
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not exactly the same as our
handmade dumplings, but it's similar.</font>

65
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:31,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes!</font>

66
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I think we'll be able to sell our
dumplings on home shopping now.</font>

67
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:42,136
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is it good?
- Mom, we should tell our customers to try some.</font>

68
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,161
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

69
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:51,821
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. This is for free. Please try them.</font>

70
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:54,431
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is this a new kind of dumplings?
- No, these are the</font>

71
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:56,857
<font color=#FFFF00>frozen dumplings that will be
sold on Rainbow Home Shopping.</font>

72
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:57,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really?</font>

73
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,527
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's so delicious.
- It's really good!</font>

74
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,552
<font color=#FFFF00>- It is?
- Yes.</font>

75
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:06,242
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't seem like frozen dumplings.</font>

76
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,152
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you.
- Enjoy.</font>

77
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,066
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

78
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

79
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:19,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

80
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:43,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim didn't faint after
he heard us talking, did he?</font>

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,714
<font color=#FFFF00>No, that's not it. He fainted
a lot of times before, too.</font>

82
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,534
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. He just fainted like last time.</font>

83
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,654
<font color=#FFFF00>If he had overheard
mother and me talking, he</font>

84
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,958
<font color=#FFFF00>would've barged into the
room and started screaming.</font>

85
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,962
<font color=#FFFF00>But that old man seems to be in
a critical condition this time.</font>

86
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:03,916
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

87
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,545
<font color=#FFFF00>If he passes away, then what
happens to all that inheritance?</font>

88
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,977
<font color=#FFFF00>That sly fox isn't even on
his family register yet.</font>

89
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:15,166
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that mean that idiot
gets the inheritance?</font>

90
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

91
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:25,056
<font color=#FFFF00>What happens if grandfather
passes away now?</font>

92
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,008
<font color=#FFFF00>What will I do?</font>

93
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:30,300
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I quickly get the
inheritance in my hands?</font>

94
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:34,846
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, why isn't my father coming out?</font>

95
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:39,165
<font color=#FFFF00>Please call the people who
took my father in there.</font>

96
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,609
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell them to bring my father out quickly!</font>

97
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,813
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, Mr. Kim fainted a few times,
but he has overcome all of them.</font>

98
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,337
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll be safe this time as well.
Just wait a little bit longer.</font>

99
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,991
<font color=#FFFF00>Will my father really be all right?</font>

100
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,016
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course!</font>

101
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, Dae-hoon!</font>

102
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, the surgery...?</font>

103
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:06,473
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to your quick response, the
cerebral hemorrhage surgery went well.</font>

104
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:10,524
<font color=#FFFF00>However, because this was a
spontaneous hemorrhage due to the</font>

105
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,013
<font color=#FFFF00>cardiovascular disorder that he
had, he's not completely safe yet.</font>

106
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Does he need another
cardiovascular surgery?</font>

107
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:20,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Anymore surgeries would overtax him.</font>

108
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:25,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr. Yang is doing his best in the cardiovascular
area, so let's wait for the results.</font>

109
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:27,493
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

110
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:55,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, didn't the doctor say
that the surgery had gone well?</font>

111
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:59,315
<font color=#FFFF00>But why isn't my father opening his eyes?</font>

112
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,538
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father, open your eyes. Father...
- Sir, you can't do this here.</font>

113
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,965
<font color=#FFFF00>The patient needs complete
rest, so only one person</font>

114
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,634
<font color=#FFFF00>should stay to take care
of him for the night.</font>

115
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:13,868
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

116
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:16,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

117
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:19,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Chung-ja, take Shin-ae and Dae-hoon
home with you. I'll stay here.</font>

118
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:20,143
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

119
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:24,524
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm not going to leave. I'm
going to stay here with father.</font>

120
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,766
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't cry.</font>

121
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,258
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't talk either.</font>

122
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,865
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't tell me to leave, Dal-ho. Please?</font>

123
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:38,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, go home with us. We
can come back tomorrow.</font>

124
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:41,071
<font color=#FFFF00>No! I'm never going to leave! Never!</font>

125
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:46,399
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to protect my father.</font>

126
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

127
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,953
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You can stay with me.</font>

128
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,754
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go home with Shin-ae.</font>

129
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:55,992
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

130
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,057
<font color=#FFFF00>This is for the better.</font>

131
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:27,454
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin,</font>

132
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,987
<font color=#FFFF00>from now on,</font>

133
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,517
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let you go through
a hard time by yourself.</font>

134
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:46,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather didn't hear everything
mother and I said, did he?</font>

135
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:50,485
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

136
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:58,456
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if he did, there are the DNA results,
so he won't suspect me as an imposter.</font>

137
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:06,384
<font color=#FFFF00>You terrible...</font>

138
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:15,695
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you, mother?</font>

139
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,400
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't want to humiliate yourself
in front of your daughter, follow me.</font>

140
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:29,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't even know what Hee-dong is doing
right now, but you're here with your child?</font>

141
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:35,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't even know who her father is, yet
you took care of her in my son's room!</font>

142
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,126
<font color=#FFFF00>You wicked thing!</font>

143
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:45,751
<font color=#FFFF00>It's enough that you tempted me and
made me do all the dirty, evil work!</font>

144
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:51,253
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you dirty my son's life as well?</font>

145
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:56,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, you should talk straight,
no matter what the situation is.</font>

146
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,624
<font color=#FFFF00>You teamed up with me because
you coveted grandfather's</font>

147
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,875
<font color=#FFFF00>inheritance! I never
tempted you into anything!</font>

148
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:03,258
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

149
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,462
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm letting you slide this time
because of Hee-dong, but if</font>

150
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:09,269
<font color=#FFFF00>you do something like this
again, I won't hold back then.</font>

151
00:11:09,696 --> 00:11:11,039
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't hold back anymore!</font>

152
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,907
<font color=#FFFF00>You imposter!</font>

153
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,501
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine!</font>

154
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:17,853
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do if you
can't hold back? What will you do?</font>

155
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:23,179
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't forgive a stubborn one like
you either, so get out of my house!</font>

156
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:26,581
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out! Get out! I said get out!</font>

157
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:29,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't leave!</font>

158
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,365
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you that I would
never leave this house as</font>

159
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,587
<font color=#FFFF00>long as I'm alive! I'll
never leave even if I die!</font>

160
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:43,014
<font color=#FFFF00>So if you don't want to
see me, you get out!</font>

161
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:45,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You!</font>

162
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:48,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the crazy one! I deserve to die!</font>

163
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:52,486
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the fool for being used
by a spiteful wench like her!</font>

164
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:56,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Who would I blame for this?</font>

165
00:11:57,135 --> 00:12:00,619
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness! My poor Hee-dong! What will I do?</font>

166
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:08,408
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness! My poor Hee-dong! What will I do?</font>

167
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:14,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out! Get out this instant!</font>

168
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:19,887
<font color=#FFFF00>The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</font>

169
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,201
<font color=#FFFF00>After the tone, please leave a message.</font>

170
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:24,369
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is Hee-dong's phone off?</font>

171
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,550
<font color=#FFFF00>How did he end up meeting a woman like her?</font>

172
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,416
<font color=#FFFF00>No, no. This is all my fault.</font>

173
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:42,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong won't be thinking about doing
something harmful to himself, will he?</font>

174
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:52,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, it's all my fault.</font>

175
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:55,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, so please hurry home.</font>

176
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, please rest here.</font>

177
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,206
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

178
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going to sleep.</font>

179
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:24,135
<font color=#FFFF00>Until my father wakes up,
I'm never going to sleep.</font>

180
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:26,549
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho.</font>

181
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,513
<font color=#FFFF00>You heard what the doctor said
when he dropped by earlier.</font>

182
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:37,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim underwent such a big surgery that
it'll take some time for him to wake up.</font>

183
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:40,642
<font color=#FFFF00>- So, Dae-hoon...
- Father, I'm sorry.</font>

184
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:47,173
<font color=#FFFF00>If only I hadn't called you, you
wouldn't have collapsed like this.</font>

185
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:51,070
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all my fault.</font>

186
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,008
<font color=#FFFF00>A call?</font>

187
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:57,250
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you call him about?</font>

188
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:06,542
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is, today, Hee-dong found out
that Yoo-jin is Shin-ae's daughter.</font>

189
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:09,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

190
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:13,661
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong said he was going
to get a divorce, so I</font>

191
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,592
<font color=#FFFF00>called my father to tell
him to stop Hee-dong.</font>

192
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,492
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why my father collapsed.</font>

193
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,594
<font color=#FFFF00>Because he was shocked.</font>

194
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:29,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, Yoo-jin is Shin-ae's daughter?</font>

195
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

196
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:36,998
<font color=#FFFF00>So then Hee-dong said
he would get a divorce?</font>

197
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:39,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

198
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:09,047
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

199
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:10,891
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, sir.</font>

200
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:15,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, thank you.</font>

201
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,930
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

202
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,945
<font color=#FFFF00>(Missed Calls)</font>

203
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, your grandfather-in-law
has collapsed.</font>

204
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:41,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, dad? What do you
mean grandfather collapsed?</font>

205
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:46,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong.</font>

206
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:52,336
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you get that ring?
I never saw it before.</font>

207
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:58,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Jang-go give it to you?</font>

208
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, mom.</font>

209
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,126
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

210
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,477
<font color=#FFFF00>So you decided to not get divorced?</font>

211
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what else do I do?</font>

212
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:13,166
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go sticks to my side
like gum and won't leave.</font>

213
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:18,566
<font color=#FFFF00>Good. You made the right
decision, Mi-poong.</font>

214
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,782
<font color=#FFFF00>When the consideration period
ended at the end of this month,</font>

215
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,473
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you would go to
court again, so I was scared.</font>

216
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:33,304
<font color=#FFFF00>But mom, I don't know if I'm really
doing the right thing or not.</font>

217
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:36,425
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother-in-law still doesn't accept me.</font>

218
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,701
<font color=#FFFF00>You did the right thing. When
your mother-in-law sees you and</font>

219
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:43,186
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go living happily together,
she'll open up her heart one day.</font>

220
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,326
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother! Yoo-sung!</font>

221
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Speaking of the devil...</font>

222
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,065
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that Jang-go?</font>

223
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,147
<font color=#FFFF00>It's cold!</font>

224
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:07,439
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome, Jang-go! It's cold outside,
isn't it? Did you eat dinner yet?</font>

225
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,039
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so cold, mother.</font>

226
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:13,365
<font color=#FFFF00>But did something good happen?</font>

227
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:14,904
<font color=#FFFF00>You look really happy.</font>

228
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,458
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really? Was it obvious?</font>

229
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:18,761
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course!</font>

230
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:20,521
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

231
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:26,839
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, thank you for changing
Mi-poong's mind. Thank you so much.</font>

232
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,964
<font color=#FFFF00>I should be the one who
is more grateful to you.</font>

233
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:32,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though I come here every
day, you always welcome me.</font>

234
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,157
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I brought your
favorite strawberries.</font>

235
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:37,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mi-poong.</font>

236
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:39,114
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Yoo-sung?</font>

237
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:40,722
<font color=#FFFF00>He's asleep.</font>

238
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:45,185
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here at this hour?
You should go home early and sleep.</font>

239
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,620
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Mother, you heard her, didn't you?</font>

240
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Please scold her!</font>

241
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You little...!</font>

242
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,995
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jang-go, have a seat.
- Okay.</font>

243
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,305
<font color=#FFFF00>How does it taste?</font>

244
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,210
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so delicious.</font>

245
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:21,925
<font color=#FFFF00>These are really the frozen
dumplings from the factory?</font>

246
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,817
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I brought them from the factory today.</font>

247
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:27,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow! Mother, I can see these are
going to be a big hit already.</font>

248
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,917
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? Are they really delicious?
- Yes, they are!</font>

249
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:35,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get the broadcast date?</font>

250
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,181
<font color=#FFFF00>This Friday at 5:00 p.m.</font>

251
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:40,513
<font color=#FFFF00>Friday at 5:00 p.m?</font>

252
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:45,045
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the time when people would be hungry.
It's a good time.</font>

253
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,134
<font color=#FFFF00>But will the factory be able to
meet the supply demands by Friday?</font>

254
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:53,752
<font color=#FFFF00>The factory manager said he would
do whatever he can to meet them.</font>

255
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,894
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, poor Mi-poong. You'll have to live
in the factory for the time being.</font>

256
00:18:58,378 --> 00:18:59,589
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm worried.</font>

257
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:03,113
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother will have a hard
time at the diner by herself.</font>

258
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,926
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh,dear.Don't worry about me.</font>

259
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:07,323
<font color=#FFFF00>I can manage alone.</font>

260
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,113
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you alone?</font>

261
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:12,878
<font color=#FFFF00>You have me. When I'm done with
work, I'll come to the diner.</font>

262
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,946
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, no. I can do it by myself.
Don't worry about it.</font>

263
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I'm really fine.</font>

264
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Use me like I'm your servant!</font>

265
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,542
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, Jang-go. Thank you
for your kind words.</font>

266
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, this is really good.</font>

267
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,409
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you need to tell me?</font>

268
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,089
<font color=#FFFF00>The police caught James Kang.</font>

269
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,198
<font color=#FFFF00>- James Kang?
- Yes.</font>

270
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,526
<font color=#FFFF00>You mean the con-artist who said
he had bought my designs from me?</font>

271
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:53,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

272
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,675
<font color=#FFFF00>He was spotted in China. He's being investigated
right now, so just wait a little bit.</font>

273
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,331
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go...</font>

274
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,487
<font color=#FFFF00>were you investigating this all this time?</font>

275
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

276
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:08,386
<font color=#FFFF00>I promised you I would
prove your innocence.</font>

277
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:10,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, thank you.</font>

278
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:20,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What's up with you?
You're hugging me first.</font>

279
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:24,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just grateful to you for everything.</font>

280
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,823
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't live without me, huh?</font>

281
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:33,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Then don't just express
yourself with just words.</font>

282
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,815
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

283
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,285
<font color=#FFFF00>You got a call.</font>

284
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have to answer it. Hurry!</font>

285
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,354
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pucker your lips whenever you want.
Just quickly answer your phone.</font>

286
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Who is calling me
during this important time?</font>

287
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello? This is Lee Jang-go.</font>

288
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,517
<font color=#FFFF00>You sent the contract?</font>

289
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,415
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll check it.</font>

290
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,206
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

291
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:09,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

292
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:11,995
<font color=#FFFF00>It sounded like a woman.</font>

293
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:15,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I'm doing legal advice
for her as my mom's request.</font>

294
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:20,392
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Are you jealous?</font>

295
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, right.</font>

296
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,375
<font color=#FFFF00>It's late, so go home!</font>

297
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,796
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll go. Why do
you keep telling me to go?</font>

298
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,044
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go after we finish what we started.</font>

299
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,822
<font color=#FFFF00>Finish what?</font>

300
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,205
<font color=#FFFF00>What else?</font>

301
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:38,376
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and go home.</font>

302
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:45,877
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I just had to get
a call at this time.</font>

303
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:48,087
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too bad.</font>

304
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:56,149
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm home.
- Jang-go, why are you so late?
What about dinner?</font>

305
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:58,333
<font color=#FFFF00>- I already ate.
- Wait, Jang-go.</font>

306
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,127
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

307
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:04,993
<font color=#FFFF00>About Dr. Yoon...</font>

308
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:08,377
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have given her
great legal counseling</font>

309
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:11,041
<font color=#FFFF00>because she called
Ms. Lee to say thank you.</font>

310
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I did?</font>

311
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:16,368
<font color=#FFFF00>She didn't even bring the contract,
so I didn't do anything for her.</font>

312
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,402
<font color=#FFFF00>She didn't bring the contract?</font>

313
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:21,503
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you'll have to meet her
again with the contract.</font>

314
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,828
<font color=#FFFF00>She sent it to me by e-mail,
so I said I'd check it.</font>

315
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:28,017
<font color=#FFFF00>Good. Check it carefully and
give her good legal advice.</font>

316
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:31,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't treat her in such
a business-like manner.</font>

317
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,462
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat dinner and drink tea
with her, too. Okay?</font>

318
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should I go that far?</font>

319
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, did you...?</font>

320
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:42,722
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I what?</font>

321
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:46,954
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying. This is my
friend's request, so you should</font>

322
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,954
<font color=#FFFF00>be extra nice to Dr. Yoon so
that I won't be embarrassed.</font>

323
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:53,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Be good to her for my sake.</font>

324
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,056
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll be going in now.</font>

325
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:16,970
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true that Yoo-jin
is Shin-ae's daughter?</font>

326
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,166
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

327
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,322
<font color=#FFFF00>How...?</font>

328
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,845
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't think Shin-ae was like that.</font>

329
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,672
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she deceive the
entire family all this time?</font>

330
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:34,369
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

331
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:37,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin calls Shin-ae her aunt.</font>

332
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,134
<font color=#FFFF00>Then Yoo-jin doesn't know
that Shin-ae is her mom?</font>

333
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,876
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Yoo-jin know everything, too?</font>

334
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:49,540
<font color=#FFFF00>She knew and pretended
Shin-ae wasn't her mom?</font>

335
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:54,884
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't enough that she
deceived you from the beginning.</font>

336
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:59,470
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't like she secretly hid Yoo-jin.
She lived with Yoo-jin.</font>

337
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,087
<font color=#FFFF00>Yet, how could she make
that child lie like that?</font>

338
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:08,556
<font color=#FFFF00>About Shin-ae's DNA test...</font>

339
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:11,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you tell your wife about it?</font>

340
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he tell me to come
home to tell me this?</font>

341
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,603
<font color=#FFFF00>But why did he suddenly
bring up the DNA test?</font>

342
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:21,251
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

343
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:23,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Huh?</font>

344
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,626
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, it's nothing.</font>

345
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:38,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

346
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,001
<font color=#FFFF00>you promised to live with
me for a long, long time.</font>

347
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,376
<font color=#FFFF00>So please don't die.</font>

348
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:59,524
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't die, just like mother did. Okay?</font>

349
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:04,173
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother,</font>

350
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:07,790
<font color=#FFFF00>please save father.</font>

351
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:11,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Father is very sick.</font>

352
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:18,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, you'll save him, won't you?</font>

353
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,017
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother...</font>

354
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:24,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

355
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:42,407
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't bring myself under
in order to drag her down.</font>

356
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:45,164
<font color=#FFFF00>Then it'd be too unfair.</font>

357
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:46,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Right!</font>

358
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:08,751
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

359
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:10,490
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk.</font>

360
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,849
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to drink the tea?
I just made it.</font>

361
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:37,431
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't put any poison in
it, so you can drink it.</font>

362
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:41,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I know what you're going to say.</font>

363
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,782
<font color=#FFFF00>You do? You're quick-witted.</font>

364
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry for deceiving you
and Hee-dong all this time.</font>

365
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:55,923
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no choice to do that because I love
Hee-dong and I didn't want to hurt him.</font>

366
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:58,911
<font color=#FFFF00>I truly do love Hee-dong.</font>

367
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:00,158
<font color=#FFFF00>Love?</font>

368
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,381
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you love him?</font>

369
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Love...</font>

370
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I say I wanted to hear that from you?</font>

371
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,829
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you say you love Hee-dong!</font>

372
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:17,212
<font color=#FFFF00>I dare you to say such
a thing one more time!</font>

373
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:23,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you bring in another man's child into
Hee-dong's life because you loved him?</font>

374
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,024
<font color=#FFFF00>Love? Love!</font>

375
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:27,736
<font color=#FFFF00>You little...</font>

376
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:35,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's be honest.</font>

377
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:42,415
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

378
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:45,186
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and talk.</font>

379
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:49,439
<font color=#FFFF00>You frightening nine-tailed fox!</font>

380
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:52,235
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to make a deal
with me, don't curse at me.</font>

381
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

382
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,204
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, since things turned out this way,</font>

383
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,595
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll allow Yoo-jin to live in this house.</font>

384
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,087
<font color=#FFFF00>However, you can never adopt
her under Hee-dong's name.</font>

385
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:08,533
<font color=#FFFF00>Got that?</font>

386
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:13,961
<font color=#FFFF00>And once you become the
heiress of Winner's Group,</font>

387
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:18,892
<font color=#FFFF00>all of the inheritance will
be divided exactly in half.</font>

388
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:25,835
<font color=#FFFF00>If you agree, I'll keep
my mouth shut until then.</font>

389
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:28,314
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't agree...</font>

390
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,595
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll reveal everything.</font>

391
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:33,954
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you choose?</font>

392
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,517
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

393
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,759
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll do that.</font>

394
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,220
<font color=#FFFF00>It's great that you're cool about this.</font>

395
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:46,087
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's write a contract.</font>

396
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,227
<font color=#FFFF00>A contract?</font>

397
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:48,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

398
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:51,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I just trust your words?</font>

399
00:28:58,118 --> 00:28:59,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

400
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:17,689
<font color=#FFFF00>You better be careful so
that you won't get caught.</font>

401
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Speak for yourself.</font>

402
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
<font color=#FFFF00>"The Contract."</font>

403
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,314
<font color=#FFFF00>"Superior: Ma Chung-ja."</font>

404
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:40,072
<font color=#FFFF00>"The superior will get
half of the inheritance."</font>

405
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness!</font>

406
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,126
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've done this sooner!</font>

407
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:50,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, take your father-in-law to eat.</font>

408
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:51,939
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stay here.</font>

409
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:54,212
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

410
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, you should eat.</font>

411
00:29:57,954 --> 00:30:00,626
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay. I'm not hungry.</font>

412
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:03,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, you'll get sick at this rate.</font>

413
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:08,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Go eat with Hee-dong. I'll stay
here, so you don't have to worry.</font>

414
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,478
<font color=#FFFF00>The two of you can go eat.</font>

415
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,571
<font color=#FFFF00>- Doctor, why isn't my father waking up?
- Yesterday, you said the surgery went well.</font>

416
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:28,496
<font color=#FFFF00>There are some cases of patients who undergo
brain surgery to gain conscious late.</font>

417
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:31,151
<font color=#FFFF00>It might also be because of his old age.</font>

418
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,142
<font color=#FFFF00>For now, let's wait and see.</font>

419
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:35,908
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, doctor.</font>

420
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:46,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, what if my father doesn't wake up?</font>

421
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:48,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

422
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:53,462
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, Hee-dong!</font>

423
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:57,696
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you come here? Do you
know how worried I was about you?</font>

424
00:30:58,478 --> 00:30:59,611
<font color=#FFFF00>I came yesterday.</font>

425
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,267
<font color=#FFFF00>But Mr. Kim hasn't woken up yet?</font>

426
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:09,384
<font color=#FFFF00>The surgery went well, so
why isn't he waking up yet?</font>

427
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,556
<font color=#FFFF00>This happens sometimes for patients
who went through brain surgery.</font>

428
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,857
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right! My friend's
mom went through brain</font>

429
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,203
<font color=#FFFF00>surgery last time and didn't
wake up for ten days!</font>

430
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,291
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather...</font>

431
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:30,404
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk.</font>

432
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:39,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know?</font>

433
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:45,064
<font color=#FFFF00>That Yoo-jin was Shin-ae's daughter?</font>

434
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:48,511
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know either.</font>

435
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:52,142
<font color=#FFFF00>How would I know something
you didn't know about?</font>

436
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:56,254
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Hee-dong tell you he
would get a divorce, too?</font>

437
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,867
<font color=#FFFF00>When I think about how
Shin-ae deceived us and</font>

438
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:06,806
<font color=#FFFF00>made us into fools, I
get extremely furious,</font>

439
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,493
<font color=#FFFF00>but isn't divorce the wrong answer?</font>

440
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:13,212
<font color=#FFFF00>She lied like nothing was wrong.
We don't know</font>

441
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,914
<font color=#FFFF00>what she'll lie about next.
We can't trust her.</font>

442
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. If she wasn't
Mr. Kim's granddaughter...</font>

443
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:22,728
<font color=#FFFF00>But thinking about it from
a woman's point-of-view,</font>

444
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:25,134
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess I can understand why she did that.</font>

445
00:32:26,017 --> 00:32:30,282
<font color=#FFFF00>She did that because she liked Hee-dong
but was afraid to disappoint him.</font>

446
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,516
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, we should at least understand her.</font>

447
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong got very hurt this time.</font>

448
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Time will heal all the pain.</font>

449
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:42,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, they can't get a divorce.</font>

450
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:46,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get in the way. Let
Hee-dong take care of it.</font>

451
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:47,954
<font color=#FFFF00>Still!</font>

452
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,439
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to bring clothes for Dae-hoon
and me. Did you come empty-handed?</font>

453
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no. I forgot.</font>

454
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,884
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's your head?</font>

455
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I'll go bring it right now.</font>

456
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:02,360
<font color=#FFFF00>The kids can never get a divorce. Okay?</font>

457
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:16,946
<font color=#FFFF00>It's that ring. The ring
that Jang-go gave you.</font>

458
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,587
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take that ring out no matter what.</font>

459
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:28,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness. She's such a headache.</font>

460
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:34,431
<font color=#FFFF00>She better not block
Jang-go's future this time.</font>

461
00:33:34,456 --> 00:33:35,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil.</font>

462
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:39,071
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

463
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:43,462
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil, I'm going to rest here.</font>

464
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,603
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness. I'm so exhausted.</font>

465
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,515
<font color=#FFFF00>What would you be exhausted about?
Does your</font>

466
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,096
<font color=#FFFF00>son or daughter-in-law
give you a hard time?</font>

467
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,536
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no one else with
a better life than you.</font>

468
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:58,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm sorry for complaining when
I have a better life than everyone.</font>

469
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,970
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

470
00:34:00,783 --> 00:34:02,392
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you fight with your husband again?</font>

471
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:06,134
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim collapsed.</font>

472
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Is he okay?</font>

473
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,295
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't know yet.</font>

474
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:16,556
<font color=#FFFF00>He had a surgery for a brain
hemorrhage, but he didn't wake up yet.</font>

475
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:19,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I should go visit him
with my mother-in-law.</font>

476
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:23,008
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to do that? Then we
can go together in my car later.</font>

477
00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:25,009
<font color=#FFFF00>That's great. It's cold outside.</font>

478
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,907
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil, I'm hungry. Do
you have anything to eat?</font>

479
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:35,962
<font color=#FFFF00>All I had was a cup of coffee
in the morning, so I'm dizzy.</font>

480
00:34:36,423 --> 00:34:38,314
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't eat anything yet?</font>

481
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,407
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes.
- Oh, my. Hold on.</font>

482
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,431
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness.</font>

483
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:49,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at this beef stock.</font>

484
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, where are these dumplings from?
They're delicious.</font>

485
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:57,238
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you make them?
- No, Mi-poong did.</font>

486
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,717
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you said it's delicious, I
guess it really is delicious.</font>

487
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:05,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Their diner became famous, and now
they're appearing on home shopping.</font>

488
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:07,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Home shopping?</font>

489
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:12,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. They're going to appear on home shopping
to sell dumplings and find her father.</font>

490
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:13,931
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

491
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Find her father?</font>

492
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:19,595
<font color=#FFFF00>Won't home shopping be broadcasted
all over the country?</font>

493
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,033
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

494
00:35:21,908 --> 00:35:24,376
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw her father when I was in Macau, too.</font>

495
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:28,858
<font color=#FFFF00>They were living well there. Why did they
have to escape and get connected with us?</font>

496
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:35,412
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness.
- Wait a minute. Geum-sil, did you
see her father's face, too?</font>

497
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:38,483
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Jang-go and Mi-poong
went to the same school.</font>

498
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:44,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Her dad had these big and bright eyes. When
I see him, I'll notice him right away.</font>

499
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

500
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,900
<font color=#FFFF00>You came again.</font>

501
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:51,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad you're here.</font>

502
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim collapsed. You're going to
visit him at the hospital, aren't you?</font>

503
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,004
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, he did? Then of course I should go.</font>

504
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:00,904
<font color=#FFFF00>We can go in my friend's car.</font>

505
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,064
<font color=#FFFF00>That's great. It's cold outside.
Excuse us, please.</font>

506
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:06,306
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil, I need to go. There's
an emergency I must take care of.</font>

507
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,954
<font color=#FFFF00>Chung-ja, we're supposed to go
with you to visit the hospital.</font>

508
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:12,673
<font color=#FFFF00>No, don't come. It's cold.</font>

509
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:18,215
<font color=#FFFF00>- We have many visitors at the hospital.
Don't come, okay? Don't come!
- Chung-ja.</font>

510
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,571
<font color=#FFFF00>We should just go together. What's wrong?</font>

511
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't come!</font>

512
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,100
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with her, mother?</font>

513
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. She's a strange one.</font>

514
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,704
<font color=#FFFF00>She has a few screws loose in her head.</font>

515
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,103
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

516
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:38,767
<font color=#FFFF00>All of us hope that
Mr. Kim will recover soon.</font>

517
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:40,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for coming.</font>

518
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:43,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

519
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:48,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Going down.</font>

520
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:54,216
<font color=#FFFF00>First floor. The doors are closing.</font>

521
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,173
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

522
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,119
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

523
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:08,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather is family to me, too.</font>

524
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:14,235
<font color=#FFFF00>I came for him, not for you,
so don't get any thoughts.</font>

525
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:15,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

526
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:18,853
<font color=#FFFF00>You probably don't want
to see me right now.</font>

527
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,126
<font color=#FFFF00>However, aside from everything else,</font>

528
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:24,750
<font color=#FFFF00>stay by my side, for the sake
of grandfather and Yoo-jin.</font>

529
00:37:28,977 --> 00:37:30,454
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm begging you.</font>

530
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:40,907
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll talk about our issue
once grandfather wakes up.</font>

531
00:37:58,759 --> 00:37:59,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, mother.</font>

532
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:02,062
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you right now?</font>

533
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,564
<font color=#FFFF00>We're in big trouble!</font>

534
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Big trouble?</font>

535
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:12,158
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother!</font>

536
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:19,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that Mi-poong is going to
search for her dad on home shopping?</font>

537
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,142
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I heard.</font>

538
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:24,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Home shopping is broadcasted all
over the country, isn't it?</font>

539
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,763
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not the problem right now.
Geum-sil said</font>

540
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,083
<font color=#FFFF00>she knows what Mi-poong's dad looks like.</font>

541
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:31,696
<font color=#FFFF00>Her family said they would
come visit the hospital.</font>

542
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:34,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't that idiot not
be in the hospital then?</font>

543
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:38,071
<font color=#FFFF00>If Geum-sil sees him, it's game over!</font>

544
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:43,314
<font color=#FFFF00>What do we do?</font>

545
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:49,900
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pork made 100% in Korea.
- Along with beef made 100% in Korea.</font>

546
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:57,321
<font color=#FFFF00>- They're excellently mixed in
a perfect ratio along with...
- Wow. Looks delicious.</font>

547
00:38:57,346 --> 00:39:01,024
<font color=#FFFF00>This is soft and delicious
grilled short rib patties.</font>

548
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:04,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, when are you going to wake up?</font>

549
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:08,915
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and wake up so that
you can buy me that. Please?</font>

550
00:39:12,556 --> 00:39:16,524
<font color=#FFFF00>South Korea has many interesting shows.</font>

551
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:22,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Home shopping!</font>

552
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:27,735
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Why did you turn that off?</font>

553
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:30,091
<font color=#FFFF00>I was watching that right now!</font>

554
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:33,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, why would you watch home shopping?
It's no fun.</font>

555
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:35,939
<font color=#FFFF00>Why else would I watch it?
Because it's fun.</font>

556
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:39,858
<font color=#FFFF00>When I see food with my eyes, it feels
like I'm eating it, so I get happy.</font>

557
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,633
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and turn it back on.</font>

558
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, let's go out. I'll buy you
grilled short rib patties.</font>

559
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:49,986
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

560
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I can never leave father alone.</font>

561
00:39:53,387 --> 00:39:57,795
<font color=#FFFF00>My father-in-law and Hee-dong are
going to come back in a bit.</font>

562
00:39:58,715 --> 00:40:01,396
<font color=#FFFF00>They're going to come right back
after they pay the hospital fee.</font>

563
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:06,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Dae-hoon. I'll stay here, so go and eat
grilled short rib patties with Shin-ae.</font>

564
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:13,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Grilled short rib patties just melt
in your mouth! They're so delicious!</font>

565
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:19,261
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm just going to watch
TV and stay with father.</font>

566
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:22,712
<font color=#FFFF00>I had bread a while ago,
so I'm not hungry at all.</font>

567
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, come with me.</font>

568
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:30,143
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to eat them! So why
do you keep trying to take me?</font>

569
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really not going to listen to me?</font>

570
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:36,373
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you that I wouldn't let you
go if you don't listen to me.</font>

571
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:40,019
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, why are you doing this again?</font>

572
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:44,808
<font color=#FFFF00>You promised to not act
like this to me again.</font>

573
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:47,521
<font color=#FFFF00>My father is listening
to everything right now.</font>

574
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:51,097
<font color=#FFFF00>When my father gets up, I'm not going
to let you get away with this.</font>

575
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:03,435
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, to be honest, it's because of Yoo-jin.</font>

576
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin?</font>

577
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:06,902
<font color=#FFFF00>What about her?</font>

578
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:09,503
<font color=#FFFF00>She's sick.</font>

579
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:15,802
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm not bringing her
here, but she wants to see you.</font>

580
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:17,758
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin is sick?</font>

581
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

582
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:21,456
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

583
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:24,847
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

584
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:30,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, I'm going to go home for a bit.</font>

585
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,706
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to see Yoo-jin
and come back soon.</font>

586
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:38,331
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, let's go.</font>

587
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:42,878
<font color=#FFFF00>See you later.</font>

588
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,985
<font color=#FFFF00>He's easy to coax because
he's like a child.</font>

589
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:54,461
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. That was close.
Gosh. Now I can live.</font>

590
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:15,346
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yoo-jin! Yoo-jin! Yoo-jin!
- Yoo-jin isn't back from school yet.</font>

591
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't she sick?</font>

592
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:25,558
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, she must have felt
better and went to school.</font>

593
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,798
<font color=#FFFF00>She went to school, so why did
you lie that she was sick?</font>

594
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,557
<font color=#FFFF00>No, dad. I didn't lie.</font>

595
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:36,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin was sick earlier, wasn't she?</font>

596
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:38,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes...</font>

597
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,356
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go back to the hospital.
Hurry up and take me back to my father.</font>

598
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,621
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry!</font>

599
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:48,285
<font color=#FFFF00>When Yoo-jin comes home, play with her.
Then I'll take you there after work.</font>

600
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,179
<font color=#FFFF00>No! I'm going to go there right now!</font>

601
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:53,019
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go to my father!</font>

602
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:55,066
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go by myself.</font>

603
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:59,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I have the card, so I can
take a taxi by myself.</font>

604
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,342
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, what's wrong with you?</font>

605
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, why are you doing this again?</font>

606
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,357
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's mine, so give it back.
- Go to your room right now!</font>

607
00:43:11,785 --> 00:43:12,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Right this minute!</font>

608
00:43:14,543 --> 00:43:18,066
<font color=#FFFF00>O-Okay...</font>

609
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay here until I come back from work!</font>

610
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:25,199
<font color=#FFFF00>- You got it?
- Y-Yes...</font>

611
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:31,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you watch my dad so
that he doesn't go anywhere.</font>

612
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:33,128
<font color=#FFFF00>All right...</font>

613
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:42,917
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what's wrong with her?</font>

614
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:47,143
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter if he lost his memory
and became a child. He's still her dad!</font>

615
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:49,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't she being too mean?</font>

616
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,972
<font color=#FFFF00>That evil witch!</font>

617
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae definitely isn't my daughter.</font>

618
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:03,769
<font color=#FFFF00>When father wakes up, I'm
going to tell him everything!</font>

619
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:08,566
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

620
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,666
<font color=#FFFF00>hurry up and wake up.</font>

621
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:13,706
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

622
00:44:22,815 --> 00:44:26,149
<font color=#FFFF00>Our produce are great! You
can trust and use them.</font>

623
00:44:32,479 --> 00:44:35,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, we can't use these.</font>

624
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:39,198
<font color=#FFFF00>It might be troublesome, but please
take this back and bring us a new one.</font>

625
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,428
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why?
- What do you mean why?</font>

626
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,854
<font color=#FFFF00>Look. The tails are festered, and
the heads are turning yellow.</font>

627
00:44:47,026 --> 00:44:50,198
<font color=#FFFF00>No. That can't be. They were
just picked last night.</font>

628
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:55,324
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. I don't know what happened,
but these bean sprouts are old.</font>

629
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:59,225
<font color=#FFFF00>If we use these, the dumplings will
smell and be too tough to eat.</font>

630
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:01,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. You're being too picky.</font>

631
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:04,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone else just let it slide.</font>

632
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:08,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know about other places,
but we can't use such produce.</font>

633
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:10,677
<font color=#FFFF00>Half of the taste comes from ingredients.</font>

634
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:14,206
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if we have to pay more,
please bring us the best produce.</font>

635
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:17,662
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll be back in an hour.</font>

636
00:45:18,077 --> 00:45:20,021
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Please bring us your best.</font>

637
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, I'm going to check very thoroughly.</font>

638
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:26,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Please bring us clean, fresh bean sprouts.</font>

639
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:27,499
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

640
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:28,803
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

641
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:32,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you be able to meet the
supply demand by this Friday?</font>

642
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,820
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to worry about such a thing.
All the factory machines</font>

643
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:39,041
<font color=#FFFF00>are fully working on dumplings,
so that shouldn't be a problem.</font>

644
00:45:39,928 --> 00:45:41,861
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there any way we can help?</font>

645
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:44,381
<font color=#FFFF00>The dumpling recipe has been finalized.</font>

646
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:48,592
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll call you if anything happens, so
just make sure you answer your phone.</font>

647
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about that.
We'll be ready 24/7.</font>

648
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:54,763
<font color=#FFFF00>When you call us, we'll be here right away.</font>

649
00:45:55,944 --> 00:45:58,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Then we'll put our faith in you.</font>

650
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure? It's this week?</font>

651
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:05,922
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure. It's scheduled to be
on air this Friday at 5:00 p.m.</font>

652
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:12,803
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Heo, don't ask me why. You need to stop
Kim Mi-poong's program from going on air.</font>

653
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:17,646
<font color=#FFFF00>If the program is aired, you
and I are both screwed.</font>

654
00:46:17,913 --> 00:46:19,881
<font color=#FFFF00>So stop it no matter what!</font>

655
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:23,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'll block the program
using whatever means I can.</font>

656
00:46:29,405 --> 00:46:31,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I have visited the hospital, too?</font>

657
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:33,513
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have brought me with you.</font>

658
00:46:34,444 --> 00:46:36,826
<font color=#FFFF00>You're working here.</font>

659
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:39,287
<font color=#FFFF00>I went, so it's fine.</font>

660
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:41,603
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Poor old man.</font>

661
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:46,693
<font color=#FFFF00>He found his son and granddaughter. It would
be nice if he lived happily with them.</font>

662
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:51,084
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you think he'll pass away?
- How would I know that?</font>

663
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:54,826
<font color=#FFFF00>The heavens choose the man's fate.</font>

664
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:57,861
<font color=#FFFF00>If he's destined to live, he'll
live no matter what. If he's</font>

665
00:46:57,886 --> 00:47:00,671
<font color=#FFFF00>destined to die, he'll die no matter what.
That's what life is.</font>

666
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,389
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about time for Mr. Kim to come.</font>

667
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:09,111
<font color=#FFFF00>But why are you still here?</font>

668
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:13,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you were going to end things with
him because he ate your proposal ring.</font>

669
00:47:14,397 --> 00:47:15,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided not to.</font>

670
00:47:16,428 --> 00:47:17,628
<font color=#FFFF00>He found the ring.</font>

671
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:19,022
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

672
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,519
<font color=#FFFF00>He found the ring?</font>

673
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:24,670
<font color=#FFFF00>How did he find the ring that he ate?</font>

674
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:26,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I don't know. Don't ask me.</font>

675
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:32,215
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. So it went in here
and went out there...</font>

676
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:34,864
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my god. How repulsive!</font>

677
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:36,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't think about it, mom!</font>

678
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:38,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Nam-yi!</font>

679
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:40,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, ma'am.</font>

680
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:43,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Nam-yi, I brought your favorite ice cream.</font>

681
00:47:55,249 --> 00:48:00,867
<font color=#FFFF00>But if Mr. Kim passes away, what will
happen to that enormous inheritance?</font>

682
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:04,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Will it be given to his granddaughter
who is Chung-ja's daughter-in-law?</font>

683
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:06,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. He found his son.</font>

684
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:09,631
<font color=#FFFF00>His son is alive, so how can it
be given to his granddaughter?</font>

685
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:12,920
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right! He had a son! I forgot.</font>

686
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:15,959
<font color=#FFFF00>But I didn't see his son
in the hospital room.</font>

687
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:21,568
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is, Mr. Kim's son has
a bit of a mental problem.</font>

688
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:22,866
<font color=#FFFF00>What problem?</font>

689
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:24,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Pretend you don't know anything.</font>

690
00:48:24,788 --> 00:48:29,482
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is, Mr. Kim's
son's mind comes and goes.</font>

691
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:32,717
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of the trauma he
received from the gunshot while</font>

692
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,869
<font color=#FFFF00>escaping, he lost his memories
and thinks he's ten-years-old.</font>

693
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:37,829
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my goodness!
- Oh my goodness!</font>

694
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:41,115
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why Chung-ja is about to go mad!</font>

695
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:46,379
<font color=#FFFF00>He's an old man with white hair, but
he acts like a ten-year-old kid.</font>

696
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:53,379
<font color=#FFFF00>He acts like he's the owner of that house
and gives Chung-ja such a hard time!</font>

697
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:57,991
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

698
00:48:58,194 --> 00:49:02,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess it'd be troublesome to
live with someone like that.</font>

699
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:08,027
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he's not able to inherit that
money because he's mentally unstable?</font>

700
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:10,690
<font color=#FFFF00>You know, things like being
declared incompetent.</font>

701
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil, since your son
is a lawyer, ask him.</font>

702
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,639
<font color=#FFFF00>In this case, would it be the father or the
granddaughter who gets the inheritance?</font>

703
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:20,967
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. I think I
heard something about this.</font>

704
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:24,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness! Chung-ja might hit jackpot!</font>

705
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:28,983
<font color=#FFFF00>But Chung-ja seemed like she
was dying at the hospital.</font>

706
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:31,553
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with her? Is she
worried about something?</font>

707
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:36,681
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. The elder she served her
entire life might lose his life.</font>

708
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:38,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course she's serious.</font>

709
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:41,433
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, right! It makes more sense that she's</font>

710
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,054
<font color=#FFFF00>anxious he won't pass
away this time either!</font>

711
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,617
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, come on! How can you say that?</font>

712
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:50,616
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, did your son mention
anything about Dr. Yoon?</font>

713
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:53,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr. Yoon? Who's that?</font>

714
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:57,847
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil kept pestering me, so I
arranged a meeting for her son.</font>

715
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,268
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the daughter of the
director of a famous</font>

716
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:02,239
<font color=#FFFF00>hospital in Gangnam. She's a dermatologist.</font>

717
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,069
<font color=#FFFF00>So what happened?</font>

718
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:09,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing happened. They just met once.</font>

719
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:14,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope things will work out
between them this time.</font>

720
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:18,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. I heard they're going to meet
up again. I don't know what will happen.</font>

721
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:20,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

722
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:26,515
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

723
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,577
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be hungry.</font>

724
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:31,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat this.</font>

725
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:33,967
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

726
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,569
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't eat, I'll get in trouble.</font>

727
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:40,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll leave this here, so please eat.</font>

728
00:50:51,944 --> 00:50:53,217
<font color=#FFFF00>This won't do.</font>

729
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,600
<font color=#FFFF00>If father wakes up, and he
doesn't see me, he'll worry.</font>

730
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:31,596
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, is this really the
way to Saetbyul Hospital?</font>

731
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,263
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you that it was. How
many times are you asking me?</font>

732
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:38,554
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

733
00:51:43,296 --> 00:51:45,264
<font color=#FFFF00>My card! Card wallet!</font>

734
00:51:47,765 --> 00:51:49,365
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae took it from me.</font>

735
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:55,858
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, I don't have my card.</font>

736
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:00,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I pay you when my father wakes up?</font>

737
00:52:05,093 --> 00:52:07,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you joking? Get out right now!</font>

738
00:52:08,038 --> 00:52:09,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay...</font>

739
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:13,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, my father is very wealthy.</font>

740
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:14,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out.
- Okay.</font>

741
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,296
<font color=#FFFF00>Where am I?</font>

742
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,681
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have my cell-phone or my card.</font>

743
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:35,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Where the heck am I?</font>

744
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:38,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am! Ma'am!</font>

745
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:42,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am, where did my dad go?</font>

746
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,390
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not in there?</font>

747
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:45,163
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not! That's why I'm asking you!</font>

748
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to watch him carefully!</font>

749
00:52:51,811 --> 00:52:52,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going?</font>

750
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,866
<font color=#FFFF00>My dad is missing.</font>

751
00:52:55,124 --> 00:52:56,124
<font color=#FFFF00>Again?</font>

752
00:52:56,398 --> 00:52:57,952
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he went to the hospital?</font>

753
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:03,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

754
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:06,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. That's my grandfather.</font>

755
00:53:08,187 --> 00:53:09,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Where?</font>

756
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Shin-ae.</font>

757
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,518
<font color=#FFFF00>We're going to the hospital, aren't we?
You're taking me to my father, aren't you?</font>

758
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:25,546
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, he's so darn disobedient!</font>

759
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:29,596
<font color=#FFFF00>Open the door! Open the door!</font>

760
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:32,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Good job. Here.</font>

761
00:53:32,937 --> 00:53:35,569
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae! Ms. Ma!</font>

762
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Please open this door for me.</font>

763
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:44,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't open the door for him, except
for when you're going to feed him.</font>

764
00:53:44,484 --> 00:53:47,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I'm going
to stick by his side.</font>

765
00:53:48,288 --> 00:53:50,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae! Ms. Ma!</font>

766
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,483
<font color=#FFFF00>Please open the door! Please!</font>

767
00:53:58,304 --> 00:54:00,913
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae! Ms. Ma!</font>

768
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:05,694
<font color=#FFFF00>Please open this door! Shin-ae!</font>

769
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:13,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, I'm sorry. Okay? I won't do
it ever again, so open this door!</font>

770
00:54:13,408 --> 00:54:15,069
<font color=#FFFF00>Open this door!</font>

771
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:24,708
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go to my father!
Open this door, Shin-ae!</font>

772
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:26,934
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Ma!</font>

773
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:32,536
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. Yoo-sung. Watch carefully.</font>

774
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:35,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, I'm going to start.</font>

775
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:39,974
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard there's a deep story
behind these Father's Dumplings.</font>

776
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,973
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yes.</font>

777
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:48,661
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, my mom and I
are North Korean defectors.</font>

778
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:54,791
<font color=#FFFF00>When we escaped, my father suffered a
gunshot wound, so we thought he had died.</font>

779
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Not too long ago, we saw
that he was alive in Seoul.</font>

780
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,512
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow. That's shocking news.</font>

781
00:55:03,145 --> 00:55:05,458
<font color=#FFFF00>Please tell us about your father.</font>

782
00:55:05,646 --> 00:55:06,646
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

783
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:11,067
<font color=#FFFF00>My father's name is Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

784
00:55:12,388 --> 00:55:14,709
<font color=#FFFF00>He has big and bright eyes. He's of medium</font>

785
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:17,270
<font color=#FFFF00>height, and he speaks in
a North Korean accent.</font>

786
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:21,695
<font color=#FFFF00>If you've seen someone like
that, please contact us.</font>

787
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:27,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help us find my father.</font>

788
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:33,122
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Your father might be watching this
program, so please say something to him.</font>

789
00:55:35,763 --> 00:55:36,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

790
00:55:37,957 --> 00:55:38,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Seung-hee.</font>

791
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:46,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, Yoo-sung, and I are all
desperately waiting for you.</font>

792
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:51,051
<font color=#FFFF00>Until we meet again,</font>

793
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:55,020
<font color=#FFFF00>please be healthy.</font>

794
00:55:56,685 --> 00:56:00,007
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, let's meet again.</font>

795
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:06,309
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you're really good, aunt!
You're amazing!</font>

796
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:12,239
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, if your aunt speaks like that, do
you think your grandfather will call us?</font>

797
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,708
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, he'll definitely call us.</font>

798
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,551
<font color=#FFFF00>Good job. Do exactly this tomorrow.</font>

799
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:23,887
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, I'm so nervous. It's a live
broadcast tomorrow. What if I mess up?</font>

800
00:56:23,912 --> 00:56:25,395
<font color=#FFFF00>Not again.</font>

801
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:27,569
<font color=#FFFF00>You did well. Just keep going.</font>

802
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,731
<font color=#FFFF00>- Right, mother?
- Yes. You did well.</font>

803
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,810
<font color=#FFFF00>One more time?</font>

804
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,310
<font color=#FFFF00>One more time.</font>

805
00:56:35,738 --> 00:56:37,997
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ms. Ma!
- Oh my goodness.</font>

806
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:42,333
<font color=#FFFF00>Go and do something about him!
How can he not get tired?</font>

807
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,903
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did he eat that he has so much energy?
- I'm going to go to my father!</font>

808
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:49,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, Mi-poong's
program is going to be on</font>

809
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,786
<font color=#FFFF00>air soon. What are you
going to do about that?</font>

810
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:55,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. There's obstacle after obstacle.</font>

811
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:57,508
<font color=#FFFF00>He still didn't find a way to stop it?</font>

812
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:01,963
<font color=#FFFF00>This can never happen! If
that program is aired,</font>

813
00:57:02,222 --> 00:57:05,067
<font color=#FFFF00>my husband, Hee-dong, or
anyone else could see it!</font>

814
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:08,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Then Mi-poong becomes the
real granddaughter, and</font>

815
00:57:08,919 --> 00:57:12,081
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll be revealed to the
world as an imposter!</font>

816
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:16,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother! Watch what you're saying!
What if someone</font>

817
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,228
<font color=#FFFF00>hears us outside? What will you do then?</font>

818
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine! I'll be careful!</font>

819
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:37,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mr. Heo. Did you find a way?</font>

820
00:57:39,802 --> 00:57:42,402
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you still be looking for a way?</font>

821
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Find it right now! Right now!</font>

822
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:50,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Open this door...</font>

823
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:53,556
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go to my father...</font>

824
00:57:55,896 --> 00:57:57,934
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go to my father.</font>

825
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:00,387
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae.</font>

826
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:05,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Open this door.</font>

827
00:58:08,114 --> 00:58:09,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

828
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:12,739
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

829
00:58:17,614 --> 00:58:18,895
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father...
- Ma'am?</font>

830
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,322
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this sound?</font>

831
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:25,669
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is...</font>

832
00:58:27,013 --> 00:58:28,208
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae...</font>

833
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:29,771
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that?</font>

834
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:33,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Dae-hoon locked in there right now?</font>

835
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:37,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Who the heck did such a thing?</font>

836
00:58:37,669 --> 00:58:38,736
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's the key?</font>

837
00:58:38,761 --> 00:58:42,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Your wife and your daughter-in-law...</font>

838
00:58:42,536 --> 00:58:43,536
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

839
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:45,794
<font color=#FFFF00>Park Shin-ae!</font>

840
00:58:46,177 --> 00:58:47,177
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma Chung-ja!</font>

841
00:58:50,544 --> 00:58:51,817
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that your father-in-law?</font>

842
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:54,380
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey!
- Oh my gosh!</font>

843
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:57,411
<font color=#FFFF00>What the hell did you do?</font>

844
00:58:57,825 --> 00:59:00,864
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</font>

845
00:59:02,763 --> 00:59:03,763
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

846
00:59:04,232 --> 00:59:06,434
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where's the key.
- Here...</font>

847
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:21,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. Honey!</font>

848
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:28,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho!</font>

849
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:32,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Dae-hoon. You're okay now.
You're safe.</font>

850
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:34,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho!</font>

851
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:40,438
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do such a thing?</font>

852
00:59:40,771 --> 00:59:44,790
<font color=#FFFF00>He snuck out and got lost again!</font>

853
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:46,169
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why we did this!</font>

854
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:49,606
<font color=#FFFF00>- It hasn't even been an hour
since we locked him up in there.
- Hey, Ma Chung-ja!</font>

855
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:51,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to die?</font>

856
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:52,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he a criminal or a beast?</font>

857
00:59:53,646 --> 00:59:55,067
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do such a thing?</font>

858
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:59,661
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, you shouldn't do this. How
could you do this to your dad?</font>

859
01:00:00,177 --> 01:00:04,732
<font color=#FFFF00>I had an important meeting,
but my dad got lost again...</font>

860
01:00:04,757 --> 01:00:06,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think that makes any sense?</font>

861
01:00:06,872 --> 01:00:10,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Was that meeting so important? Was
it more important than your dad?</font>

862
01:00:11,911 --> 01:00:13,396
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a really nasty piece of work!</font>

863
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:16,716
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, you're being too harsh.</font>

864
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,477
<font color=#FFFF00>What? I'm being too harsh?</font>

865
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:23,458
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you act this way if he really
was your biological brother?</font>

866
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:26,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it okay with you if my dad gets lost?</font>

867
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:29,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you take responsibility
if he gets lost?</font>

868
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:31,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'll take responsibility!</font>

869
01:00:32,614 --> 01:00:33,881
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, let's go.</font>

870
01:00:54,716 --> 01:00:55,716
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

871
01:00:56,427 --> 01:00:57,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

872
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,864
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, I'm here.</font>

873
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:06,637
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, I missed you.</font>

874
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,895
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

875
01:01:28,716 --> 01:01:29,801
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

876
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:45,973
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going somewhere looking like that?
Do you have an audition?</font>

877
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:47,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, it's not an audition.</font>

878
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:49,247
<font color=#FFFF00>Something similar to that.</font>

879
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,186
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, right.</font>

880
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:55,484
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, Jang-soo is going
to become a dumpling-eating</font>

881
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:58,906
<font color=#FFFF00>model for his ex-sister-in-law
at home shopping!</font>

882
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:00,700
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Is that true?</font>

883
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:02,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you crazy?</font>

884
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo, are you ready? Let's go.</font>

885
01:02:06,107 --> 01:02:10,307
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to Mi-poong's
home shopping broadcast, too?</font>

886
01:02:10,841 --> 01:02:16,778
<font color=#FFFF00>They asked us to be models who eat
dumplings, so we're going over there. Happy?</font>

887
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:18,466
<font color=#FFFF00>Ridiculous.</font>

888
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:19,661
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother!</font>

889
01:02:19,686 --> 01:02:20,686
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

890
01:02:21,193 --> 01:02:25,669
<font color=#FFFF00>We're family, so we should
help out when we can.</font>

891
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:28,566
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't ask you to come
with us, so stop nagging.</font>

892
01:02:28,818 --> 01:02:34,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you watch Rainbow
Home Shopping at 5:00 tonight.</font>

893
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:35,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Check if I look pretty or not.</font>

894
01:02:36,308 --> 01:02:41,593
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, let's go.
- Okay. Mom, Mi-poong's program starts at 5:00!</font>

895
01:02:42,435 --> 01:02:45,582
<font color=#FFFF00>I really don't want Jang-soo to
come out in something like that!</font>

896
01:02:45,739 --> 01:02:49,411
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm going crazy! Oh my god!
- Does he really want to do that?</font>

897
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:53,842
<font color=#FFFF00>How much is it for these abundant amounts?</font>

898
01:02:54,716 --> 01:02:55,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, well...</font>

899
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,085
<font color=#FFFF00>There are three packs of Father's
Dumplings and three packs</font>

900
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:04,232
<font color=#FFFF00>of kimchi dumplings. A total of
six packs are all for $29.90.</font>

901
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:09,468
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to make dumplings at home,
you need to make the skin and insides.</font>

902
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:11,092
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a lot of work.</font>

903
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,271
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to worry about such thing.</font>

904
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:17,571
<font color=#FFFF00>If you buy these Father's
Dumplings and put them</font>

905
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:19,748
<font color=#FFFF00>in the fridge, you won't have any problems.</font>

906
01:03:20,037 --> 01:03:23,736
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll arrange the sets how you
like, so don't worry about it.</font>

907
01:03:24,037 --> 01:03:26,146
<font color=#FFFF00>Please order right now.</font>

908
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Cut! Okay!</font>

909
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:29,636
<font color=#FFFF00>He said it's okay!</font>

910
01:03:35,826 --> 01:03:37,318
<font color=#FFFF00>You did so well, Mi-poong!</font>

911
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:41,825
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? I wasn't awkward?
- No! You weren't awkward at all!
You did very well!</font>

912
01:03:42,108 --> 01:03:45,626
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mother, you look beautiful on screen.
- Really?</font>

913
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:47,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, you seem like a real model.</font>

914
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,358
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I really look okay?</font>

915
01:03:50,545 --> 01:03:52,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- Of course!
- I need to eat prettily.</font>

916
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:53,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, what about me?</font>

917
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- Of course you look cool!
- Yes!</font>

918
01:03:56,725 --> 01:03:58,717
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what I just said!</font>

919
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:02,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I must be out of my mind. I don't
remember anything I just said!</font>

920
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:04,294
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, you did really well.
You just need to</font>

921
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,147
<font color=#FFFF00>do the same thing during
the live broadcast.</font>

922
01:04:06,172 --> 01:04:08,521
<font color=#FFFF00>Should we do a cheer before the live show?</font>

923
01:04:08,546 --> 01:04:10,881
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yeah, let's do that!
- Yes.</font>

924
01:04:10,906 --> 01:04:12,991
<font color=#FFFF00>Go Father's Dumplings on one, two, three.</font>

925
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,904
<font color=#FFFF00>Go Father's Dumplings!</font>

926
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:17,726
<font color=#FFFF00>We're going to start!</font>

927
01:04:17,866 --> 01:04:22,413
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried these. They're so big that you'll
feel full from just eating one of them.</font>

928
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:26,147
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's right.
- Not only is the taste guaranteed.
The price is, too.</font>

929
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:29,163
<font color=#FFFF00>The price is great. It really was
hard to meet the supply demand today.</font>

930
01:04:29,188 --> 01:04:33,426
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the chance to be able to get
five kilograms of these for just $29.90.</font>

931
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:35,682
<font color=#FFFF00>- You must take this chance.
- Consumers definitely</font>

932
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:37,550
<font color=#FFFF00>know a good product when they see one.</font>

933
01:04:37,575 --> 01:04:40,312
<font color=#FFFF00>The calls are coming in.
If you would like to order</font>

934
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:42,972
<font color=#FFFF00>- quickly, please use the home shopping app.
- Father,</font>

935
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:46,746
<font color=#FFFF00>after the Jeju oranges are sold,
they'll sell dumplings next.</font>

936
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:52,395
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to eat dumplings.</font>

937
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:58,186
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father's Dumplings)</font>

938
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,166
<font color=#FFFF00>Five minutes before we go on air!</font>

939
01:05:10,023 --> 01:05:11,501
<font color=#FFFF00>(Rainbow Home Shopping)</font>

940
01:05:11,526 --> 01:05:14,056
<font color=#FFFF00>(Five minutes later, Father's
Dumplings will be on the show)</font>

941
01:05:35,254 --> 01:05:36,822
<font color=#FFFF00>(Blow Breeze)</font>

942
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,033
<font color=#FFFF00>Here we go!</font>

943
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:41,629
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's do our best thinking that
father will be watching this show.
- Okay.</font>

944
01:05:43,174 --> 01:05:44,878
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the chairman's granddaughter.</font>

945
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:47,810
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean I'm fired?</font>

946
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:50,658
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you crazy?</font>

947
01:05:50,683 --> 01:05:54,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes! You two are driving me crazy!
What are you going to do about this?</font>

948
01:05:54,269 --> 01:05:55,939
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil, I'm sorry!</font>

949
01:05:55,964 --> 01:05:57,831
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with my father?</font>

950
01:05:57,963 --> 01:05:59,622
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father!
- Mr. Kim!</font>

951
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:02,094
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the point of saying
that to someone who's dead?</font>

952
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,627
<font color=#FFFF00>"Someone who's dead?"</font>

953
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I recorded everything.</font>

954
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:07,976
<font color=#FFFF00>He was doing a background
search on me all this time?</font>

955
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:09,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, by any chance...?</font>
