156
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:10,388
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

157
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,951
<font color="yellow">I was on my way to come see you...</font>

158
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:25,820
<font color="yellow">but there was an
injured kitten that was crying.</font>

159
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,442
<font color="yellow">Its cry was so sad that
I couldn't just pass by it.</font>

160
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,310
<font color="yellow">I treated the kitten and
took it to the shelter afterward.</font>

161
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:40,791
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

162
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

163
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,153
<font color="yellow">I was going to call you,
but my phone was gone.</font>

164
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:58,994
<font color="yellow">I think I must have dropped it
while running with the kitten.</font>

165
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:02,825
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

166
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:04,466
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

167
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,247
<font color="yellow">That's why I wasn't able
to get in touch with you.</font>

168
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:14,304
<font color="yellow">But I didn't think you would
have still waited for me.</font>

169
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:20,692
<font color="yellow">Just like you said, we had promised
to meet, so I just came by just in case.</font>

170
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,352
<font color="yellow">You have a scratch on your forehead!</font>

171
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,614
<font color="yellow">Oh, this?</font>

172
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:38,936
<font color="yellow">I was holding the kitten
and running with it,</font>

173
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:44,700
<font color="yellow">but I think it was very hurt by people.</font>

174
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,612
<font color="yellow">This is nothing compared to the hurt
the kitten received from other people.</font>

175
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:52,864
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

176
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,782
<font color="yellow">But what do I need
to do for the modeling?</font>

177
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:14,263
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

178
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:16,372
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

179
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:21,459
<font color="yellow">Look over here. Hello.</font>

180
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:23,802
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

181
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,283
<font color="yellow">Bark. Bark.</font>

182
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,714
<font color="yellow">- What do you think?
- Looks good.</font>

183
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,445
<font color="yellow">The color is very pretty.</font>

184
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,997
<font color="yellow">- I'll pick one for you.
- Sure.</font>

185
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,066
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's pretty!</font>

186
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,272
<font color="yellow">It looks like you'll be
very good at magic.</font>

187
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:56,325
<font color="yellow">- Weird, huh?
- No, you look like a very competent person.</font>

188
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,812
<font color="yellow">Is this helpful?</font>

189
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,028
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

190
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,053
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

191
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:08,283
<font color="yellow">Can you delete this one, please?</font>

192
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:11,224
<font color="yellow">It's so weird!</font>

193
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,084
<font color="yellow">Hold on. I don't think
this one will do either.</font>

194
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:19,253
<font color="yellow">You look very pretty.</font>

195
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,582
<font color="yellow">- Want to take another one?
- The selfies came out great.</font>

196
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:33,713
<font color="yellow">This is lemon tea.</font>

197
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:44,822
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

198
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:46,801
<font color="yellow">I made it a while ago.</font>

199
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:48,138
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

200
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:49,372
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

201
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,500
<font color="yellow">It's very good.</font>

202
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,405
<font color="yellow">It smells great, too.</font>

203
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

204
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:03,816
<font color="yellow">I know. Don't worry.</font>

205
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:10,484
<font color="yellow">I won't be upset over
such a worthless girl anymore.</font>

206
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:17,094
<font color="yellow">But after seeing her again today,
I realized she really is worthless.</font>

207
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:19,022
<font color="yellow">Do you know what she told me?</font>

208
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:23,695
<font color="yellow">She asked where is the
evidence that she stole our money.</font>

209
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:26,801
<font color="yellow">She demanded if there were
witnesses that saw her stealing it.</font>

210
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,226
<font color="yellow">She really said that?</font>

211
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:35,739
<font color="yellow">Yes, and then she accused our money
of being stolen from the people.</font>

212
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,934
<font color="yellow">She was very confident,
even though she stole our money.</font>

213
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:41,942
<font color="yellow">She's a crazy wench.</font>

214
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,670
<font color="yellow">That's what she said?</font>

215
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:45,153
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

216
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:50,487
<font color="yellow">We suffered so much
in China because of her.</font>

217
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,453
<font color="yellow">If I think about that, I can't...</font>

218
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:59,770
<font color="yellow">Later on, when I meet her,
I need to pluck out all of her hair.</font>

219
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,183
<font color="yellow">That's the only way I'll be able to wash
away all the resentment in my heart.</font>

220
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,872
<font color="yellow">Yes, mom.</font>

221
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:10,853
<font color="yellow">When we meet her again,
let's pluck out all of her hair.</font>

222
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,100
<font color="yellow">I'll pluck all of them out.</font>

223
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,043
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

224
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:24,004
<font color="yellow">I'm alive right now
because I'm with you.</font>

225
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:28,322
<font color="yellow">What would I have done
if you weren't here?</font>

226
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:30,895
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

227
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,708
<font color="yellow">Hi, Young-soon.</font>

228
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,077
<font color="yellow">I was just about to leave now.</font>

229
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,584
<font color="yellow">You're going to be late? How late?</font>

230
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,206
<font color="yellow">Oh, all right.</font>

231
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:04,864
<font color="yellow">We'll start first.</font>

232
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:06,611
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later.</font>

233
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,757
<font color="yellow">Wait, Young-soon!</font>

234
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:15,137
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja really isn't coming, right?</font>

235
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:18,251
<font color="yellow">Okay! See you later.</font>

236
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:26,747
<font color="yellow">What? Her family is opposing you?</font>

237
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:30,780
<font color="yellow">She got her phone taken away,
and she's trapped at home.</font>

238
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:35,088
<font color="yellow">They allowed her to be careless
like that, but now they're opposing you?</font>

239
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,340
<font color="yellow">What idiots! My goodness!</font>

240
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:40,518
<font color="yellow">Grandma, how can you say that?</font>

241
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:44,003
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra and I are in love!</font>

242
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,918
<font color="yellow">So why are you treating us
like we did something wrong?</font>

243
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:49,560
<font color="yellow">Kids these days are so stubborn.</font>

244
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:54,739
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I know. They're stubborn
as if they passed the bar exam!</font>

245
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:57,390
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter how much
the world has changed.</font>

246
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,910
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense
that she got drunk and</font>

247
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:02,352
<font color="yellow">followed a man she just
met at a bar to a motel?</font>

248
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,263
<font color="yellow">How do you always meet such lousy women?</font>

249
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:06,288
<font color="yellow">Lousy?</font>

250
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:11,051
<font color="yellow">I can hold my breath for anything else
but not when you talk crap about Hee-ra!</font>

251
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:13,843
<font color="yellow">If you're going to talk crap
about someone, talk crap about me!</font>

252
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,296
<font color="yellow">Hey, Lee Jang-soo! You better tell them
that our family opposes her even more!</font>

253
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,114
<font color="yellow">That you two can
never be together! Got it?</font>

254
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:23,444
<font color="yellow">That's right! I'll never
let you two be together!</font>

255
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:25,263
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

256
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,070
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. Mom...
- Yes?</font>

257
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:36,772
<font color="yellow">Didn't Jang-soo say
his girlfriend's name is Hee-ra?</font>

258
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:39,303
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. Did he?</font>

259
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,588
<font color="yellow">The name of Geum-sil's
friend's daughter who</font>

260
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:44,830
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo went on a blind date
with was Hee-ra also.</font>

261
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,118
<font color="yellow">I'm going out.</font>

262
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:49,961
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

263
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,897
<font color="yellow">To meet my friends.</font>

264
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:54,090
<font color="yellow">Did you make up with
your 100 million dollar friend?</font>

265
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:56,283
<font color="yellow">Am I crazy? Why would
I make up with her?</font>

266
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,723
<font color="yellow">I'll be back, mother.</font>

267
00:23:57,748 --> 00:23:58,748
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

268
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:04,544
<font color="yellow">They must be leaving
her friend out in the cold.</font>

269
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,018
<font color="yellow">I guess so. Who would want
to be friends with someone who</font>

270
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,239
<font color="yellow">shows off with their
distant relative's inheritance?</font>

271
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:17,369
<font color="yellow">You better not go out
just because I did. Watch</font>

272
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:19,504
<font color="yellow">what happens when you
meet up with that boy.</font>

273
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:23,822
<font color="yellow">I'll tell your grandfather, dad,
and Hee-dong and</font>

274
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:27,118
<font color="yellow">send you away to the
heart of the mountains!</font>

275
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:31,551
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend I don't have a daughter,
shave your head,</font>

276
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:34,239
<font color="yellow">and make you rot in
the mountains forever!</font>

277
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,521
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

278
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,029
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

279
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:40,575
<font color="yellow">Am I a child? Am I in middle school?</font>

280
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:44,430
<font color="yellow">I just fell in love,
but you're going to shave</font>

281
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:47,361
<font color="yellow">my head and make me rot
in the mountains forever?</font>

282
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,397
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to me?</font>

283
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,351
<font color="yellow">It's because you're my child.</font>

284
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:55,911
<font color="yellow">If you were someone else's child,
would I do this? Am I crazy?</font>

285
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:58,786
<font color="yellow">I definitely warned you.</font>

286
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,700
<font color="yellow">Okay, mom.</font>

287
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:03,646
<font color="yellow">I won't go out.</font>

288
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:07,315
<font color="yellow">I won't go out. I'll stay home, so...</font>

289
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,129
<font color="yellow">give me my cell-phone. Please?</font>

290
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:13,292
<font color="yellow">Then you'll contact
Jang-soo or whatever his</font>

291
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:15,549
<font color="yellow">name is. It'll be like
leaving a fish to a cat.</font>

292
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:17,271
<font color="yellow">Am I crazy?</font>

293
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,162
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about him that way!</font>

294
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:23,350
<font color="yellow">He's a precious child
to his family, too!</font>

295
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:26,098
<font color="yellow">Yeah, right!</font>

296
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,372
<font color="yellow">Give me my cell-phone, you hag!</font>

297
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:38,114
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go nuts!</font>

298
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,067
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

299
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:44,372
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

300
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:50,031
<font color="yellow">Mink is great!
Mink is perfect for winter!</font>

301
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:54,195
<font color="yellow">Mom, you have to watch Hee-ra!
How can you fall sleep?</font>

302
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:57,767
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
When I was sleeping?</font>

303
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,254
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sleeping!
I was looking at this!</font>

304
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,927
<font color="yellow">You don't know when she'll run away!</font>

305
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,857
<font color="yellow">You know what to do
until I come back, don't you?</font>

306
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:13,431
<font color="yellow">Watch for her like you're watching
money in your pocket!</font>

307
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:14,935
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

308
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:17,349
<font color="yellow">I got it, so stop with the lecturing.</font>

309
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:22,770
<font color="yellow">What kind of strange boy is
Hee-ra dating for you to act this way?</font>

310
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:23,795
<font color="yellow">Is he that bad?</font>

311
00:26:24,052 --> 00:26:26,878
<font color="yellow">I don't know. We'll talk later.</font>

312
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:28,403
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

313
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:35,533
<font color="yellow">Goodness. She's just like her mom.</font>

314
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:41,513
<font color="yellow">What on earth is her boyfriend like?</font>

315
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:47,797
<font color="yellow">Mom, where are you going?</font>

316
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:50,263
<font color="yellow">To work, of course.</font>

317
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:52,384
<font color="yellow">How can you go to work with that hand?</font>

318
00:26:52,935 --> 00:26:55,595
<font color="yellow">Tell them you can't come.
How can you work with that hand?</font>

319
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:58,414
<font color="yellow">I just started working there.
I can't do that.</font>

320
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:03,339
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful, so don't worry.</font>

321
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,497
<font color="yellow">Mom, still...</font>

322
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:07,622
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

323
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:11,955
<font color="yellow">if I stay home, I'll be sick with anger.</font>

324
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,441
<font color="yellow">If I go to work, I can forget everything,
so I'll be more comfortable. I'll be fine.</font>

325
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:19,630
<font color="yellow">Then be careful. Don't work too hard.</font>

326
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,122
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

327
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,556
<font color="yellow">By the way, let's meet
after you're done with work.</font>

328
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:28,520
<font color="yellow">It's your first day at work tomorrow,
and I need to buy you some new clothes.</font>

329
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,948
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

330
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:34,249
<font color="yellow">I already washed the clothes
I'll wear tomorrow.</font>

331
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:38,582
<font color="yellow">I want to buy you some clothes.</font>

332
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:42,438
<font color="yellow">I'll come with Yoo-sung after I'm done
with work, so you better meet us.</font>

333
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,786
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

334
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,271
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

335
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:47,044
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

336
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:49,336
<font color="yellow">Let's buy pretty clothes.</font>

337
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:58,974
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, is your son's office
settling down now?</font>

338
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:02,817
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's just starting to.</font>

339
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,669
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Already?</font>

340
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:08,043
<font color="yellow">You're so lucky.</font>

341
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:11,197
<font color="yellow">It's hard for a law office
to settle down, but</font>

342
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,831
<font color="yellow">once it does,
you'll be sweeping in money.</font>

343
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,458
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that well off yet.</font>

344
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:20,292
<font color="yellow">And Jang-go isn't being
a lawyer just for the money.</font>

345
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:24,660
<font color="yellow">But what happened between
Chung-ja's daughter and your son?</font>

346
00:28:26,192 --> 00:28:29,423
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about that.
There's nothing to talk about anyways.</font>

347
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,502
<font color="yellow">Hey! I'm here-</font>

348
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:38,634
<font color="yellow">Young-soon, what happened?</font>

349
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,702
<font color="yellow">You said Geum-sil wasn't coming today!</font>

350
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,544
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, enough already.</font>

351
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,949
<font color="yellow">Goodness. We decided to
meet today to let you two</font>

352
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:49,371
<font color="yellow">make up, so just bear with it for our sakes.</font>

353
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:52,760
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, come here.</font>

354
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,243
<font color="yellow">It was good for a while. I feel like someone
threw a bucket of cold water at me.</font>

355
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:05,330
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. You must
have been tempting someone else.</font>

356
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,854
<font color="yellow">You were tempting me in order to somehow
make your son and my daughter get together.</font>

357
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:14,834
<font color="yellow">Who were you using
that fake tactic on now?</font>

358
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:19,427
<font color="yellow">What? Fake tactic?</font>

359
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:21,686
<font color="yellow">That's right. Fake tactic.</font>

360
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:26,041
<font color="yellow">Do you know what Geum-sil did?</font>

361
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:32,012
<font color="yellow">She met my innocent daughter without me
knowing and told her to seduce her son.</font>

362
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:33,435
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

363
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,004
<font color="yellow">Are you done talking?</font>

364
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:36,270
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not.</font>

365
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:38,654
<font color="yellow">You're a crazy witch
who's trying to sell your son!</font>

366
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:40,589
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, hold back.</font>

367
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:44,611
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja!
- You need to know how scary Geum-sil is!</font>

368
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,083
<font color="yellow">She kept telling me to
borrow money from her!</font>

369
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:52,638
<font color="yellow">I thought she really was
trying to be a good friend!</font>

370
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,646
<font color="yellow">But I found out she was
just trying to steal my daughter!</font>

371
00:29:57,747 --> 00:30:00,562
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

372
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,195
<font color="yellow">Save a stranger from
the sea and he'll turn</font>

373
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,608
<font color="yellow">into your enemy.
You're worse than such a man.</font>

374
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:06,981
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

375
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:10,422
<font color="yellow">Hey! I wasn't going to say this,</font>

376
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:15,512
<font color="yellow">but did I let you borrow money
for no good reason?</font>

377
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:18,768
<font color="yellow">You were begging for your life in
front of those loan sharks, so I let</font>

378
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:21,878
<font color="yellow">you borrow money because I was
afraid something would happen to you!</font>

379
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:25,657
<font color="yellow">But what? I was using a fake tactic
on you? My goodness!</font>

380
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:30,512
<font color="yellow">You were smiling at me while saying
you would pay me back later. My goodness.</font>

381
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:33,453
<font color="yellow">Oh, Chung-ja!
You're taking private loans?</font>

382
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:35,036
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

383
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,333
<font color="yellow">That's not it...</font>

384
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:41,749
<font color="yellow">Who cares if you'll get an inheritance later
when you don't have any money now?</font>

385
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,701
<font color="yellow">She's all style and no substance.</font>

386
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,681
<font color="yellow">Did you or did you not
call yourself that?</font>

387
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:54,593
<font color="yellow">So you should earn money yourself instead
of bragging with other people's money.</font>

388
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,424
<font color="yellow">- Cousin? He's your long distance relative...
- Hey!</font>

389
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:58,636
<font color="yellow">You little!</font>

390
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:02,590
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Stop it!</font>

391
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:08,262
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

392
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:15,459
<font color="yellow">Don't hold me back!</font>

393
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,333
<font color="yellow">- About the broker you chose in China this time...
- Yes?</font>

394
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:41,961
<font color="yellow">He's really trustworthy, right?</font>

395
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,692
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

396
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:48,304
<font color="yellow">I must trust him. Yes, I do.</font>

397
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:55,794
<font color="yellow">If he even knows the slightest bit of
how desperate I am to find my family...</font>

398
00:31:56,757 --> 00:31:58,224
<font color="yellow">he should do his best.</font>

399
00:31:58,475 --> 00:31:59,475
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

400
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:03,955
<font color="yellow">He does business back and forth in China
and North Korea, so he knows the situation</font>

401
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,356
<font color="yellow">very well and has a lot of experience.
He should have some good news for you.</font>

402
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:09,449
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Yang.
- Yes?</font>

403
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,967
<font color="yellow">I want to go to China
and meet the broker myself.</font>

404
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:20,530
<font color="yellow">I want to greet him,
hold his hands, and beg him.</font>

405
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:25,409
<font color="yellow">He needs to lie low until
he finds Kim Soon-ok, so</font>

406
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,877
<font color="yellow">I think that's going
to be difficult to do, sir.</font>

407
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:31,671
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

408
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:37,224
<font color="yellow">Is the situation
that terrible right now?</font>

409
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:41,497
<font color="yellow">You know how unsettled things
are in North Korea right now.</font>

410
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,802
<font color="yellow">That's why the border security
has been reinforced,</font>

411
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:49,004
<font color="yellow">and it has become
a lot harder to find people.</font>

412
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:51,022
<font color="yellow">- Is that so?
- Yes.</font>

413
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:53,877
<font color="yellow">If there's any rumor that someone
is searching for someone, then</font>

414
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,483
<font color="yellow">that information goes to the
North Korean government right away.</font>

415
00:32:56,508 --> 00:33:00,033
<font color="yellow">They could be on put on surveillance,
and if that happens, then the</font>

416
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:03,425
<font color="yellow">person you are looking for could be
in danger before we find her first.</font>

417
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,454
<font color="yellow">That can't happen!</font>

418
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,135
<font color="yellow">That can never happen!</font>

419
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:12,603
<font color="yellow">That's why you need to put your faith
in that Chinese broker for now.</font>

420
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:14,725
<font color="yellow">He needs to do this secretly.</font>

421
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,577
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

422
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:21,450
<font color="yellow">We'll be careful here, too.</font>

423
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,475
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

424
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:24,498
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang, please do your best.</font>

425
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:28,613
<font color="yellow">I really hope we'll be
able to find her, too.</font>

426
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,132
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang,</font>

427
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:32,938
<font color="yellow">please help me out.</font>

428
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,922
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

429
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:41,154
<font color="yellow">- (Deokcheonok)
- Welcome.</font>

430
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:44,148
<font color="yellow">Welcome!</font>

431
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:02,772
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

432
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:05,842
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

433
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:10,598
<font color="yellow">Did you hurt your hand?
Did you hurt it here?</font>

434
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,014
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

435
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,186
<font color="yellow">I didn't hurt it here.</font>

436
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:18,787
<font color="yellow">I hurt it while I was
going home yesterday.</font>

437
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,256
<font color="yellow">Then you should have told us
your situation and stayed home today.</font>

438
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:29,420
<font color="yellow">I just started working here.
I couldn't do that.</font>

439
00:34:29,445 --> 00:34:31,189
<font color="yellow">Still, you should go home right now.</font>

440
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:32,975
<font color="yellow">Your hand has to get better.</font>

441
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:38,108
<font color="yellow">No, Mr. Jo, I'm fine. I'm really okay.</font>

442
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:40,954
<font color="yellow">You even made my schedule
flexible enough for Yoo-sung's</font>

443
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,955
<font color="yellow">kindergarten hours.
So how can I be so shameless?</font>

444
00:34:43,272 --> 00:34:46,272
<font color="yellow">See? I'm perfectly fine.</font>

445
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,886
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're very stubborn.</font>

446
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:52,610
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.
Since the end of your shift is</font>

447
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,491
<font color="yellow">approaching soon,
just escort the customers.</font>

448
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,977
<font color="yellow">That's okay, right?</font>

449
00:34:57,001 --> 00:35:01,178
<font color="yellow">Of course! I tried to
stop her from working, too.</font>

450
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:07,757
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

451
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:19,787
<font color="yellow">Put the tote bag in the front
and shoulder bag in the back.</font>

452
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:22,819
<font color="yellow">Also, bring out
more clothes in fall colors.</font>

453
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:02,819
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

454
00:36:03,866 --> 00:36:05,211
<font color="yellow">Can we look at some clothes?</font>

455
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:06,922
<font color="yellow">Of course. Comfortably look around.</font>

456
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,850
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

457
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:14,163
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

458
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:17,929
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?
Did she go to the restroom?</font>

459
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:21,436
<font color="yellow">Whose clothes are you looking for?</font>

460
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,026
<font color="yellow">For my daughter.</font>

461
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:27,504
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow is her first day of work.
Will there be something suitable for her?</font>

462
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:30,573
<font color="yellow">Of course. We have many office looks.</font>

463
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:32,257
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

464
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,366
<font color="yellow">This is the most popular
outfit of this season.</font>

465
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,372
<font color="yellow">I think it would suit you well.</font>

466
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:47,597
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

467
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,311
<font color="yellow">How did they come here?</font>

468
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:58,803
<font color="yellow">Did they come knowing I was here?</font>

469
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,616
<font color="yellow">No, no, no, no.</font>

470
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:12,287
<font color="yellow">If that was true, they wouldn't be
comfortably picking out clothes right now.</font>

471
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:15,756
<font color="yellow">But why do we keep
running into each other?</font>

472
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:21,821
<font color="yellow">Do they live around here?</font>

473
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:25,218
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

474
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,929
<font color="yellow">Oh! Hello!</font>

475
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:24,967
<font color="yellow">Try both of them.</font>

476
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,841
<font color="yellow">No, I'll just try on this one.</font>

477
00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:30,667
<font color="yellow">How can we just buy one outfit?
We need to at least buy two of them.</font>

478
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:31,686
<font color="yellow">Try them on.</font>

479
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:33,078
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom.</font>

480
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,637
<font color="yellow">You can try both of them.</font>

481
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:39,514
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's not like it
costs money to try them on.</font>

482
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:40,749
<font color="yellow">Try them.</font>

483
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,312
<font color="yellow">Where can I try them on?</font>

484
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,458
<font color="yellow">The fitting room is back there.</font>

485
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:47,005
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

486
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,143
<font color="yellow">Aunt, some lady is in here.</font>

487
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,671
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

488
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,414
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, are you done
wearing your clothes?</font>

489
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:13,304
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, you shouldn't do that.
Go to grandma.</font>

490
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:18,006
<font color="yellow">That little brat.</font>

491
00:39:30,897 --> 00:39:31,921
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

492
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:33,575
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy.
- Okay.</font>

493
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

494
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:39,780
<font color="yellow">I think you still have a customer
inside that fitting room.</font>

495
00:39:39,805 --> 00:39:40,805
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

496
00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:43,529
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.
There wasn't anyone else.</font>

497
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:46,729
<font color="yellow">There is a lady in there.</font>

498
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,256
<font color="yellow">Really? I'll go check.</font>

499
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:54,787
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Thank you.</font>

500
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:56,655
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Bye.</font>

501
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:11,309
<font color="yellow">Is anyone in here?</font>

502
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,616
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

503
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:24,507
<font color="yellow">Ma'am...</font>

504
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:31,536
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

505
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:33,646
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

506
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:40,358
<font color="yellow">I thought you were in the restroom.
What's wrong?</font>

507
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:41,757
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

508
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,030
<font color="yellow">Ma'am...</font>

509
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:51,110
<font color="yellow">My grandmother collapsed.</font>

510
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,858
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

511
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:56,966
<font color="yellow">You have a grandmother?</font>

512
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:04,421
<font color="yellow">After my parents had passed away,
she had raised me until now.</font>

513
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

514
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:11,015
<font color="yellow">You should hurry up and go.
I'm here, so it's okay.</font>

515
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:18,199
<font color="yellow">Can't I move to the branch
I was talking about last time?</font>

516
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:20,906
<font color="yellow">Because of your grandmother?</font>

517
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:25,140
<font color="yellow">That branch is close to
my grandmother's house.</font>

518
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:30,033
<font color="yellow">I think I have to take care of
my grandmother from now on.</font>

519
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:35,330
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to live if
something happens to her.</font>

520
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:39,459
<font color="yellow">There's no other choice
since your grandmother is ill.</font>

521
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:43,104
<font color="yellow">I can't work without you.</font>

522
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,889
<font color="yellow">But now is not the time that
I should be holding you back.</font>

523
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:51,929
<font color="yellow">I'll call that branch,
so don't worry about it.</font>

524
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:57,296
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you so much.</font>

525
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:03,605
<font color="yellow">It'll be okay.</font>

526
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:05,905
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

527
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:18,566
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, may I go home now?</font>

528
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:20,546
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

529
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

530
00:42:22,305 --> 00:42:23,866
<font color="yellow">I need to look up more data.</font>

531
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:25,402
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good luck.</font>

532
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,031
<font color="yellow">- See you at home.
- Okay.</font>

533
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,147
<font color="yellow">Were the results for Mi-poong's logo
competition announced?</font>

534
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:49,691
<font color="yellow">Should I call her?</font>

535
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:54,643
<font color="yellow">No. It would be embarrassing
for the both of us if she had lost.</font>

536
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:57,585
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

537
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:05,241
<font color="yellow">(Announcement of Final Candidates)</font>

538
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
<font color="yellow">I'm so nervous.</font>

539
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:14,937
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

540
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,436
<font color="yellow">(First place: Kim Mi-poong)</font>

541
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:20,312
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

542
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,132
<font color="yellow">First place: Kim Mi-poong?</font>

543
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:28,257
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong won first place?</font>

544
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:31,291
<font color="yellow">That Kim Mi-poong I know?</font>

545
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,077
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

546
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,282
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I was able to
gain a lot of good experiences.</font>

547
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:43,905
<font color="yellow">Of course. I knew things
would work out for you.</font>

548
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,305
<font color="yellow">If you said you were going somewhere else,
I would have never let you.</font>

549
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:50,258
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you go because
you're going to a good company.</font>

550
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:53,658
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Please take care of yourself.</font>

551
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:59,000
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, if you happen to pass
by here, you must come and visit me.</font>

552
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:00,587
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

553
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:02,377
<font color="yellow">I hope everything works out for you!</font>

554
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:03,402
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

555
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:05,913
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.</font>

556
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:09,038
<font color="yellow">- Do your best!
- Mi-poong, work hard!</font>

557
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,063
<font color="yellow">I will!</font>

558
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:23,514
<font color="yellow">Farewell, old work place.</font>

559
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:26,561
<font color="yellow">I will succeed and come back.</font>

560
00:44:39,694 --> 00:44:41,294
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

561
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:45,234
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by when I realized it
was time for you to go home, so I came</font>

562
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:48,273
<font color="yellow">to check just in case you were here.
What a coincidence we meet like this!</font>

563
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:49,842
<font color="yellow">You're on your way home, right?</font>

564
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:51,398
<font color="yellow">Well, yes...</font>

565
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:53,687
<font color="yellow">But why?</font>

566
00:44:53,712 --> 00:44:55,233
<font color="yellow">What do you mean "why?"</font>

567
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:57,530
<font color="yellow">We should go home together.</font>

568
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:01,582
<font color="yellow">What? Aren't you going to go?</font>

569
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:05,506
<font color="yellow">You must have something to tell me.</font>

570
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:07,483
<font color="yellow">Something to tell you?</font>

571
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:08,788
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

572
00:45:09,577 --> 00:45:10,577
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

573
00:45:20,382 --> 00:45:22,050
<font color="yellow">What do I have to tell you?</font>

574
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:27,239
<font color="yellow">Think about it carefully. There must
be something you want to tell me.</font>

575
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:31,630
<font color="yellow">Yeah, right. There's nothing
I especially need to tell you.</font>

576
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm disappointed.</font>

577
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:38,628
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong,
I'm really disappointed in you!</font>

578
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:41,217
<font color="yellow">Disappointed about what?</font>

579
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:44,586
<font color="yellow">I bought you black bean noodles all this time.</font>

580
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:48,912
<font color="yellow">Are you acting this way because I bought you
spicy rice cakes instead of black bean noodles?</font>

581
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:52,477
<font color="yellow">That was because you said you
wanted spicy rice cakes instead!</font>

582
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:54,827
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be like this?</font>

583
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,286
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

584
00:45:56,749 --> 00:46:00,816
<font color="yellow">Stop beating around the bush
and tell me what's on your mind!</font>

585
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,085
<font color="yellow">You won the logo competition!</font>

586
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:09,677
<font color="yellow">It wasn't even for second or
third place. You won first place!</font>

587
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:11,652
<font color="yellow">How can you not tell me about that?</font>

588
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:13,913
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

589
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,499
<font color="yellow">You're not going to tell me
you didn't know you won, are you?</font>

590
00:46:17,663 --> 00:46:20,335
<font color="yellow">Oh... that?</font>

591
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:23,061
<font color="yellow">"That?"</font>

592
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:32,610
<font color="yellow">"Oh, that?"</font>

593
00:46:33,843 --> 00:46:37,461
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, I didn't know you were
like that! They say people change</font>

594
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:41,040
<font color="yellow">once they succeed,
but you shouldn't be like this to me!</font>

595
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,741
<font color="yellow">Is that something
you should be so angry about?</font>

596
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,557
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

597
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:51,311
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, half of that success
is due to me! Half of it!</font>

598
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,707
<font color="yellow">What if I hadn't brought
your drawing to that</font>

599
00:46:53,732 --> 00:46:55,867
<font color="yellow">company? Do you think
you would have been chosen?</font>

600
00:46:55,892 --> 00:46:58,208
<font color="yellow">Do you think you could
have gotten first place?</font>

601
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:04,040
<font color="yellow">And I didn't want to say this because
it would look like I was bragging,</font>

602
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,565
<font color="yellow">but where did you prepare
for that logo competition?</font>

603
00:47:07,851 --> 00:47:11,926
<font color="yellow">You did it in my office
with my computer and printer.</font>

604
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,532
<font color="yellow">Did you or did you not?</font>

605
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:15,452
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

606
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,913
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

607
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:17,938
<font color="yellow">You did, right?</font>

608
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:20,043
<font color="yellow">Were you or were you not wrong?</font>

609
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:23,771
<font color="yellow">I think I was wrong.</font>

610
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,460
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

611
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:27,924
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

612
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,021
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

613
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:35,401
<font color="yellow">Right? You were wrong, right?</font>

614
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,958
<font color="yellow">I feel a lot better now.</font>

615
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:42,778
<font color="yellow">Shall we go?</font>

616
00:47:54,874 --> 00:47:56,560
<font color="yellow">But where are we going right now?</font>

617
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:59,015
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is the way home.</font>

618
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,148
<font color="yellow">Since you did something
very wrong today, all</font>

619
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:05,288
<font color="yellow">you need to do is
stay quiet and follow me.</font>

620
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,030
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

621
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:14,861
<font color="yellow">You should still answer me, Mi-poong.</font>

622
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:16,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

623
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:18,741
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

624
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,648
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, congratulations.</font>

625
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:35,327
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

626
00:48:36,148 --> 00:48:39,335
<font color="yellow">But this seems like
a very expensive place.</font>

627
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,451
<font color="yellow">I told you to do as I told you today.</font>

628
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:42,773
<font color="yellow">Still.</font>

629
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:43,798
<font color="yellow">Again.</font>

630
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:45,827
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

631
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:49,832
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and try it.</font>

632
00:48:55,187 --> 00:48:56,695
<font color="yellow">How is it? Good?</font>

633
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:04,703
<font color="yellow">I think you're very amazing.</font>

634
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:06,515
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

635
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:10,577
<font color="yellow">It must have been a very
competitive competition because</font>

636
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:12,609
<font color="yellow">it offered, not only prize money,
but also a job.</font>

637
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:16,401
<font color="yellow">It's not like you studied
industrial design, so</font>

638
00:49:16,426 --> 00:49:18,389
<font color="yellow">how did you manage
to get first place so easily?</font>

639
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:21,693
<font color="yellow">When I was in North Korea,
I studied art.</font>

640
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:26,313
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't dreamt of being
a dancer, I would've been an artist.</font>

641
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:29,257
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

642
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:32,866
<font color="yellow">Anyways,</font>

643
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:38,626
<font color="yellow">you won first place while you were
stressing over the housing issue,</font>

644
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:42,237
<font color="yellow">working part-time, and taking care
of your mother and nephew.</font>

645
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:44,425
<font color="yellow">Good job. You're admirable.</font>

646
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:47,980
<font color="yellow">You're embarrassing me.</font>

647
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:51,354
<font color="yellow">Why are you embarrassed
when I was merely stating the facts?</font>

648
00:49:52,461 --> 00:49:56,652
<font color="yellow">Anyone can do it with words,
but no one can actually do it like you.</font>

649
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,577
<font color="yellow">Since you're so hard-working,
a good opportunity</font>

650
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:01,242
<font color="yellow">was given to you. That's what I think.</font>

651
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:04,696
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

652
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:06,364
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

653
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:19,943
<font color="yellow">To be honest, you were
a big strength to me.</font>

654
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:22,915
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

655
00:50:27,713 --> 00:50:28,713
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go.</font>

656
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,158
<font color="yellow">Oh, Sung-sil.</font>

657
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:34,564
<font color="yellow">We meet each other frequently nowadays.</font>

658
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:35,589
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

659
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:38,139
<font color="yellow">Hello. You remember me, don't you?</font>

660
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:41,627
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

661
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,111
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

662
00:50:44,136 --> 00:50:45,306
<font color="yellow">Do you have a meeting?</font>

663
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:49,109
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we're having a company dinner,
but no one is here yet.</font>

664
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:50,690
<font color="yellow">I think I came too early.</font>

665
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:55,017
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

666
00:50:56,002 --> 00:50:58,757
<font color="yellow">You said she's like your little sister.
So why are you</font>

667
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:01,537
<font color="yellow">always with her? And what's
with this sappy atmosphere?</font>

668
00:51:01,776 --> 00:51:03,043
<font color="yellow">Stop joking around.</font>

669
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,594
<font color="yellow">She won a logo competition.</font>

670
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:08,290
<font color="yellow">So we came here to eat to
celebrate her victory and new job.</font>

671
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:10,034
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

672
00:51:10,721 --> 00:51:12,853
<font color="yellow">Oh, congratulations, miss!</font>

673
00:51:13,346 --> 00:51:14,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

674
00:51:14,712 --> 00:51:19,259
<font color="yellow">Mind if I join your celebration
before my co-workers come?</font>

675
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:24,450
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I'll buy good wine to celebrate her win, okay?</font>

676
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:29,713
<font color="yellow">Is it okay?</font>

677
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,289
<font color="yellow">- Sit down.
- Okay.</font>

678
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:39,393
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

679
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:42,095
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

680
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,412
<font color="yellow">Please suggest a good bottle
of wine for us.</font>

681
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:56,307
<font color="yellow">Hi, aunt.</font>

682
00:51:58,041 --> 00:51:59,041
<font color="yellow">Is it an urgent matter?</font>

683
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:01,002
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

684
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:03,805
<font color="yellow">I need to make a call.</font>

685
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:05,135
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

686
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:16,040
<font color="yellow">So the market acquired a lawyer?</font>

687
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:21,064
<font color="yellow">Yes. And do you know
from where? Janghaenggo.</font>

688
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,010
<font color="yellow">Janghaenggo?</font>

689
00:52:28,986 --> 00:52:31,719
<font color="yellow">That means they won't do
any settlements.</font>

690
00:52:31,745 --> 00:52:32,745
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

691
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:35,126
<font color="yellow">Aren't they too much?</font>

692
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:38,892
<font color="yellow">If they have money to spend on Janghaenggo,
they should just pay the pension.</font>

693
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:41,306
<font color="yellow">They're not going to
make any exceptions.</font>

694
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,080
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

695
00:52:43,814 --> 00:52:46,086
<font color="yellow">What else? We need to fight and win.</font>

696
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,266
<font color="yellow">Here. Cheers!</font>

697
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,558
<font color="yellow">When Jang-go comes.</font>

698
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,675
<font color="yellow">Come on. We'll do it again
when Jang-go comes.</font>

699
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:56,885
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

700
00:53:13,353 --> 00:53:17,673
<font color="yellow">I'm not a bad guy. I'm Jang-go's friend.</font>

701
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:22,499
<font color="yellow">I want to read your palm for you.</font>

702
00:53:23,018 --> 00:53:25,580
<font color="yellow">I'm a pro at reading palms.</font>

703
00:53:27,197 --> 00:53:28,197
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

704
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:29,488
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

705
00:53:30,213 --> 00:53:31,213
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

706
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:35,462
<font color="yellow">Your way of speaking is a bit...</font>

707
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:38,040
<font color="yellow">You're not from around here, are you?</font>

708
00:53:39,057 --> 00:53:40,057
<font color="yellow">Are you from China?</font>

709
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:43,513
<font color="yellow">No. I came from Pyeongyang.</font>

710
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:45,963
<font color="yellow">No wonder!</font>

711
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:52,424
<font color="yellow">Now I understand
why Jang-go friend-zoned you!</font>

712
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:58,433
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is very old-fashioned!</font>

713
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:01,203
<font color="yellow">Why does it matter where you came from?</font>

714
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:07,211
<font color="yellow">But it's true when they say
handsome men are from the south and</font>

715
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:10,613
<font color="yellow">beautiful girls are from the north.
You're a natural, aren't you?</font>

716
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:14,447
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't care if you're
from the south or north.</font>

717
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:15,963
<font color="yellow">Miss...</font>

718
00:54:17,478 --> 00:54:18,767
<font color="yellow">what do you think about me?</font>

719
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:20,290
<font color="yellow">Why do you talk that way?</font>

720
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:23,558
<font color="yellow">I have a name, too. It's Kim Mi-poong.</font>

721
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:25,337
<font color="yellow">Okay! Mi-poong!</font>

722
00:54:26,635 --> 00:54:29,108
<font color="yellow">Since I asked you a question,
you should answer me.</font>

723
00:54:30,002 --> 00:54:33,237
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, go on a date with me.</font>

724
00:54:33,262 --> 00:54:34,603
<font color="yellow">We'd be good together!</font>

725
00:54:34,628 --> 00:54:36,180
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

726
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:37,605
<font color="yellow">"What are you doing?"</font>

727
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:40,077
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

728
00:54:40,102 --> 00:54:41,705
<font color="yellow">"Why are you doing this to me?"</font>

729
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,637
<font color="yellow">Wait. That's the Gyeongsang dialect.</font>

730
00:54:44,432 --> 00:54:51,898
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this, miss?
I mean, Mi-poong. Can't you date me?</font>

731
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:53,723
<font color="yellow">Not as friends or anything!</font>

732
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:55,871
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

733
00:54:57,173 --> 00:55:00,955
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I heard North Korean
women love South Korean men.</font>

734
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,806
<font color="yellow">You're really playing hard-to-get.</font>

735
00:55:03,056 --> 00:55:04,368
<font color="yellow">Have a glass of wine.</font>

736
00:55:06,228 --> 00:55:07,228
<font color="yellow">Just one glass.</font>

737
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:10,538
<font color="yellow">Hey Bang Sung-sil!</font>

738
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:16,291
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Hey!</font>

739
00:55:18,736 --> 00:55:20,500
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Hey! Hold on!</font>

740
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,947
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, are you crazy?</font>

741
00:55:25,377 --> 00:55:26,644
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

742
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:28,079
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

743
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:31,963
<font color="yellow">You said you weren't dating her.
So why are you getting so angry?</font>

744
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:34,801
<font color="yellow">What? You don't want to
date a North Korean girl, but</font>

745
00:55:34,826 --> 00:55:37,010
<font color="yellow">- you don't want to give her to anyone else?
- What?</font>

746
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:42,603
<font color="yellow">Blood.</font>

747
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:49,722
<font color="yellow">In a pig's eye. You better not act
like you know me again.</font>

748
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:51,818
<font color="yellow">Trashy scumbag.</font>

749
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:56,533
<font color="yellow">God!</font>

750
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:13,768
