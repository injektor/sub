6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:19,423
<font color="yellow">Who is alive?</font>

00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,024
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

14

<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon? Kim Seung-hee?</font>

15
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,459
<font color="yellow">Is he talking about Kim Mi-poong?</font>

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,235
<font color="yellow">No! No way!</font>

17
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,511
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Get a hold of yourself!</font>

18

- Don't touch me!</font>

21
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:10,798
<font color="yellow">Get up. Get a hold of yourself.</font>

22
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,001
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Chung-ja.</font>

23
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:18,098
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, get the airline tickets immediately!</font>

24
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,531
<font color="yellow">Let's go to China right now.</font>

25
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:22,437
<font color="yellow">I need to go find my granddaughter!</font>

26
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:25,246
<font color="yellow">- Elder!
- Mr. Kim!</font>

27
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:30,227
<font color="yellow">Elder, I'll get the airline tickets and
prepare everything, so please calm down.</font>

28
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:33,585
<font color="yellow">- I have go right now!
- Goodness!</font>

29
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:36,661
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, even if you go right now,
it'll be useless.</font>

30
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:40,830
<font color="yellow">Your granddaughter disappeared and
we don't know where she is right now.</font>

31
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,532
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

32
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,945
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you don't know where my one
and only granddaughter is right now?</font>

33
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:53,734
<font color="yellow">The only information I have about her is
that she's alive and somewhere in China.</font>

34
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:58,049
<font color="yellow">I don't care how much money it takes. Mr. Yang,</font>

35
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,781
<font color="yellow">please find her using any means you can!</font>

36
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,317
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

37
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,289
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho...</font>

38
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:09,937
<font color="yellow">what on earth happened?</font>

39
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:15,327
<font color="yellow">I thought we would be able to
meet one day if they're alive.</font>

40
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:17,688
<font color="yellow">Elder...</font>

41
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:22,835
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

42
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:27,499
<font color="yellow">I must get a hold of myself.</font>

43
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:29,304
<font color="yellow">I must!</font>

44
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:35,882
<font color="yellow">That way, I'll be able to
find my granddaughter.</font>

45
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,069
<font color="yellow">My granddaughter!</font>

46
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:39,545
<font color="yellow">Elder.</font>

47
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,686
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to find her.</font>

48
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:45,209
<font color="yellow">Elder!</font>

49
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,639
<font color="yellow">Bring me some water and Cheongsimhwan.
We have Cheongsimhwan, don't we?</font>

50
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,787
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

51
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:56,068
<font color="yellow">What do you mean his granddaughter is alive?</font>

52
00:02:56,538 --> 00:03:00,489
<font color="yellow">Were you searching for his blood relatives
behind my back all this time?</font>

53
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,954
<font color="yellow">How could you not say one word
to me about this? How could you?</font>

54
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,342
<font color="yellow">That's not important right now! Elder fainted!</font>

55
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,786
<font color="yellow">Father, here's water.</font>

56
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,076
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

57
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,792
<font color="yellow">How can his granddaughter be alive?</font>

58
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:25,774
<font color="yellow">Mom, if his granddaughter
comes back, what will happen to us?</font>

59
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:26,904
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

60
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,462
<font color="yellow">Everything will be over.</font>

61
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:33,135
<font color="yellow">She'll be the owner of this house,
and you'll just be the distant relatives.</font>

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,779
<font color="yellow">You guys will be on your own now.</font>

63
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:42,389
<font color="yellow">- Goodness.
- Chung-ja! Let's go to your room.
Get a hold of yourself!</font>

64
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:52,747
<font color="yellow">He should have told me he was
looking for his blood relatives.</font>

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,209
<font color="yellow">Then I wouldn't have lived so foolishly!</font>

66
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:03,036
<font color="yellow">I served him with devotion
like I was his biological child!</font>

67
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:07,476
<font color="yellow">How can he search for his family
in North Korea behind my back?</font>

68
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,257
<font color="yellow">How can he do this to me?</font>

69
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,962
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho is the worst one!</font>

70
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,749
<font color="yellow">Even if Mr. Kim wanted
to find his family, Dal-ho</font>

71
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,820
<font color="yellow">should have just said he couldn't find them!</font>

72
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:20,937
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

73
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,193
<font color="yellow">I really don't want to live with him anymore!</font>

74
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:28,452
<font color="yellow">I'm going to divorce him!</font>

75
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,477
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

76
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:32,309
<font color="yellow">If Mr. Kim finds his granddaughter,
Dal-ho won't have any rights</font>

77
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:35,083
<font color="yellow">over the inheritance, so what's
the use of staying with him?</font>

78
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,211
<font color="yellow">Divorce him!</font>

79
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:43,266
<font color="yellow">This is so unfair!</font>

80
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,546
<font color="yellow">According to grandmother,
if the granddaughter comes back,</font>

81
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,703
<font color="yellow">she'll become the
new owner of this house.</font>

82
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,945
<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon. Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

83
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,015
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee. Kim Seung-hee.</font>

84
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,234
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

85
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:23,113
<font color="yellow">His granddaughter is in China.</font>

86
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:28,867
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

87
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:30,469
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

88
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:31,976
<font color="yellow">It's money.</font>

89
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,273
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

90
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:42,867
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

91
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,148
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

92
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:10,047
<font color="yellow">I did everything you told me to do.</font>

93
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,359
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

94
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

95
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:17,137
<font color="yellow">I organized all the proposals within the past</font>

96
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:19,815
<font color="yellow">five years from all the
market teams by seasons.</font>

97
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,706
<font color="yellow">Wow! You're really good at working!</font>

98
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,148
<font color="yellow">You're very skillful!</font>

99
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:31,575
<font color="yellow">If I had known you would've been
so good, I would've made you</font>

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,976
<font color="yellow">organize all the proposals
from the past ten years instead.</font>

101
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:36,633
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

102
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,893
<font color="yellow">May I go home now?</font>

103
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:41,869
<font color="yellow">It's way past closing hour.</font>

104
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,305
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

105
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:50,117
<font color="yellow">I, the boss, haven't left yet, so how
can you, my secretary, leave first?</font>

106
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,703
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

107
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:00,937
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim!</font>

108
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,469
<font color="yellow">When was the last time you did
a big clean-up around here?</font>

109
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,890
<font color="yellow">A big clean-up?</font>

110
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,966
<font color="yellow">The cleaning lady vacuums every morning,
and I wipe down everything now and then.</font>

111
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:12,984
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

112
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,726
<font color="yellow">I grew up sheltered, so
my respiratory system is very weak.</font>

113
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:24,062
<font color="yellow">If there's even a tiny speck of dust...</font>

114
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:31,405
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Get a wet mop and wipe everything.</font>

115
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:37,406
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

116
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:49,452
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll let you go so easily?</font>

117
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:51,810
<font color="yellow">Not a chance!</font>

118
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:00,192
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's hold it in.</font>

119
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,523
<font color="yellow">I came this far.</font>

120
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,440
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, hold it in.</font>

121
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:06,898
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

122
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:16,297
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

123
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:18,242
<font color="yellow">Here, too.</font>

124
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,419
<font color="yellow">Good. And over here.</font>

125
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,109
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,681
<font color="yellow">I already wiped this spot.</font>

127
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,711
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

128
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,957
<font color="yellow">How dare you question your boss.</font>

129
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:30,704
<font color="yellow">If I tell you to wipe it, you wipe it.</font>

130
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,390
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

131
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,535
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you coming out yet?</font>

132
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,304
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to you?</font>

133
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,673
<font color="yellow">Is Sung-sik bothering you?</font>

134
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:51,288
<font color="yellow">I'm in front of your office right now.
Do you want me to come inside?</font>

135
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,443
<font color="yellow">That's from Jang-go, right?</font>

136
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:58,929
<font color="yellow">How dare he send a private
message during work hours.</font>

137
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,281
<font color="yellow">Jang-go has no manners at all.</font>

138
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:12,180
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, put some strength into
your hands. Scrub it nice and hard!</font>

139
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,683
<font color="yellow">That's it! Use all your strength!
You're doing great!</font>

140
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:18,437
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

141
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:23,851
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

142
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,848
<font color="yellow">Bang Sung-sik, what do you
think you're doing right now?</font>

143
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:33,857
<font color="yellow">It's already past closing time, and
yet, you're still making her clean.</font>

144
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,275
<font color="yellow">You're a funny one!</font>

145
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:38,531
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong is my secretary, not yours.</font>

146
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,301
<font color="yellow">Why would you care if I make
my secretary clean or not?</font>

147
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,354
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, give that to me.</font>

148
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,344
<font color="yellow">It's past closing time.</font>

149
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,656
<font color="yellow">If someone needs to clean up, you do it.</font>

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

151
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,277
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, just wait outside for a little bit.</font>

152
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,370
<font color="yellow">You don't have to listen to him.</font>

153
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:02,828
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

154
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,109
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

155
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,491
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim! Mi-poong!</font>

156
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,773
<font color="yellow">Prepare to quit! I'm going to fire you!</font>

157
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,078
<font color="yellow">This wasn't what I had in mind...</font>

158
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:26,406
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

159
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,211
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo...</font>

160
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,957
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

161
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:51,809
<font color="yellow">It's barley tea.</font>

162
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:54,626
<font color="yellow">It's nice because it's warm.</font>

163
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,945
<font color="yellow">It's similar to grandfather's ring.</font>

164
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,783
<font color="yellow">No. I think it's the same.</font>

165
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,202
<font color="yellow">But I don't see the character for
"Cheon" on it. Maybe I'm wrong then.</font>

166
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,426
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here? No one will welcome you.</font>

167
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,952
<font color="yellow">You didn't come out to the restaurant.</font>

168
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:19,248
<font color="yellow">I was worried about you.</font>

169
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,556
<font color="yellow">Why would you worry about me?</font>

170
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,358
<font color="yellow">You were upset because of
my mother-in-law, weren't you?</font>

171
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,470
<font color="yellow">I heard what happened.</font>

172
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:31,641
<font color="yellow">You must have come here because you were scared</font>

173
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:33,992
<font color="yellow">I would reveal your identity and harm you.</font>

174
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:36,904
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about such a thing.</font>

175
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,153
<font color="yellow">I really didn't come here because of that.</font>

176
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:47,185
<font color="yellow">I just missed you, and I kept thinking
about how I hurt you and Seung-hee.</font>

177
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,874
<font color="yellow">You came to your senses now.</font>

178
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:56,836
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

179
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,909
<font color="yellow">Is your mother-in-law giving you a hard time?</font>

180
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:03,001
<font color="yellow">She seems to have a terrible temper.</font>

181
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:08,903
<font color="yellow">You got married to him because you wanted to.</font>

182
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,320
<font color="yellow">What else can you do but endure it?</font>

183
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:15,955
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

184
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,726
<font color="yellow">I just feel like it's all my fault
that you're living like this.</font>

185
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,617
<font color="yellow">The more I think about it, the guiltier I feel.</font>

186
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,382
<font color="yellow">When I make money in the future,
I'll be sure to pay you back.</font>

187
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,836
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

188
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:41,289
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

189
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,908
<font color="yellow">Your mother-in-law must be
giving you a really hard time.</font>

190
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,489
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

191
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,460
<font color="yellow">did you get kicked out? Is that why
you're here at such a late hour?</font>

192
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

193
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,301
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

194
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,834
<font color="yellow">She must be having a really
hard time with her in-laws.</font>

195
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:26,454
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee, the granddaughter
he's looking for, is actually Kim Mi-poong?</font>

196
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:32,492
<font color="yellow">That's impossible. Impossible...</font>

197
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,214
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

198
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,870
<font color="yellow">Don't be mad. I said I was sorry.</font>

199
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,217
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to stand by and do nothing when</font>

200
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:56,523
<font color="yellow">I witnessed you being mistreated by Sung-sik?</font>

201
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,769
<font color="yellow">Still, that was my work, and it was
something I should have handled on my own.</font>

202
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:03,097
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do if I really get fired?</font>

203
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,620
<font color="yellow">Let's use this chance to find
a different company for you.</font>

204
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,050
<font color="yellow">How about it?</font>

205
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,075
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

206
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:13,508
<font color="yellow">After I came to South Korea, I struggled
until I came into this company.</font>

207
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:16,151
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even dream of
becoming a permanent worker.</font>

208
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:20,495
<font color="yellow">It was a miracle I got into
this company. I can't quit on my own.</font>

209
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:24,841
<font color="yellow">Sung-sik will keep on bothering you.
Are you going to put up with that?</font>

210
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:26,942
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

211
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:31,815
<font color="yellow">To my family and me,
this company is like our lifeline.</font>

212
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,854
<font color="yellow">I'll provide for you.</font>

213
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,260
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

214
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,294
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

215
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,725
<font color="yellow">I don't want to give up my work
just because I like you.</font>

216
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,112
<font color="yellow">Fine! Fine!</font>

217
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:46,970
<font color="yellow">Instead, if Sung-sik
bothers you again, you better</font>

218
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,995
<font color="yellow">not hide it and tell me right away! Got it?</font>

219
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:51,558
<font color="yellow">And I'll meet Sung-sik separately on my own.</font>

220
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:54,572
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Mr. Bang on my own.</font>

221
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,995
<font color="yellow">When the two of you meet up,
the situation gets worse,</font>

222
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,027
<font color="yellow">and you guys end up
beating each other up!</font>

223
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:01,619
<font color="yellow">Just let me handle my own issues.</font>

224
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:03,919
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you trust me, don't you?</font>

225
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:06,996
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

226
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:12,067
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you haven't
forgotten what I said, right?</font>

227
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,855
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens, you can't be swayed.</font>

228
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:17,171
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

229
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,498
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

230
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,506
<font color="yellow">You can go in through the front gate here.</font>

231
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,283
<font color="yellow">I can't go through here.</font>

232
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,733
<font color="yellow">Of course you can.</font>

233
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,068
<font color="yellow">It's okay if you go in with me. Come on.</font>

234
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,085
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

235
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,106
<font color="yellow">Are you disrespecting me?</font>

236
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,134
<font color="yellow">I told you several times
not to go through this way.</font>

237
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:46,656
<font color="yellow">Did you think I was joking?</font>

238
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,566
<font color="yellow">Get out. Get out at once!</font>

239
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,710
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

240
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:54,124
<font color="yellow">- Why are you just standing there? Get out!
- Mom!</font>

241
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,616
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

242
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,774
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, what are you doing?</font>

243
00:15:58,671 --> 00:15:59,671
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

244
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:02,920
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong.
- Lee Jang-go!</font>

245
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,155
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

246
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:09,522
<font color="yellow">Why are you guys shouting in the front yard?</font>

247
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:11,719
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say,
come inside and say it!</font>

248
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,912
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing
yelling at me in front of her?</font>

249
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:27,974
<font color="yellow">Was it so wrong of her to use the front
gate when we live in the same house?</font>

250
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,217
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you're being too harsh?</font>

251
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,177
<font color="yellow">How am I being too harsh?</font>

252
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,142
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to see her,
so I told her not to go through there.</font>

253
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,930
<font color="yellow">Isn't it her fault for
not listening to my words?</font>

254
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:42,368
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong is the woman I like!
She's my girlfriend!</font>

255
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:44,983
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

256
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:46,678
<font color="yellow">The woman you like?</font>

257
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:48,413
<font color="yellow">Girlfriend?</font>

258
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:52,914
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? What about Ha-yeon?</font>

259
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:56,943
<font color="yellow">Mom, stop talking about Ha-yeon!
I'm through with her!</font>

260
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:01,224
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, Ha-yeon is still waiting for you.</font>

261
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:05,349
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon isn't angry at you anymore!
Are you going to mess things up again?</font>

262
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:08,832
<font color="yellow">Mom, please! Stop talking about her!</font>

263
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:11,892
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's wrong with you?</font>

264
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:15,060
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, aren't you being too much?</font>

265
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:17,842
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back to
your mom who raised you all this</font>

266
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:20,154
<font color="yellow">time! Are you sure you're
the eldest son in this house?</font>

267
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,816
<font color="yellow">Up until now, you never worried me!</font>

268
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,949
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's wrong with you?</font>

269
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,095
<font color="yellow">What do we have?</font>

270
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:32,877
<font color="yellow">I want to make you a shade
you can be protected in!</font>

271
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:35,523
<font color="yellow">How can you not understand my feelings?</font>

272
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:40,873
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

273
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:50,669
<font color="yellow">I don't know whose side I need to take.</font>

274
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:13,763
<font color="yellow">Then grandfather's huge inheritance...</font>

275
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,503
<font color="yellow">belongs to Mi-poong?</font>

276
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,044
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

277
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:41,576
<font color="yellow">God.</font>

278
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,490
<font color="yellow">God, if you're there, answer me.</font>

279
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,762
<font color="yellow">Does someone like me not deserve to be happy?</font>

280
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:56,731
<font color="yellow">God, if you're there, answer me!</font>

281
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:11,051
<font color="yellow">- (My Rope)
- It's my rotten rope.</font>

282
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:17,919
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

283
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,742
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, where are you right now?</font>

284
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:22,403
<font color="yellow">I came to meet my friend.</font>

285
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:23,904
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

286
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:28,009
<font color="yellow">Something big happened at home.
Hurry up and come home. Hurry.</font>

287
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:31,564
<font color="yellow">I heard you were home when it happened.</font>

288
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:36,990
<font color="yellow">I can't believe my grandfather's biological
granddaughter is alive! Isn't it dramatic?</font>

289
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,575
<font color="yellow">Dramatic?</font>

290
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:44,646
<font color="yellow">My grandfather lived his whole life missing
his wife and family in North Korea.</font>

291
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:48,988
<font color="yellow">Everyone else passed away, but I hope
he can find his granddaughter.</font>

292
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,285
<font color="yellow">How can he say something so ridiculous?</font>

293
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:56,724
<font color="yellow">Everything is being taken away from him,
and yet, he's really okay with that?</font>

294
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:59,569
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm going to China
tomorrow with my father</font>

295
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,949
<font color="yellow">and grandfather to help them
find his granddaughter.</font>

296
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:04,516
<font color="yellow">I won't be here for a while. Will you be okay?</font>

297
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,316
<font color="yellow">But Shin-ae, what's wrong?</font>

298
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

299
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:14,096
<font color="yellow">No, I'm just tired.</font>

300
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,741
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wash up.</font>

301
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:21,930
<font color="yellow">Sure. Since you're tired,
I'll pack my travel bag by myself.</font>

302
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:35,919
<font color="yellow">Honey,</font>

303
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,594
<font color="yellow">am I wrong?</font>

304
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,489
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

305
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:43,904
<font color="yellow">I'm not, right?</font>

306
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:53,353
<font color="yellow">I'm growing older, and I want to make a
sturdy windbreak for Jang-go and Jang-soo.</font>

307
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:56,972
<font color="yellow">That's why I want Jang-go
and Ha-yeon to be together.</font>

308
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,721
<font color="yellow">Later on, Jang-go will definitely regret it.</font>

309
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:07,255
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to see Jang-go
and Jang-soo turn out well?</font>

310
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:13,989
<font color="yellow">Can't you help me so that
Jang-go can change his mind?</font>

311
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:29,020
<font color="yellow">I went to the temple and asked
your father what I should do about you.</font>

312
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:35,427
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think about it,
there's only one way to solve this.</font>

313
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,263
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go,</font>

314
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,739
<font color="yellow">think very well before you answer me.</font>

315
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:48,880
<font color="yellow">Choose.</font>

316
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:54,161
<font color="yellow">Choose either me or Mi-poong, that brat.</font>

317
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,642
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- No need to waste words.</font>

318
00:21:58,638 --> 00:21:59,638
<font color="yellow">Just answer me.</font>

319
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,157
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me to
choose between you and her?</font>

320
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:09,286
<font color="yellow">Both of you are equally precious to me.</font>

321
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:12,226
<font color="yellow">We're equally precious?</font>

322
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,466
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that you'll never
give up on Mi-poong, right?</font>

323
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,693
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll never give up on her.</font>

324
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:27,825
<font color="yellow">Then I'll choose.</font>

325
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,171
<font color="yellow">If you can't give up on Mi-poong,
I'll give up on you.</font>

326
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,333
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

327
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,633
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, get out of this house.</font>

328
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,621
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Get out at once!</font>

329
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:48,677
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

330
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,591
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil! Geum-sil, what's wrong with you?</font>

331
00:22:56,936 --> 00:23:00,275
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, are you seriously
kicking Jang-go out?</font>

332
00:23:00,373 --> 00:23:01,373
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil!</font>

333
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:12,122
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, get out!
Get out at once, Lee Jang-go!</font>

334
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:14,662
<font color="yellow">Don't do this, Geum-sil!</font>

335
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:19,529
<font color="yellow">Mother, Jang-go isn't my son anymore.</font>

336
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,348
<font color="yellow">You just lost your eldest grandson, too!</font>

337
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:25,193
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get out!</font>

338
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:31,968
<font color="yellow">If you won't give up that brat,
I'll give you up!</font>

339
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:36,715
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and live with that girl!
Do as you please!</font>

340
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,299
<font color="yellow">You're not my son anymore.</font>

341
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:41,860
<font color="yellow">I don't need a son like you!
Get out! Get out at once!</font>

342
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,155
<font color="yellow">You horrible brat!</font>

343
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,167
<font color="yellow">Are you happy cutting off our ties?</font>

344
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:57,738
<font color="yellow">Fine! I'm going to watch how happy you
live after destroying our family like this!</font>

345
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,544
<font color="yellow">Awful brat.</font>

346
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:01,294
<font color="yellow">Mother, go in. Nam-yi, you, too.</font>

347
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,474
<font color="yellow">- Go in! Go in!
- Okay!</font>

348
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,942
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, go and beg for forgiveness. Hurry.</font>

349
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,638
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm sorry.</font>

350
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,546
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, I'm sorry.</font>

351
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,354
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, come here!</font>

352
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:29,857
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

353
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,872
<font color="yellow">Why are you making things worse?</font>

354
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,481
<font color="yellow">How will you deal with cutting off their ties?</font>

355
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:50,238
<font color="yellow">Do you think you and Jang-go will be
happy if you two get married like this?</font>

356
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,047
<font color="yellow">This is why I opposed this!</font>

357
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:56,428
<font color="yellow">Jang-go says he likes you now,</font>

358
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,699
<font color="yellow">but how long will it last
after he threw his mother away?</font>

359
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:01,731
<font color="yellow">No child can ever throw their parents away!</font>

360
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,016
<font color="yellow">On top of that, Jang-go is the eldest son!</font>

361
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:07,710
<font color="yellow">And even though Jang-go
turns his back on his mother,</font>

362
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:12,200
<font color="yellow">you two will never be happy!</font>

363
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:14,864
<font color="yellow">This is wrong, Mi-poong.</font>

364
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,527
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is make up your mind!
Why are you being so foolish?</font>

365
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:20,166
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this, too?</font>

366
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,754
<font color="yellow">Then what will you do?</font>

367
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,203
<font color="yellow">What will you do when
his family is reacting this way?</font>

368
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,899
<font color="yellow">Still, I can't give Jang-go up.</font>

369
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,279
<font color="yellow">I promised him.</font>

370
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:33,294
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

371
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:44,621
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, have a safe trip.</font>

372
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,051
<font color="yellow">I will pray for good news.</font>

373
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:49,955
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

374
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:53,341
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, father.</font>

375
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:57,100
<font color="yellow">Be safe while I'm away. I'll call you.</font>

376
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:03,266
<font color="yellow">Mom, you can't give my wife
a hard time while I'm away.</font>

377
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,429
<font color="yellow">Then I'll fly back from China right away.</font>

378
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:11,189
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Honey! Sweetheart!</font>

379
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,852
<font color="yellow">If there is any news, make sure you call me.</font>

380
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:17,857
<font color="yellow">You must!</font>

381
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,150
<font color="yellow">I told you I would so many times!</font>

382
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,559
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

383
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:22,717
<font color="yellow">Have a safe trip!</font>

384
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:25,603
<font color="yellow">Bye, father.</font>

385
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,641
<font color="yellow">The granddaughter you're looking
for is right next to you in Korea.</font>

386
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:33,784
<font color="yellow">You're going all the way to China though.</font>

387
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,224
<font color="yellow">How pitiful.</font>

388
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:38,822
<font color="yellow">What do we do now?</font>

389
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:43,317
<font color="yellow">Now that father directly stepped in, it's only
a matter of time before they find her!</font>

390
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,787
<font color="yellow">All my efforts are about to go to waste!</font>

391
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:50,192
<font color="yellow">Mom, what if we have to leave this house?</font>

392
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:54,137
<font color="yellow">Come on. China isn't a small country, you know!</font>

393
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,855
<font color="yellow">It's hard to find anyone
in the streets of Seoul.</font>

394
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,424
<font color="yellow">How will he be able to find her
in such a wide piece of land?</font>

395
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:05,816
<font color="yellow">It'll be difficult for him to find her
in his lifetime, so don't you worry.</font>

396
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,914
<font color="yellow">Your efforts won't go to waste so easily.</font>

397
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,964
<font color="yellow">You're right, grandmother.</font>

398
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,878
<font color="yellow">She might not be in China either.</font>

399
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:19,028
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong says he hopes grandfather finds her.</font>

400
00:27:20,043 --> 00:27:22,809
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault!</font>

401
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:26,988
<font color="yellow">Why else would his granddaughter
appear out of nowhere?</font>

402
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:30,762
<font color="yellow">This happened because bad luck
like you came into the house!</font>

403
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,149
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out right now!</font>

404
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,841
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Chung-ja!</font>

405
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:39,681
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
Why are you being like this to her?</font>

406
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:44,114
<font color="yellow">No matter how angry you are, you shouldn't
be so rude to kind Shin-ae! Stop it!</font>

407
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:45,746
<font color="yellow">Kind Shin-ae?</font>

408
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,793
<font color="yellow">You don't know how frightening she is!</font>

409
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:54,359
<font color="yellow">She's a defector! She's from North Korea!</font>

410
00:27:54,871 --> 00:28:00,027
<font color="yellow">But she lied to us that she was from
Sokcho and came into our home!</font>

411
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:03,057
<font color="yellow">She lied to us all!</font>

412
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,879
<font color="yellow">A defector from North Korea?</font>

413
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:09,559
<font color="yellow">- Oh my gosh!
- Yes, mom!</font>

414
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,312
<font color="yellow">Get out, you unlucky wench!</font>

415
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,813
<font color="yellow">Blood! Blood!</font>

416
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,590
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

417
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:29,942
<font color="yellow">I'll leave.</font>

418
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,332
<font color="yellow">I'll leave!</font>

419
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,537
<font color="yellow">Is it such a big crime to be a defector?</font>

420
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:41,708
<font color="yellow">How dare you disrespect me when
you're living off of this house, too?</font>

421
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:44,778
<font color="yellow">Even a worm will turn once it's stepped on!</font>

422
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:49,393
<font color="yellow">And you keep calling me a defector.</font>

423
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,605
<font color="yellow">We're from the same land
and speak the same language!</font>

424
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,442
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be like this!</font>

425
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,252
<font color="yellow">And even if you beg me to live here,
I won't, so don't worry!</font>

426
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:05,497
<font color="yellow">I don't have a bit of lingering
feelings for this house!</font>

427
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:14,745
<font color="yellow">Is she out of her mind, mom?</font>

428
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,099
<font color="yellow">Am I crazy?</font>

429
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:31,189
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I want to stay here
even if they're nice to me.</font>

430
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:34,023
<font color="yellow">I won't be a maid here any longer.</font>

431
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:39,030
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she realize that Hee-dong
will be the one to suffer if I leave?</font>

432
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:43,933
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

433
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:46,331
<font color="yellow">Why should I just leave?</font>

434
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:49,089
<font color="yellow">Even if I leave, I need to get my share.</font>

435
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:55,801
<font color="yellow">If I find his granddaughter for him,
I can get five million dollars.</font>

436
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:59,042
<font color="yellow">Won't I be able to get
at least five million dollars?</font>

437
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,370
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

438
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:02,792
<font color="yellow">That's it!</font>

439
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:06,245
<font color="yellow">He'll be able to pay me five million
dollars for his granddaughter!</font>

440
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:11,636
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

441
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,938
<font color="yellow">If I want to sell his granddaughter
to him, I need definite evidence!</font>

442
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,057
<font color="yellow">Goodness! This feels warm and nice!</font>

443
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:51,761
<font color="yellow">Coming here makes my day!</font>

444
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,518
<font color="yellow">I feel comfortable here, too.
If I'm home, all I get is a headache.</font>

445
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:00,287
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil has an unhealthy taste for money.</font>

446
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,302
<font color="yellow">Or maybe she's so tired
from raising Jang-go and</font>

447
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,480
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo on her own
after her husband passed away.</font>

448
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:09,163
<font color="yellow">She isn't her old self.</font>

449
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,956
<font color="yellow">How can she be so brutal to him?</font>

450
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:15,799
<font color="yellow">It's because she covets Ha-yeon so much.</font>

451
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:17,922
<font color="yellow">I think Jang-go is being too harsh.</font>

452
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,628
<font color="yellow">His mom really wants this.</font>

453
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:22,979
<font color="yellow">Would it be so hard for him to marry Ha-yeon?</font>

454
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:24,471
<font color="yellow">It's mind over matter.</font>

455
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:30,424
<font color="yellow">Hey, you can't get over love so easily.</font>

456
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:33,137
<font color="yellow">Why do you think there is such a thing as being</font>

457
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:35,737
<font color="yellow">lovesick? People can die when they're in love.</font>

458
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:40,315
<font color="yellow">But why is Mr. Kim late today?</font>

459
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:47,789
<font color="yellow">He said he's single.
Is he a bachelor or a divorcee?</font>

460
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:49,854
<font color="yellow">I should've asked him.</font>

461
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:54,167
<font color="yellow">I think he's a bachelor. He's very neat.</font>

462
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,737
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, by any chance, do you...?</font>

463
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:01,925
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

464
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,284
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Hello.</font>

465
00:32:06,949 --> 00:32:10,417
<font color="yellow">But who is he? Your nephew?</font>

466
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

467
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:14,409
<font color="yellow">He's my son.</font>

468
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:16,511
<font color="yellow">Son?</font>

469
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:19,565
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, say hi.</font>

470
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:23,307
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Kim Won-bin.</font>

471
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,253
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

472
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:46,136
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

473
00:32:46,644 --> 00:32:49,057
<font color="yellow">You were kicked out of the house?</font>

474
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:50,738
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

475
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,784
<font color="yellow">They found out I was a defector.</font>

476
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,745
<font color="yellow">Still, how can you pack
your things and leave the house?</font>

477
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:00,511
<font color="yellow">You should've asked for forgiveness!</font>

478
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:03,659
<font color="yellow">You were wrong for lying anyways!</font>

479
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:10,482
<font color="yellow">I tried to endure it, too, by being their maid
and doing everything they wanted me to.</font>

480
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,175
<font color="yellow">What? Maid?</font>

481
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,824
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

482
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:17,109
<font color="yellow">But they won't treat me like I'm a human.</font>

483
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,495
<font color="yellow">They purposely take the curtains
down and make me wash</font>

484
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,996
<font color="yellow">them with my hands and
make up chores for me to do.</font>

485
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,759
<font color="yellow">They disrespect me like I'm some
kind of criminal and hit me.</font>

486
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,439
<font color="yellow">What? They hit you?</font>

487
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,799
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

488
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,831
<font color="yellow">They beat me like I'm some kind of dog.</font>

489
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:39,917
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

490
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:49,003
<font color="yellow">What's all this? How can
they do this to a person?</font>

491
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,768
<font color="yellow">That's why I left home.</font>

492
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:57,164
<font color="yellow">But I didn't have anywhere else
to go, so I came here.</font>

493
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,002
<font color="yellow">As a woman, I couldn't go to a motel by myself.</font>

494
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:06,870
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, please allow me
to stay here for a few days.</font>

495
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:10,917
<font color="yellow">I don't have anywhere else to go!</font>

496
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,159
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

497
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,367
<font color="yellow">Wait a little bit.</font>

498
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:33,034
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, I'm going to use your bathroom.</font>

499
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
<font color="yellow">The bathroom is outside.</font>

500
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,414
<font color="yellow">One of them belongs to Yoo-sung. Then
one of those two must belong to Mi-poong.</font>

501
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,761
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, this won't do.</font>

502
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:21,886
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go out for a moment.</font>

503
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,607
<font color="yellow">The food will be ready soon. Eat before you go.</font>

504
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,737
<font color="yellow">My back hurts so much.</font>

505
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:30,309
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the hospital.
I'll eat when I come back.</font>

506
00:35:30,777 --> 00:35:32,377
<font color="yellow">Why? Does it hurt a lot?</font>

507
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:34,316
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to go with you?</font>

508
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:35,824
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

509
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:38,315
<font color="yellow">I'll go by myself.</font>

510
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:45,288
<font color="yellow">No matter how much they hate her, how can they</font>

511
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:48,332
<font color="yellow">make her sick like that? Those terrible people!</font>

512
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:09,438
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Why is Hee-dong's
wife coming out of that house?</font>

513
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:27,854
<font color="yellow">Why would Shin-ae visit those
North Koreans who live behind our house?</font>

514
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:31,136
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

515
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:36,158
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, do you know that woman
who came out of your house just now?</font>

516
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,050
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

517
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,542
<font color="yellow">That woman who came out of
your house just now is my brother's wife.</font>

518
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:49,596
<font color="yellow">Why is she coming out of your house?
How do you know my sister-in-law?</font>

519
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,968
<font color="yellow">This is my grandfather-in-law's.</font>

520
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:00,722
<font color="yellow">One of these belong to his granddaughter.</font>

521
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:05,300
<font color="yellow">You can do a DNA test to find out if this
person is his real granddaughter, right?</font>

522
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,948
<font color="yellow">A DNA test for a grandfather and
his biological granddaughter?</font>

523
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:12,516
<font color="yellow">Yes. I want to find out if
she's really his granddaughter.</font>

524
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:19,412
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry but that cannot be
found through DNA testing.</font>

525
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:23,278
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it can't be found?</font>

526
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,786
<font color="yellow">If you were looking for a biological grandson,</font>

527
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,398
<font color="yellow">we can detect if they're related or not.</font>

528
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:32,098
<font color="yellow">But in the case of a granddaughter,
we can't find out</font>

529
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:34,035
<font color="yellow">if they're of blood relationship or not.</font>

530
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,604
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

531
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,027
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that
DNA testing can't prove</font>

532
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:42,368
<font color="yellow">if a grandfather and his granddaughter
are related or not?</font>

533
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:46,971
<font color="yellow">Yes. For women, we are unable
to find their biological grandfathers.</font>

534
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:02,558
<font color="yellow">So what does it mean when
they can't prove a grandfather</font>

535
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:06,395
<font color="yellow">and his granddaughter
are related through DNA testing?</font>

536
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:10,257
<font color="yellow">Does that mean that anyone
can be his granddaughter</font>

537
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:12,238
<font color="yellow">as long as she has
a different kind of evidence?</font>

538
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,363
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

539
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:19,308
<font color="yellow">That ring!</font>

540
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:25,761
<font color="yellow">As long as I have Ms. Joo's ring,
I can be his granddaughter, too!</font>

541
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,636
<font color="yellow">I can be grandfather's granddaughter
and the heiress of Winner's Group!</font>

542
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:42,815
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head!</font>

543
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,229
<font color="yellow">I must have gotten shocked after
Shin-ae left like that. Oh, my head!</font>

544
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:54,909
<font color="yellow">But what will you tell Mr. Kim, Dal-ho, and
Hee-dong when they ask you where she went?</font>

545
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:56,565
<font color="yellow">Goodness! I don't know!</font>

546
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,128
<font color="yellow">That's not important right now!</font>

547
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:02,254
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong will be so shocked!</font>

548
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:05,018
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!</font>

549
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:09,620
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Goodness! What is going on?</font>

550
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:11,347
<font color="yellow">Big news!</font>

551
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:12,753
<font color="yellow">Big news!</font>

552
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:17,267
<font color="yellow">Your grandma and I have a headache already!</font>

553
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,963
<font color="yellow">Don't open your mouth! I'm tired already!</font>

554
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:26,523
<font color="yellow">Mom, Shin-ae is a North Korean defector!</font>

555
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:29,573
<font color="yellow">She's from North Korea!</font>

556
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:33,449
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

557
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:35,019
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

558
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,373
<font color="yellow">Did you two know already?</font>

559
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:40,025
<font color="yellow">Am I the only one who didn't know?</font>

560
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,753
<font color="yellow">But why didn't you tell me this?</font>

561
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:45,829
<font color="yellow">Am I really not your daughter anymore?</font>

562
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:50,737
<font color="yellow">Where did you hear that anyways?
Is there a rumor</font>

563
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:53,063
<font color="yellow">going around that she's
a North Korean defector?</font>

564
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:58,713
<font color="yellow">It's not a rumor. A North Korean family
lives in the back of my in-laws' house.</font>

565
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:02,159
<font color="yellow">But Shin-ae was there a while ago!</font>

566
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:07,609
<font color="yellow">Your mom chased her out
after she got caught for lying to us</font>

567
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:10,860
<font color="yellow">about the fact that she
was a North Korean defector.</font>

568
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,159
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

569
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:14,909
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

570
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,934
<font color="yellow">Does Hee-dong know about this?</font>

571
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:19,198
<font color="yellow">What about grandfather and dad?</font>

572
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:22,557
<font color="yellow">They don't know. She deceived all of us!</font>

573
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:24,529
<font color="yellow">Only your mom and me know.</font>

574
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:26,956
<font color="yellow">This is totally a fraud marriage!</font>

575
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,120
<font color="yellow">This witch! How can she fool my kind brother?</font>

576
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:36,023
<font color="yellow">If Hee-dong finds out, he'll be shocked, and</font>

577
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,241
<font color="yellow">he might try to jump off the Han River Bridge.</font>

578
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:45,917
<font color="yellow">So don't blabber anything and keep your
mouth shut until I take care of this issue.</font>

579
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,979
<font color="yellow">Poor Hee-dong!</font>

580
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:55,877
<font color="yellow">That witch seduced your brother because
she coveted our family's inheritance.</font>

581
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:57,636
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

582
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,323
<font color="yellow">We're about to go under
because of that unlucky witch!</font>

583
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:05,464
<font color="yellow">This bitch!</font>

584
00:41:06,824 --> 00:41:08,359
<font color="yellow">I won't let her get away with this!</font>

585
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,481
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Hey!</font>

586
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:16,425
<font color="yellow">Mom, why did she have to come, too?</font>

587
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,064
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

588
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:22,400
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. I'm so scared imagining what will</font>

589
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:26,030
<font color="yellow">happen to us once father
finds his granddaughter!</font>

590
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:30,622
<font color="yellow">I don't know what his granddaughter
is like, but imagine what</font>

591
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:34,292
<font color="yellow">will happen once she gets married
and lives here in this house!</font>

592
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:38,737
<font color="yellow">If she tells us to leave this house,
we have no choice!</font>

593
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:41,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

594
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,481
<font color="yellow">I really hope he won't be able to find her.</font>

595
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:49,440
<font color="yellow">No! I wish she was dead and gone!</font>

596
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,886
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute, Chung-ja.</font>

597
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:56,763
<font color="yellow">Let's go find out if he will really
find his granddaughter or not.</font>

598
00:41:57,308 --> 00:41:58,911
<font color="yellow">Go where?</font>

599
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:19,054
<font color="yellow">Is it true that she's alive?</font>

600
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,158
<font color="yellow">That old man's granddaughter is really alive.</font>

601
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:25,291
<font color="yellow">She really is?</font>

602
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:28,819
<font color="yellow">Then is it true she's in China?</font>

603
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:33,050
<font color="yellow">She's not in China. She seems to be nearby.</font>

604
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:35,128
<font color="yellow">She's nearby?</font>

605
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:37,550
<font color="yellow">Nearby where?</font>

606
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,783
<font color="yellow">China is near here, too.</font>

607
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,887
<font color="yellow">China is closer to here than America.</font>

608
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,624
<font color="yellow">She's revolving around here.</font>

609
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:48,354
<font color="yellow">Tell them to come back!
Their efforts are fruitless!</font>

610
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:50,802
<font color="yellow">Their efforts are fruitless?</font>

611
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:52,878
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

612
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:57,182
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted! Fruitless efforts!</font>

613
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:03,108
<font color="yellow">Whether she's near or far, please make
sure my father won't ever be able to find her!</font>

614
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,534
<font color="yellow">Please! Please! Please!</font>

615
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:09,874
<font color="yellow">Isn't there a charm that makes
sure they will never meet?</font>

616
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:14,540
<font color="yellow">Is a charm not enough?</font>

617
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,048
<font color="yellow">Do we need to have an exorcism?</font>

618
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:26,534
<font color="yellow">Hey, you bitch!</font>

619
00:43:27,206 --> 00:43:30,534
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Don't call my name!</font>

620
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:36,018
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about my nice brother?</font>

621
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:40,221
<font color="yellow">How can you deceive us all
and come into our house?</font>

622
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:44,962
<font color="yellow">Did you covet our inheritance so much?
What are you going to do about Hee-dong?</font>

623
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:48,236
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!</font>

624
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:51,354
<font color="yellow">Goodness! What are you doing? Stop it!</font>

625
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:57,588
<font color="yellow">If something happens to
Hee-dong, I'll kill you!</font>

626
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,192
<font color="yellow">How can you downright lie
and marry my brother?</font>

627
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,550
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

628
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,050
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

629
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:19,417
<font color="yellow">Hey. What's going on? Huh?</font>

630
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:25,403
<font color="yellow">She deceived my entire family
by hiding the fact that</font>

631
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,902
<font color="yellow">she's a North Korean defector
and married my brother!</font>

632
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:30,816
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

633
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,128
<font color="yellow">Your sister-in-law is from North Korea, too?</font>

634
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,940
<font color="yellow">She got kicked out of our house,
so she's not my sister-in-law anymore.</font>

635
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,442
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?</font>

636
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,019
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

637
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,826
<font color="yellow">No, you're not.</font>

638
00:44:54,753 --> 00:44:56,445
<font color="yellow">You're not swaying already, are you?</font>

639
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,401
<font color="yellow">That's not it...</font>

640
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:03,503
<font color="yellow">Both of our mothers are so upset.</font>

641
00:45:04,378 --> 00:45:05,781
<font color="yellow">You're not able to go home either.</font>

642
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,169
<font color="yellow">Everyone is having a hard time.</font>

643
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:11,003
<font color="yellow">I told you we have to endure times like this.</font>

644
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,417
<font color="yellow">You can't become weak, okay?</font>

645
00:45:15,394 --> 00:45:17,127
<font color="yellow">Things will get better once time passes by.</font>

646
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:21,643
<font color="yellow">But are you really not going to go home?</font>

647
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:23,725
<font color="yellow">You should still go home.</font>

648
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,064
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will. I was going to anyways.</font>

649
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:32,971
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go.
- Yes?</font>

650
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:37,122
<font color="yellow">Do you really have the
confidence to not regret this?</font>

651
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,777
<font color="yellow">Regret what?</font>

652
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,425
<font color="yellow">You quit Jang & Ko because of me.</font>

653
00:45:43,347 --> 00:45:47,233
<font color="yellow">If you go back to working in
a small office, you'll struggle again.</font>

654
00:45:48,284 --> 00:45:51,257
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I can settle down by myself.</font>

655
00:45:51,824 --> 00:45:53,091
<font color="yellow">Don't you trust me?</font>

656
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,159
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

657
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:59,354
<font color="yellow">- I'm just worried you'll have to struggle again.
- Of course it'll take some time.</font>

658
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:03,154
<font color="yellow">But it's meaningful for me
to settle down by myself.</font>

659
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,331
<font color="yellow">I'll never regret this, so don't worry.</font>

660
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:10,487
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?
I'm going to eat it all then.</font>

661
00:46:10,512 --> 00:46:11,925
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll eat.</font>

662
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,029
<font color="yellow">(Director Bang Sung-sik)</font>

663
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,050
<font color="yellow">Is it Sung-sik?</font>

664
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,464
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's him.</font>

665
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:46,310
<font color="yellow">I didn't go to work today.</font>

666
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:51,787
<font color="yellow">Will you really be able to handle him?</font>

667
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,956
<font color="yellow">Go in first. I'm going to stop by the market.</font>

668
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:16,269
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

669
00:47:33,558 --> 00:47:34,691
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, get in.</font>

670
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,269
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

671
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:39,737
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.
Let's go talk somewhere.</font>

672
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,591
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything to say to you.</font>

673
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:45,425
<font color="yellow">If this doesn't have to do
with work, please leave.</font>

674
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,650
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy.</font>

675
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:51,526
<font color="yellow">You're not the only one who can say
something. I have something to tell you!</font>

676
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,331
<font color="yellow">Then tell me at work.</font>

677
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,241
<font color="yellow">Good-bye then.</font>

678
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,192
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, do I look easy to you?</font>

679
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:00,624
<font color="yellow">Just get in and stop talking!</font>

680
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:03,558
<font color="yellow">Don't do this!</font>

681
00:48:15,316 --> 00:48:16,316
<font color="yellow">Bang Sung-sik?</font>

682
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:19,792
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong!</font>

683
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:38,753
<font color="yellow">Stop the car.</font>

684
00:48:40,074 --> 00:48:41,407
<font color="yellow">I said stop the car!</font>

685
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:47,034
<font color="yellow">Bang Sung-sik.</font>

686
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:21,488
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

687
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,930
<font color="yellow">Mr. Bang, why are you doing this?</font>

688
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,038
<font color="yellow">Why are you bothering me by
forcing me to come with you?</font>

689
00:49:32,488 --> 00:49:34,583
<font color="yellow">You made me like this!</font>

690
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:39,346
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep making me
into a strange person?</font>

691
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:42,167
<font color="yellow">You don't pick up my calls
or answer my messages!</font>

692
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:44,173
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because you're disrespecting me!</font>

693
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:48,432
<font color="yellow">Who are you to make me
so pathetic? Who are you?</font>

694
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:50,503
<font color="yellow">Mr. Bang...</font>

695
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:59,534
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for yelling at you, but I really
want to be a gentle man to you.</font>

696
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,011
<font color="yellow">I don't want to yell at you.</font>

697
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,313
<font color="yellow">If you knew how I felt,
why would I act like this?</font>

698
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:11,660
<font color="yellow">I don't want to listen to this anymore.
I'll see you at work tomorrow.</font>

699
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,268
<font color="yellow">You're not going anywhere!</font>

700
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,164
<font color="yellow">You can't move one step
until I say you can leave!</font>

701
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,777
<font color="yellow">What's your reason for
stomping on my feelings like this?</font>

702
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,611
<font color="yellow">What am I lacking compared to Lee Jang-go?</font>

703
00:50:26,636 --> 00:50:29,792
<font color="yellow">Do I not have as much money as him
or am I not as good-looking as him?</font>

704
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:36,190
<font color="yellow">And do you know how much this ring costs?</font>

705
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:40,211
<font color="yellow">You're the first woman
I bought such a ring for!</font>

706
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:42,769
<font color="yellow">But why can't you realize my feelings?</font>

707
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:51,518
<font color="yellow">Don't do this, Mi-poong.
Take this ring back, please?</font>

708
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:54,578
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

709
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,745
<font color="yellow">What? You don't want to?</font>

710
00:50:58,777 --> 00:51:00,642
<font color="yellow">You still don't realize my sincerity?</font>

711
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:05,323
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll ever be able to
receive such a ring in your lifetime?</font>

712
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,405
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I'm a woman who has nothing.</font>

713
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,251
<font color="yellow">Don't like a lacking woman like me.
Find a great woman who suits you.</font>

714
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:23,706
<font color="yellow">Bang Sung-sik!</font>

715
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:29,409
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go, don't do this!
- What are you doing?</font>

716
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,534
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and hit me, you jerk!</font>

717
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:33,994
<font color="yellow">I'll just be beaten to death!</font>

718
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:35,417
<font color="yellow">Hit me!</font>

719
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:38,526
<font color="yellow">- Mi-poong!
- Jang-go!</font>

720
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,833
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to forgive you! Damn it!</font>

721
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,267
<font color="yellow">What's this? It's blood!</font>

722
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:54,245
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Bang Sung-sik,
why do you keep getting hit?</font>

723
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:56,979
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong!</font>

724
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:07,903
<font color="yellow">How will you be able to face
Sung-sik at work tomorrow?</font>

725
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:10,620
<font color="yellow">God, I'm already starting to worry.</font>

726
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:14,501
<font color="yellow">I'll deal with it tomorrow.</font>

727
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:17,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going to protest for him to
send me back to the marketing team.</font>

728
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,253
<font color="yellow">What? Protest?</font>

729
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:21,281
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

730
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

731
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,872
<font color="yellow">Or I'll at least make him
sign a contract that</font>

732
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:28,406
<font color="yellow">he'll never pull a stunt like
the one he pulled today.</font>

733
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:31,901
<font color="yellow">You're so brave.</font>

734
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:36,313
<font color="yellow">All right. As long as you think like that,
he won't be able to mess with you.</font>

735
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:38,214
<font color="yellow">Cheer up, Jang-go!</font>

736
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:39,714
<font color="yellow">Cheer up!</font>

737
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,959
<font color="yellow">Eat a lot. You need to eat a lot
to be healthy to overcome this.</font>

738
00:52:56,792 --> 00:53:01,815
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm fine. You should eat a lot.</font>

739
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:03,144
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

740
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,989
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, you eat a lot, too.</font>

741
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,391
<font color="yellow">Okay, aunt!</font>

742
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,297
<font color="yellow">Should you call me aunt or auntie?</font>

743
00:53:09,683 --> 00:53:13,804
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter.
He can call you whatever he wants.</font>

744
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,155
<font color="yellow">I want to call her "aunt."</font>

745
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,180
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

746
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,706
<font color="yellow">Sure, you can call me that.</font>

747
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:27,503
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee.</font>

748
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:36,807
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you doing right now?</font>

749
00:53:37,511 --> 00:53:42,917
<font color="yellow">Well, I called you, but you didn't pick up.</font>

750
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:45,137
<font color="yellow">I'll explain everything to you.</font>

751
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:48,005
<font color="yellow">What are you up to?</font>

752
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:52,397
<font color="yellow">No shame, no honor. How dare you
come here! Do you even have a conscience?</font>

753
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:55,133
<font color="yellow">Aunt, what's wrong?</font>

754
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:57,947
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Aunt Mi-poong is scary.</font>

755
00:53:57,972 --> 00:54:00,440
<font color="yellow">It's all right, Yoo-sung.</font>

756
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,628
<font color="yellow">Mom, how can you be eating dinner with her?</font>

757
00:54:05,886 --> 00:54:07,125
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, come in.</font>

758
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:21,452
<font color="yellow">She's in a pitiful situation.</font>

759
00:54:22,494 --> 00:54:25,238
<font color="yellow">Her mother-in-law found out
she was a defector and</font>

760
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,737
<font color="yellow">treated her harshly before she got kicked out.</font>

761
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:29,688
<font color="yellow">How can I just let her go?</font>

762
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:34,576
<font color="yellow">Mom, did you already forget what she did to us?</font>

763
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:40,174
<font color="yellow">I didn't forget it, but what's the
point of remembering it again?</font>

764
00:54:40,998 --> 00:54:44,641
<font color="yellow">On top of that, she begged for
forgiveness and is trying to live a new life.</font>

765
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:48,081
<font color="yellow">So Mi-poong,
let's understand her a little bit, okay?</font>

766
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,625
<font color="yellow">No, I can't do that.</font>

767
00:54:51,377 --> 00:54:55,353
<font color="yellow">It's her fault for lying and getting married!
Why do we have to help her out?</font>

768
00:54:55,737 --> 00:54:57,049
<font color="yellow">How can you be so spineless?</font>

769
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,529
<font color="yellow">Why would you let her inside the house?</font>

770
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,526
<font color="yellow">She had no choice but to come to us!</font>

771
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:07,562
<font color="yellow">She was trying to endure it,
but her mother-in-law</font>

772
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:11,181
<font color="yellow">beat her! Her whole body
is covered with bruises!</font>

773
00:55:11,568 --> 00:55:13,107
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for her.</font>

774
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:18,388
<font color="yellow">Fine. Do whatever you want.</font>

775
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:22,864
<font color="yellow">Instead, she can only stay for one night.
You must send her away tomorrow.</font>

776
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:43,117
<font color="yellow">No. If I take the ring like this,
they'll suspect me.</font>

777
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:48,911
<font color="yellow">How will I be able to
take that ring off of her?</font>

778
00:57:49,693 --> 00:57:50,693
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

779
00:57:52,154 --> 00:57:55,906
<font color="yellow">I need that ring to grab the golden rope again!</font>

780
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,716
<font color="yellow">Is that bean paste soup? It smells delicious.</font>

781
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:19,239
<font color="yellow">It's soybean paste soup
with dried radish leaves.</font>

782
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:21,224
<font color="yellow">Come and taste it.</font>

783
00:58:24,591 --> 00:58:25,710
<font color="yellow">It's hot. Be careful.</font>

784
00:58:26,818 --> 00:58:27,818
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

785
00:58:29,162 --> 00:58:31,469
<font color="yellow">The seasoning is just right. It tastes great.</font>

786
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:36,109
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm going to work.</font>

787
00:58:37,302 --> 00:58:39,497
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there an emergency at work?</font>

788
00:58:39,873 --> 00:58:41,271
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat breakfast?</font>

789
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:43,542
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat with her.</font>

790
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:45,263
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

791
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,857
<font color="yellow">Don't ever come back to our house again.</font>

792
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,466
<font color="yellow">When I see your face, I think about
how much we suffered in China.</font>

793
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:54,685
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

794
00:58:54,872 --> 00:58:59,365
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, I'm sorry. I was wrong.</font>

795
00:59:00,193 --> 00:59:02,570
<font color="yellow">If you're sorry, don't come back here again.</font>

796
00:59:14,146 --> 00:59:16,318
<font color="yellow">Don't resent Mi-poong.</font>

797
00:59:17,256 --> 00:59:18,256
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

798
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:24,974
<font color="yellow">I won't. I hurt you and Mi-poong.</font>

799
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,638
<font color="yellow">Serves me right.</font>

800
00:59:29,677 --> 00:59:32,763
<font color="yellow">Do you have a place to go if you leave here?</font>

801
00:59:33,271 --> 00:59:35,107
<font color="yellow">I should go back home.</font>

802
00:59:35,935 --> 00:59:39,026
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live as if
I'm going to die in that house.</font>

803
00:59:39,888 --> 00:59:41,631
<font color="yellow">Yes, you should.</font>

804
00:59:46,888 --> 00:59:49,388
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, thank you.</font>

805
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,841
<font color="yellow">No problem.
Even if they treat you poorly,</font>

806
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:55,435
<font color="yellow">if you act sincerely,
they'll recognize you one day.</font>

807
00:59:56,045 --> 01:00:01,568
<font color="yellow">On top of that, Mr. Jo is a good person,
so endure it for him and your husband.</font>

808
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,903
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

809
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:16,927
<font color="yellow">What can I do? What can I do
to take that ring off of her?</font>

810
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:18,357
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

811
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,490
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

812
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:29,197
<font color="yellow">is for you to buy your mother-in-law's
favorite fruits before you go home.</font>

813
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,286
<font color="yellow">It's fine. You can use it.</font>

814
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:36,802
<font color="yellow">I want to give it to you, so accept it.</font>

815

<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

818
01:00:58,326 --> 01:01:00,091
<font color="yellow">I either die or live.</font>

819
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:06,864
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo will live without that ring,
but if I don't have that ring, I'll die.</font>
