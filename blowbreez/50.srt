<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 50)</font>

3
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I'll do it.</font>

4
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:17,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

5
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:20,593
<font color=#FFFF00>it's me, Seung-hee.</font>

6
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:24,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm living well here in South Korea</font>

7
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:33,896
<font color=#FFFF00>using the name, Kim Mi-poong, you gave me.</font>

8
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:41,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong.</font>

9
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,662
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you remember the name you gave me?</font>

10
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:55,287
<font color=#FFFF00>All this time, mom and I thought you had passed away.</font>

11
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,615
<font color=#FFFF00>So we didn't think of finding you.</font>

12
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:07,912
<font color=#FFFF00>But we think we saw you here in South Korea.</font>

13
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:12,248
<font color=#FFFF00>The person we saw is you, isn't it?</font>

14
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:18,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, you're alive, aren't you?</font>

15
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,717
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss you so much.</font>

16
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:24,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad...</font>

17
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:28,771
<font color=#FFFF00>let's make sure we meet.</font>

18
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

19
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,008
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't recognize you.</font>

20
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:45,842
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong.</font>

21
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:47,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong.</font>

22
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You were my granddaughter.</font>

23
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:58,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho.</font>

24
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,389
<font color=#FFFF00>She's really my granddaughter, isn't she?</font>

25
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mr. Kim.</font>

26
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,616
<font color=#FFFF00>She is.</font>

27
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,286
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen?</font>

28
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:18,145
<font color=#FFFF00>My granddaughter was next to me all this time, but I didn't know.</font>

29
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:20,896
<font color=#FFFF00>My Mi-poong.</font>

30
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:23,818
<font color=#FFFF00>My Yoo-sung.</font>

31
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:27,969
<font color=#FFFF00>My daughter-in-law.</font>

32
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:35,036
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do I find you?</font>

33
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,106
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

35
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,076
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

36
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,443
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, he was able to locate Mi-poong and Ms. Joo's location</font>

37
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:02,123
<font color=#FFFF00>from the hospital where Yoo-sung had been admitted at.</font>

38
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:03,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

39
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is it?</font>

40
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go. Quickly!</font>

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,764
<font color=#FFFF00>(Motel)</font>

42
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:27,569
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean they left? When did they leave?</font>

43
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:28,927
<font color=#FFFF00>It hasn't been long.</font>

44
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,443
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you here for the debt as well?</font>

45
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,639
<font color=#FFFF00>Debt? What debt?</font>

46
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,334
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not those kind of people.</font>

47
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,193
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the grandfather of the young lady who was here.</font>

48
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know where they went?</font>

49
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't know. They were behind on the room rent, but those</font>

50
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:48,942
<font color=#FFFF00>loan sharks came barging in here suddenly, so I chased them out.</font>

51
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:51,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Loan sharks barged in here?</font>

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even get me started. It seemed like the little one was sick.</font>

53
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:57,162
<font color=#FFFF00>Yet, those loan sharks took all the money, even the room rent.</font>

54
00:03:57,187 --> 00:04:01,982
<font color=#FFFF00>They even took the ring on her finger and kicked the door loudly. My goodness!</font>

55
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:04,834
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim!</font>

56
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:09,325
<font color=#FFFF00>They were in such a rush that they ran out of here without even the time to think!</font>

57
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you say you're her grandfather, take these with you.</font>

58
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,991
<font color=#FFFF00>(We are looking for a person)</font>

59
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:41,749
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

60
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:45,529
<font color=#FFFF00>They were looking for us.</font>

61
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't even know that.</font>

62
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:53,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, Mi-poong would never do such a thing.</font>

63
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,835
<font color=#FFFF00>If that's what you're here to discuss, please go back.</font>

64
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim!</font>

65
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help her this one time. I can't let her</font>

66
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:02,952
<font color=#FFFF00>be unjustly accused for something she didn't do.</font>

67
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:07,007
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, please help her just this once.</font>

68
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,133
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, if one did something wrong, then one should receive the punishment.</font>

69
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:15,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how much damage Kim Mi-poong had caused to the company?</font>

70
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:19,025
<font color=#FFFF00>If we accommodated you this much, you should be grateful.</font>

71
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,935
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she be so shameless?</font>

72
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:23,381
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

73
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,392
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how hard it is to live, there are things you should do and shouldn't do.</font>

74
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:30,709
<font color=#FFFF00>You tried to get help from another woman's husband, and</font>

75
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,381
<font color=#FFFF00>your daughter sought after illegal funds from her workplace.</font>

76
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,396
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you live any way you please?</font>

77
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,779
<font color=#FFFF00>You should try to live hard with your own efforts.</font>

78
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you learn such terrible things from?</font>

79
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:44,287
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, what are you talking about?</font>

80
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,365
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

81
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,271
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

82
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

83
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Who on earth won't let us meet Mi-poong's grandfather?</font>

84
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,588
<font color=#FFFF00>They even made up a fake one.</font>

85
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:27,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Who can it be?</font>

86
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

87
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:36,334
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, but do you know Mr. Kim Han-cheon?</font>

88
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim Han-cheon?</font>

89
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,092
<font color=#FFFF00>No. You got the wrong number.</font>

90
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:45,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what about Mr. Kim Bok-dong?</font>

91
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,313
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I don't know him.</font>

92
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,337
<font color=#FFFF00>You got the wrong number.</font>

93
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,576
<font color=#FFFF00>You really don't know him?</font>

94
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you prank-calling from?</font>

95
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know him!</font>

96
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on!</font>

97
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:08,084
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance, are you Mr. Jo's wife?</font>

98
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

99
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,966
<font color=#FFFF00>You are Mr. Jo's wife!</font>

100
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,500
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm not! You got the wrong number!</font>

101
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't that Mi-poong's mom?</font>

102
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Han-cheon? Kim Bok-dong? That's that old man from last time!</font>

103
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:31,943
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she asking me about that old man?</font>

104
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:35,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she find out he's the fake one?</font>

105
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,389
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do?</font>

106
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,757
<font color=#FFFF00>It's definitely that woman.</font>

107
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

108
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,396
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mi-poong! - Did you call the number?</font>

109
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,115
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, what's wrong?</font>

110
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:55,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, this number seems to belong to that woman! Mr. Jo's wife!</font>

111
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,412
<font color=#FFFF00>By Mr. Jo's wife, you mean Shin-ae's mother-in-law?</font>

112
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,592
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes!</font>

113
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:05,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, stay with Yoo-sung. I'm going to check this out myself.</font>

114
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,762
<font color=#FFFF00>If it really is that woman, I'm going to demand for an explanation.</font>

115
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,263
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, let me go with you.</font>

116
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,740
<font color=#FFFF00>No. Stay with Yoo-sung. I'll be back soon.</font>

117
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,061
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom...</font>

118
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:19,764
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. Why would she do such a thing?</font>

119
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,474
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a big problem, Shin-ae!</font>

120
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,646
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong's mom called me to ask if I knew who Mr. Kim Han-cheon was.</font>

121
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is Mr. Kim Han-cheon?</font>

122
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:46,889
<font color=#FFFF00>You know Mi-poong's fake grandfather! We gave him that name!</font>

123
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother! Someone will hear you!</font>

124
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:50,654
<font color=#FFFF00>No one is home!</font>

125
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,826
<font color=#FFFF00>How does she know that old man, and why did she call you?</font>

126
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:02,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she call knowing that Mi-poong's real grandfather is Mr. Kim?</font>

127
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:04,154
<font color=#FFFF00>What do we do then?</font>

128
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,807
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not true.</font>

129
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:10,951
<font color=#FFFF00>If she knew that, would she have called to ask if you know that old man?</font>

130
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:13,795
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true...</font>

131
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:15,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh.</font>

132
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,576
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello? Go on.</font>

133
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,131
<font color=#FFFF00>What? She's heading towards our house right now?</font>

134
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,342
<font color=#FFFF00>- Right now? - All right. I got it.</font>

135
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is heading towards our house right now?</font>

136
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong's mom is on her way to our house right now.</font>

137
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:42,100
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it may be because of that.</font>

138
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:46,622
<font color=#FFFF00>So you were keeping an eye on Mi-poong's family all this time?</font>

139
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:50,894
<font color=#FFFF00>Go outside and meet her. If she asks you about that</font>

140
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:54,186
<font color=#FFFF00>old man, firmly tell her you don't know anything!</font>

141
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:56,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Me?</font>

142
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Then do I go? She called you!</font>

143
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,857
<font color=#FFFF00>If I got out an explain, then she'll get suspicious!</font>

144
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:04,795
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

145
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:15,381
<font color=#FFFF00>It's that woman! It's her! What do I do?</font>

146
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,982
<font color=#FFFF00>What do we do if she runs into grandfather or dad?</font>

147
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,903
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, hurry up and go out and take her far</font>

148
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:29,740
<font color=#FFFF00>away from here! Do something about this! Hurry!</font>

149
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:31,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm coming!</font>

150
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry!</font>

151
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:43,576
<font color=#FFFF00>S-She didn't come here knowing everything, did she?</font>

152
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:50,788
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know?</font>

153
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,519
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the phone number that the old man gave me.</font>

154
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:00,680
<font color=#FFFF00>It's your phone number, isn't it?</font>

155
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,186
<font color=#FFFF00>You still don't know?</font>

156
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:09,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how he gave you my phone number, but I don't know him.</font>

157
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:11,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

158
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:14,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Then let's bring that old man and have a three-party encounter.</font>

159
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, fine! I did it!</font>

160
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:19,952
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

161
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,486
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do such a thing?</font>

162
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:31,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you make up a fake grandfather to prevent us from finding the real one?</font>

163
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:35,057
<font color=#FFFF00>You know who Mi-poong's real grandfather is, don't you?</font>

164
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,674
<font color=#FFFF00>How would I know that?</font>

165
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:40,699
<font color=#FFFF00>You do know him! If we find her real grandfather, it'll be a</font>

166
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:44,117
<font color=#FFFF00>disadvantage towards you! Isn't that why you did such an awful thing?</font>

167
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:47,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh! What are you talking about?</font>

168
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:51,703
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would it be a disadvantage for me if you found Mi-poong's grandfather?</font>

169
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:54,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why did you do this? Why?</font>

170
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

171
00:11:57,836 --> 00:11:59,461
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know why I did this?</font>

172
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,328
<font color=#FFFF00>You tenacious woman!</font>

173
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,016
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

174
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,711
<font color=#FFFF00>You shameless woman!</font>

175
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,854
<font color=#FFFF00>You stole my husband and ruined my family, and</font>

176
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,586
<font color=#FFFF00>yet, you want to find your father-in-law?</font>

177
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,710
<font color=#FFFF00>If there was still a law against adultery, I</font>

178
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,539
<font color=#FFFF00>would've locked you up in a prison a long time ago!</font>

179
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:22,461
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I wanted to put you through trouble! So what?</font>

180
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you ruined my family, you deserve this punishment!</font>

181
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,539
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think you're doing? - Hey!</font>

182
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,846
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you crazy woman.</font>

183
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,398
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do such a terrible thing?</font>

184
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:44,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever considered the feelings of people</font>

185
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,352
<font color=#FFFF00>who live with the hope of finding their family?</font>

186
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:51,064
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to kill you with my own bare hands, but I</font>

187
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,807
<font color=#FFFF00>don't want to dirty them, so I'm just leaving.</font>

188
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:01,622
<font color=#FFFF00>How terrifying! She said she wants to kill me!</font>

189
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:05,234
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness. What did she say? I'm speechless!</font>

190
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,531
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm utterly speechless!</font>

191
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:11,516
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

192
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,781
<font color=#FFFF00>You ended up confessing that you were the one who did it?</font>

193
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:16,352
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

194
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother!</font>

195
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,866
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to deny it, but how could you confess that you did it instead?</font>

196
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,008
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no choice.</font>

197
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:28,437
<font color=#FFFF00>She was going to do a three-party encounter. What else was I supposed to do?</font>

198
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think she's going to let this slide?</font>

199
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:34,539
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll definitely suspect me now.</font>

200
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:39,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Then she'll realize that my grandfather is actually Mi-poong's grandfather!</font>

201
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,321
<font color=#FFFF00>No, she won't.</font>

202
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:45,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her the reason I did that was because I</font>

203
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:48,219
<font color=#FFFF00>was angry at her for bewitching my husband.</font>

204
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,000
<font color=#FFFF00>It seemed like she believed me.</font>

205
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,664
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you believe it if you were her?</font>

206
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:58,281
<font color=#FFFF00>It's possible...</font>

207
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,531
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi. It's me.</font>

208
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing strange happened at the new motel she was staying at, right?</font>

209
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:18,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Then send me the phone number of the loan sharks they borrowed money from.</font>

210
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:21,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you need the loan sharks?</font>

211
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,062
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

212
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have a way?</font>

213
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,883
<font color=#FFFF00>This won't do. I need to make sure Mi-poong's family is far away from here.</font>

214
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,383
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the money that Kim Mi-poong owes.</font>

215
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I put in enough money for the interest.</font>

216
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,797
<font color=#FFFF00>You're paying her debt back for her?</font>

217
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,961
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you have a request to ask me.</font>

218
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,328
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a service fee.</font>

219
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,633
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure Kim Mi-poong doesn't appear in Seoul again.</font>

220
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:20,750
<font color=#FFFF00>If you can prevent her from coming here for one year, I'll pay you double the amount.</font>

221
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:23,953
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not hard at all.</font>

222
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,046
<font color=#FFFF00>We're professionals in that area.</font>

223
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,000
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll definitely take care of that for you.</font>

224
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,094
<font color=#FFFF00>Sounds good.</font>

225
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:49,774
<font color=#FFFF00>She really said that? But does that make any sense?</font>

226
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,101
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a crazy woman.</font>

227
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,234
<font color=#FFFF00>She came into our house last time when no one was home.</font>

228
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you serious?</font>

229
00:15:58,696 --> 00:15:59,750
<font color=#FFFF00>She's insane.</font>

230
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:05,672
<font color=#FFFF00>But mom, that old man said that an older woman and a younger lady had come to see him.</font>

231
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:07,703
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae?</font>

232
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,226
<font color=#FFFF00>Or that woman's daughter?</font>

233
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,258
<font color=#FFFF00>Something isn't right.</font>

234
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:16,577
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go to work.</font>

235
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,726
<font color=#FFFF00>You had work?</font>

236
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,316
<font color=#FFFF00>I called an employment agency, and they said if I fill in for someone for</font>

237
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:25,484
<font color=#FFFF00>the day, I would get paid double the amount, so I quickly took the job.</font>

238
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:28,045
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Be careful of cars.</font>

239
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,070
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be back soon.</font>

240
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:38,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would Shin-ae...?</font>

241
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:41,711
<font color=#FFFF00>It can't be Shin-ae.</font>

242
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:02,021
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, we're behind on deliveries, so can you wash</font>

243
00:17:02,046 --> 00:17:04,840
<font color=#FFFF00>the dishes later and go to a delivery right now?</font>

244
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, I'll go.</font>

245
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,446
<font color=#FFFF00>- Detective. - Hello.</font>

246
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that James Kang has entered the country?</font>

247
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:21,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we have information that he has entered Incheon this early morning.</font>

248
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:25,086
<font color=#FFFF00>He's on the watch list, so it's only a matter of time before he's caught.</font>

249
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? That's good.</font>

250
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:30,133
<font color=#FFFF00>Please call me as soon as he gets caught.</font>

251
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:33,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. I'll call you as soon as we catch this rascal.</font>

252
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:35,516
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

253
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:39,946
<font color=#FFFF00>- You must be busy, but I'm always asking favors from you. - It's fine.</font>

254
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:45,208
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a bit early for dinner, but would you like to get rice soup with me?</font>

255
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:49,538
<font color=#FFFF00>- Should I? I was so busy that I didn't even get to eat lunch. - Really?</font>

256
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:52,071
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - That's great. Let's get a bowl of rice soup then.</font>

257
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,227
<font color=#FFFF00>But rice soup is okay, isn't it?</font>

258
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,190
<font color=#FFFF00>- Of course it is. Let's go. - Okay.</font>

259
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:14,579
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

260
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,157
<font color=#FFFF00>Go in first. I'll be there soon.</font>

261
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:26,179
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sure. I'll order two bowls then. - Sure.</font>

262
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:30,891
<font color=#FFFF00>If you leave the dishes out here, I'll come pick them up later. Enjoy.</font>

263
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:46,422
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you follow me here for?</font>

264
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,157
<font color=#FFFF00>It seemed like you had moved away.</font>

265
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,063
<font color=#FFFF00>You changed your number, too.</font>

266
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,414
<font color=#FFFF00>What's your new number?</font>

267
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go.</font>

268
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,102
<font color=#FFFF00>We were once a married couple,</font>

269
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:06,947
<font color=#FFFF00>but now we're divorced.</font>

270
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:11,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it common courtesy to ignore each other even</font>

271
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,036
<font color=#FFFF00>if we coincidentally run into each other like this?</font>

272
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:19,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, how do you expect me to ignore you when I see you living like this?</font>

273
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:22,930
<font color=#FFFF00>How am I living?</font>

274
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:27,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what it seems like to you,</font>

275
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,766
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm living very well.</font>

276
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:35,055
<font color=#FFFF00>So you neither have to pity me nor sympathize with me.</font>

277
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:37,876
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

278
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:41,461
<font color=#FFFF00>I got it, so give me your new number.</font>

279
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Please just forget me.</font>

280
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,789
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all I want from you.</font>

281
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Also...</font>

282
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:56,610
<font color=#FFFF00>even if we coincidentally run into each other,</font>

283
00:19:57,852 --> 00:19:59,547
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you can just ignore me.</font>

284
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,126
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

285
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:18,383
<font color=#FFFF00>(Dongbaek Restaurant)</font>

286
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,594
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm back. - Good job.</font>

287
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:08,841
<font color=#FFFF00>It's that house.</font>

288
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:19,110
<font color=#FFFF00>This is where Mi-poong used to live?</font>

289
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:20,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

290
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,813
<font color=#FFFF00>Call Mr. Lee.</font>

291
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,243
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir.</font>

292
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,086
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, isn't that Mr. Lee?</font>

293
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:35,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

294
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:36,924
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

295
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,710
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

296
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:44,024
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to ask you something.</font>

297
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:46,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead.</font>

298
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:52,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you and Mi-poong got a divorce.</font>

299
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:56,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you get in contact with her?</font>

300
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:58,776
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she right now?</font>

301
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,461
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not keeping in touch.</font>

302
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,563
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know her number either.</font>

303
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:10,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there a way you can find her?</font>

304
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:13,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you searching for Mi-poong?</font>

305
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim would really like to find her.</font>

306
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:27,264
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is, I ran into Mi-poong by chance earlier.</font>

307
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,805
<font color=#FFFF00>You did?</font>

308
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you see her? Where is she right now?</font>

309
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,016
<font color=#FFFF00>It seemed like she was working at Dongbaek Restaurant in Yeongdeungpo.</font>

310
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,133
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true?</font>

311
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:41,231
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. May I ask you what this is all about?</font>

312
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:47,469
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a reason why I need to meet with her.</font>

313
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:52,341
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. Dal-ho, let's go. - Yes, sir.</font>

314
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:04,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is the chairman of Winner's Group looking for Mi-poong?</font>

315
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:10,516
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a fallen one.</font>

316
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,541
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm back.</font>

317
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:14,485
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jang-go is back. - Hi, Jang-go.</font>

318
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:15,657
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

319
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Mi-poong cause trouble at Winner's Group again?</font>

320
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,235
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she do something like embezzlement?</font>

321
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:24,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

322
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:30,750
<font color=#FFFF00>If not, why would the chairman look for her and not you?</font>

323
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,274
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like they're connected in any way.</font>

324
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to my room.</font>

325
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:42,397
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this about? Who's looking for Mi-poong?</font>

326
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,187
<font color=#FFFF00>The chairman of Winner's Group came to the front</font>

327
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,193
<font color=#FFFF00>of the house earlier to look for Mi-poong.</font>

328
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,022
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Are you serious?</font>

329
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,897
<font color=#FFFF00>My grandfather came in front of our house?</font>

330
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,451
<font color=#FFFF00>But why did he just leave without contacting me?</font>

331
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,164
<font color=#FFFF00>If he had come just to say hello, he would have called you, but</font>

332
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,374
<font color=#FFFF00>didn't he just leave because he had an important matter to attend to?</font>

333
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she really stir up trouble again?</font>

334
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:05,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Would the chairman really search for her himself?</font>

335
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:09,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Usually, in those cases, his subordinates would take care of it.</font>

336
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:11,226
<font color=#FFFF00>The chairman wouldn't get involved himself.</font>

337
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,903
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what this is all about, but what would</font>

338
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:16,007
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go have done if he hadn't gotten divorced?</font>

339
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:20,388
<font color=#FFFF00>The sparks would've flown at him again.</font>

340
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:23,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make her into a terrible person without knowing the full story.</font>

341
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:27,633
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong was afraid we would lose our house, so she</font>

342
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:31,281
<font color=#FFFF00>sold her diner and house to pay the bank back for us.</font>

343
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:37,327
<font color=#FFFF00>It's freezing outside, and they have a little one with them.</font>

344
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:41,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder where they are and how they're doing when they have nothing with them.</font>

345
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:44,718
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - I know.</font>

346
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,356
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo, do you really think Jang-go isn't contacting Mi-poong these days?</font>

347
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:57,031
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

348
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:08,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome.</font>

349
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,866
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me, but I have a question. - Sure.</font>

350
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:14,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Does a young lady named Kim Mi-poong work here?</font>

351
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong?</font>

352
00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:18,718
<font color=#FFFF00>We heard that she was working here.</font>

353
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:20,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that young lady?</font>

354
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:24,280
<font color=#FFFF00>She only came for today. She's gone now.</font>

355
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,937
<font color=#FFFF00>S-She's gone?</font>

356
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:30,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. What's the matter?</font>

357
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:35,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Then do you have her phone number?</font>

358
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,180
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't get her number, since she only worked here for a half a day.</font>

359
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,117
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim.</font>

360
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:49,890
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth happened, Dal-ho? Where are we supposed to find her?</font>

361
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:55,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, all we have to do is find her now, so don't worry.</font>

362
00:25:55,812 --> 00:26:03,327
<font color=#FFFF00>What if that wicked brat bullies my granddaughter in the meantime?</font>

363
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:14,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Dae-hoon. It's me.</font>

364
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you coming home?</font>

365
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:18,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm hungry.</font>

366
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,179
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're hungry, eat first.</font>

367
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:24,226
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something important to do.</font>

368
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:27,484
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm going to starve if you don't come home.</font>

369
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:31,186
<font color=#FFFF00>So hurry up and come home, father.</font>

370
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:33,499
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

371
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:42,546
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, eat a lot.</font>

372
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:45,640
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. Grandma and Aunt Mi-poong, you guys eat a lot, too.</font>

373
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:46,968
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

374
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:51,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, let's go eat dumpling soup tomorrow.</font>

375
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,179
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

376
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong,</font>

377
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:05,913
<font color=#FFFF00>after we're done eating, let's go meet Mr. Kim Bok-dong again.</font>

378
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:10,562
<font color=#FFFF00>We can ask him for the details about that young lady who came with Ms. Ma.</font>

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Something is a bit fishy here.</font>

380
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,562
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

381
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:26,429
<font color=#FFFF00>We're paying the interest on time, so why are you doing this?</font>

382
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:29,077
<font color=#FFFF00>This won't do. I feel anxious.</font>

383
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:32,369
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know when you'll run away again, and paying back</font>

384
00:27:32,394 --> 00:27:35,049
<font color=#FFFF00>your interest a little bit at a time isn't good enough.</font>

385
00:27:35,357 --> 00:27:36,639
<font color=#FFFF00>I need the principal amount.</font>

386
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:41,288
<font color=#FFFF00>How will we be able to pay the principal amount now? Please give us some time.</font>

387
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,501
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll definitely pay you back.</font>

388
00:27:44,015 --> 00:27:47,210
<font color=#FFFF00>And we don't have anywhere else to go, so we won't run away.</font>

389
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:52,124
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys will never be able to pay me back.</font>

390
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,890
<font color=#FFFF00>So I found a way for you guys to pay the principal</font>

391
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:58,719
<font color=#FFFF00>amount back, so hurry up and pack your bags.</font>

392
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,099
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean you found a way for us to pay</font>

393
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,176
<font color=#FFFF00>the principal amount? What are you doing?</font>

394
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:04,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Damn it!</font>

395
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:11,358
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have time to explain, so hurry up and pack your bags!</font>

396
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,569
<font color=#FFFF00>Baby, eat your ramen. It's okay.</font>

397
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:19,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Pack up!</font>

398
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:26,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you taking us right now?</font>

399
00:28:26,562 --> 00:28:29,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us where we're going.</font>

400
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Be quiet!</font>

401
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,640
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do if you know? Jump out of this moving van?</font>

402
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:39,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't give me a headache, and let's go quietly. Got it?</font>

403
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:44,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are we going? I'm scared.</font>

404
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:49,069
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, you have me and your aunt. Don't worry. It's okay.</font>

405
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,640
<font color=#FFFF00>(White House Night Club)</font>

406
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:09,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is this place?</font>

407
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:11,804
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't work at such a place.</font>

408
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:15,408
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean you can't? You need to pay my money back.</font>

409
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,325
<font color=#FFFF00>If you work here for six months, I'll take money off the</font>

410
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,507
<font color=#FFFF00>principal amount and interest, so stay here quiet as dead mice.</font>

411
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:25,831
<font color=#FFFF00>Then will we only be working in the kitchen?</font>

412
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:29,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. Do you guys know how to do anything else?</font>

413
00:29:30,257 --> 00:29:34,563
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you try to run away, I'll follow you to the ends of the</font>

414
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:38,826
<font color=#FFFF00>earth and let you feel my wrath, so don't get any funny ideas.</font>

415
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:39,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Got that?</font>

416
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Now go inside and work.</font>

417
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:46,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Then please write a contract.</font>

418
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
<font color=#FFFF00>What contract?</font>

419
00:29:47,897 --> 00:29:50,425
<font color=#FFFF00>A contract that promises you'll take money off the principal</font>

420
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,562
<font color=#FFFF00>amount and interest if we work here for six months.</font>

421
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:54,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh!</font>

422
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,687
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. I'll write it.</font>

423
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:58,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll write it. You happy now?</font>

424
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:01,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Then go inside! Go in!</font>

425
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:02,695
<font color=#FFFF00>Get the bags!</font>

426
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:05,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and go inside!</font>

427
00:30:08,382 --> 00:30:09,649
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and go in!</font>

428
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:18,976
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

429
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:24,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

430
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,492
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want?</font>

431
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,437
<font color=#FFFF00>I made dinner to celebrate grandfather's recovery and discharge from the hospital.</font>

432
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,892
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's okay, you should join us.</font>

433
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

434
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,507
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

435
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:48,054
<font color=#FFFF00>this is yours.</font>

436
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Open it.</font>

437
00:30:55,968 --> 00:31:01,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought of you while knitting this myself.</font>

438
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:07,366
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really think I'd wear that around my neck?</font>

439
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:10,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

440
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,874
<font color=#FFFF00>While I was knitting each stitch,</font>

441
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I prayed that we wouldn't divorce.</font>

442
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:24,395
<font color=#FFFF00>I prayed that you wouldn't leave.</font>

443
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,624
<font color=#FFFF00>I made it while praying for those wishes.</font>

444
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:32,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll join the dinner because of the other family members,</font>

445
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:37,006
<font color=#FFFF00>but you shouldn't expect anything else from me anymore.</font>

446
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,913
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine if you curse me for being a shameless woman.</font>

447
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:50,374
<font color=#FFFF00>But can't you give me one chance?</font>

448
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:53,992
<font color=#FFFF00>Just once...</font>

449
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:59,749
<font color=#FFFF00>You promised me you wouldn't leave me no matter what happens.</font>

450
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,819
<font color=#FFFF00>You promised to stay by my side no matter what happens.</font>

451
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:09,366
<font color=#FFFF00>My dad returned as a little child.</font>

452
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,288
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only one who I can rely on.</font>

453
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:20,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a terrible woman,</font>

454
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,851
<font color=#FFFF00>but still, can't you stay by my side?</font>

455
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:33,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, I'm sorry.</font>

456
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:50,991
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, thank you for coming back alive.</font>

457
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:53,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much.</font>

458
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:55,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

459
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:01,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, I'm very happy that I came back as well.</font>

460
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, I'll obey you from now on.</font>

461
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:12,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very sorry that I was being stubborn and didn't obey you at the hospital.</font>

462
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,788
<font color=#FFFF00>No, dad.</font>

463
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:20,280
<font color=#FFFF00>You were the one who had suffered the most while grandfather was in the hospital.</font>

464
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

465
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:23,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course!</font>

466
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,593
<font color=#FFFF00>You were the one who did your best by his side and suffered the most.</font>

467
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,960
<font color=#FFFF00>You were the best!</font>

468
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:38,632
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Then I'll sing a song to congratulate father's return.</font>

469
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:43,851
<font color=#FFFF00>- A song? Why a song out of the blue? - Yoo-Jin!</font>

470
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,937
<font color=#FFFF00>A song!</font>

471
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:48,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Start!</font>

472
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:24,294
<font color=#FFFF00>That shameless wench is taking charge of someone else's place.</font>

473
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:30,489
<font color=#FFFF00>She definitely knows where Mi-poong and Yoo-sung are.</font>

474
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:36,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, I'll make sure to find your wife, your</font>

475
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,919
<font color=#FFFF00>daughter Mi-poong, and your grandson Yoo-sung for you.</font>

476
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise.</font>

477
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:48,669
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Cha. - Yes, sir.</font>

478
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:53,747
<font color=#FFFF00>Quickly cancel the registration of Park Shin-ae in my family registry.</font>

479
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:59,192
<font color=#FFFF00>- Cancel? - Yes, and make sure you keep this fact a secret.</font>

480
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:06,505
<font color=#FFFF00>If Park Shin-ae or Ma Chung-ja calls you, just say it's still being progressed.</font>

481
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:09,395
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you understand? - Yes, sir.</font>

482
00:36:19,615 --> 00:36:23,381
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you investigated Park Shin-ae's slush fund?</font>

483
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:26,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir. Everything will be found out by today.</font>

484
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,028
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? - Yes, sir.</font>

485
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:34,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Good work. Make sure you find out about everything.</font>

486
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:37,794
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't miss a single penny.</font>

487
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,770
<font color=#FFFF00>And make sure you find a way to collect that back as well.</font>

488
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,434
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry, Mr. Kim.</font>

489
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:55,364
<font color=#FFFF00>Park Shin-ae, I'm going to chase you out with nothing.</font>

490
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:06,661
<font color=#FFFF00>These are the documents Ms. Park Shin-ae have</font>

491
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:09,076
<font color=#FFFF00>authorized as the acting president while you were away.</font>

492
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:26,270
<font color=#FFFF00>(Dismissal Notice)</font>

493
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:31,645
<font color=#FFFF00>The dismissal of Lawyer Lee Jang-go?</font>

494
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,591
<font color=#FFFF00>This wicked wench.</font>

495
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Look here.</font>

496
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:50,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this.</font>

497
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:57,833
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my! Oh my goodness!</font>

498
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:08,896
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

499
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, what kind of dream is this?</font>

500
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,692
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it a dream that brings money?</font>

501
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:21,997
<font color=#FFFF00>That's amazing.</font>

502
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:23,872
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of dream was that?</font>

503
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:24,897
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

504
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,424
<font color=#FFFF00>I must be having spring fever lately.</font>

505
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:34,506
<font color=#FFFF00>I was taking a nap when I had a dream where</font>

506
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:39,702
<font color=#FFFF00>an enormous, golden pumpkin came into my lap.</font>

507
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:40,976
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? - Yes.</font>

508
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:48,237
<font color=#FFFF00>But that pumpkin was so bright that I thought I was going blind.</font>

509
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I was so thrilled, but I woke up.</font>

510
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:56,635
<font color=#FFFF00>What does it mean?</font>

511
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:01,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, something good must be happening in our family!</font>

512
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess so.</font>

513
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:07,237
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems like a conception dream, too.</font>

514
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:09,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, are you going somewhere?</font>

515
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:12,315
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, to my colleague's office to help with his work.</font>

516
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,533
<font color=#FFFF00>Your colleague's office?</font>

517
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,956
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, this is Lawyer Lee Jang-go.</font>

518
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:23,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon? The chairman?</font>

519
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,557
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Thank you.</font>

520
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:30,667
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that about?</font>

521
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:34,651
<font color=#FFFF00>The chairman of Winner's Group is looking for you?</font>

522
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:37,706
<font color=#FFFF00>He gave me my job back.</font>

523
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:42,612
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my gosh! Are you serious?  - My goodness! How grateful!</font>

524
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:46,221
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants me to come see him, so I'll tell you the details later.</font>

525
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:49,018
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sure! Go ahead! - Sure!</font>

526
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:57,456
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, that pumpkin dream must have been about Jang-go getting his job back!</font>

527
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,674
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're right! - Mother!</font>

528
00:40:00,323 --> 00:40:01,737
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness!</font>

529
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,870
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong with you? Do you feel unwell? - Yes, mother.</font>

530
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:13,439
<font color=#FFFF00>The coffee tastes like tonic, and I feel nauseated as well.</font>

531
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:21,221
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this? The pumpkin dream is a conception dream?</font>

532
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,317
<font color=#FFFF00>A conception dream?</font>

533
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:28,553
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you reinstated me to my position.</font>

534
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,769
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know the reason why Ms. Park Shin-ae dismissed me?</font>

535
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:36,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I know everything.</font>

536
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll speak comfortably.</font>

537
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:44,173
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I come back, I'm going to investigate Kim</font>

538
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:46,636
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong's incident of the leaked design until the end.</font>

539
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:52,609
<font color=#FFFF00>If you won't allow me to do that, I won't return.</font>

540
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,933
<font color=#FFFF00>That won't happen. I promise you.</font>

541
00:40:57,378 --> 00:41:00,581
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason why I reinstated you to your position is because</font>

542
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you to thoroughly investigate that incident.</font>

543
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir. I understand.</font>

544
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:15,292
<font color=#FFFF00>There must be someone else behind this.</font>

545
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:18,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you get that evidence.</font>

546
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:20,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'll make sure to reveal the truth.</font>

547
00:41:21,331 --> 00:41:23,386
<font color=#FFFF00>Good. Please do.</font>

548
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:28,638
<font color=#FFFF00>And when you get in touch with Mi-poong, let me know right away.</font>

549
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,154
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir.</font>

550
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you keep an eye on Park Shin-ae and follow her.</font>

551
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,528
<font color=#FFFF00>She definitely knows where Mi-poong is.</font>

552
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Tail her quietly. Bye.</font>

553
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,025
<font color=#FFFF00>You, over there.</font>

554
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:11,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. What is it?</font>

555
00:42:12,522 --> 00:42:13,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Not you, your daughter.</font>

556
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:15,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Me?</font>

557
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, you. Come over here.</font>

558
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:19,483
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

559
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:21,593
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want Mi-poong for?</font>

560
00:42:22,294 --> 00:42:25,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- If you need to talk to her, talk to her here. - I won't eat her.</font>

561
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:26,796
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop worrying.</font>

562
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:28,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out here. It's okay. Come here.</font>

563
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:39,381
<font color=#FFFF00>There are many customers today, and we're very busy, so go out there and serve.</font>

564
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:40,406
<font color=#FFFF00>Serving?</font>

565
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:45,905
<font color=#FFFF00>No, sir! Didn't we come here to work in the kitchen?</font>

566
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,584
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong has never done such a thing before, so she can't do it.</font>

567
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:52,006
<font color=#FFFF00>No one does it right the first time. Everyone learns it first!</font>

568
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:55,116
<font color=#FFFF00>And during busy times, you do different kinds of jobs.</font>

569
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,061
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

570
00:42:58,444 --> 00:42:59,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir!</font>

571
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:01,530
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine. It's fine.</font>

572
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:04,155
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a lot easier than kitchen work.</font>

573
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir!</font>

574
00:43:06,248 --> 00:43:08,756
<font color=#FFFF00>You get tips, too. You don't know anything.</font>

575
00:43:19,624 --> 00:43:22,519
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen her before. She's fresh. Just my style.</font>

576
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:24,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit here next to me.</font>

577
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:27,358
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I doing? Excuse me.</font>

578
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:30,124
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a good time.</font>

579
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:34,565
<font color=#FFFF00>You just came. Where are you going?</font>

580
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:36,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you a student?</font>

581
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:39,175
<font color=#FFFF00>How old are you?</font>

582
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:41,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you pretending to be innocent?</font>

583
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:45,866
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't be like that and pour me a drink.  - I don't know how to do these things.</font>

584
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:46,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be going now.</font>

585
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:50,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Just pour me a drink.</font>

586
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:52,069
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me!</font>

587
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:55,577
<font color=#FFFF00>Damn it!</font>

588
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:58,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Who do you think you are, you bitch?</font>

589
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:01,073
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who do you think you are, you bitch? - Hey!</font>

590
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:07,719
<font color=#FFFF00>You trashy bastard! Do you not have a younger sister?</font>

591
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:14,022
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go! - Hey, manager!</font>

592
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:17,270
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of here! - What the hell?</font>

593
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:18,961
<font color=#FFFF00>We're sorry. We're sorry.</font>

594
00:44:21,507 --> 00:44:22,507
<font color=#FFFF00>Go inside!</font>

595
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:27,764
<font color=#FFFF00>You're making me lose my mind here.</font>

596
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:31,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't you do it like the other girls?</font>

597
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:34,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Will your wrist break if you pour him a drink?</font>

598
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,233
<font color=#FFFF00>I should just-!</font>

599
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:39,194
<font color=#FFFF00>We're only supposed to work in the kitchen!</font>

600
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:41,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Doing kitchen work and serving out there is the</font>

601
00:44:41,518 --> 00:44:43,343
<font color=#FFFF00>same damn thing! Why are you arguing with me?</font>

602
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:45,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

603
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,876
<font color=#FFFF00>If you cause trouble among the customers again, I won't let you get away with it.</font>

604
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Got that?</font>

605
00:44:52,811 --> 00:44:56,694
<font color=#FFFF00>Damn it.</font>

606
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:06,319
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yoo-sung, it's okay. - It's okay.</font>

607
00:45:09,397 --> 00:45:14,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, I think we came to the wrong place.</font>

608
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:19,790
<font color=#FFFF00>They made you do something like that. I can never watch you do that.</font>

609
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:21,795
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom...</font>

610
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:23,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong...</font>

611
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:25,889
<font color=#FFFF00>let's...</font>

612
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:30,561
<font color=#FFFF00>run away from here.</font>

613
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:32,671
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

614
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's run away and hide.</font>

615
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,303
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go live somewhere where they can't find us.</font>

616
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, hurry up. Come out.</font>

617
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:16,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Those wenches! Get them!</font>

618
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:25,381
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me! - Mom!</font>

619
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom! - You bitch!</font>

620
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

621
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:43,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, we're really sorry! We won't ever do it again!</font>

622
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,296
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please spare her! - Get up!</font>

623
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:52,607
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir, we're sorry! Please spare her life! No! - Get up!</font>

624
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:54,006
<font color=#FFFF00>No! Please don't!</font>

625
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:57,116
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

626
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,679
<font color=#FFFF00>We're sorry!</font>

627
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:01,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

628
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,592
<font color=#FFFF00>We're sorry!</font>

629
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,183
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you?</font>

630
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:09,381
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I would get you if you tried to run away.</font>

631
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:11,569
<font color=#FFFF00>I dare you to try running away again.</font>

632
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:13,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll sell you off to an island!</font>

633
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:15,421
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it?</font>

634
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:17,178
<font color=#FFFF00>You little-!</font>

635
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,458
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, drag them inside!</font>

636
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:24,311
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom! - Get up!</font>

637
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:28,843
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

638
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:31,741
<font color=#FFFF00>They got caught trying to run away?</font>

639
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:35,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch them carefully.</font>

640
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,639
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure they can't run away.</font>

641
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:40,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure they can't come near Seoul.</font>

642
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,558
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

643
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,483
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm bored.</font>

644
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:03,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I call up my friends for lunch?</font>

645
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:10,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, it's Geum-sil.</font>

646
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,014
<font color=#FFFF00>What is she doing here?</font>

647
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:20,161
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Ma, give me some juice.</font>

648
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:23,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Go the kitchen and tell the housekeeper to get you some. My friend is here.</font>

649
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no! I must be out of my mind!</font>

650
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:34,873
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am! Oh! What are you doing? Why are you grabbing my arm?</font>

651
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:38,905
<font color=#FFFF00>My friend is coming, and she'll be here soon. Stay in your room.</font>

652
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,121
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I need to stay in my room if your friend is here?</font>

653
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:48,967
<font color=#FFFF00>My friend gets shocked when she sees men, so go to your room!</font>

654
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:51,334
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to drink juice!</font>

655
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,350
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll tell the housekeeper, so go in! - Chung-ja, I'm here!</font>

656
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,139
<font color=#FFFF00>All right! Don't push me!</font>

657
00:48:57,452 --> 00:49:01,662
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, hi, Geum-sil! Go to my bedroom! - What are you doing over there?</font>

658
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:04,787
<font color=#FFFF00>- Well... - Give me juice!</font>

659
00:49:06,874 --> 00:49:11,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Bring some juice to Mr. Kim's room!</font>

660
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,756
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Geum-sil, go inside!</font>

661
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,907
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me some juice!</font>

662
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:19,569
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit down.</font>

663
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:22,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness! What's the matter with you?</font>

664
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:24,679
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

665
00:49:25,335 --> 00:49:27,194
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just so tired of that man.</font>

666
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he Mr. Kim's son?</font>

667
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:32,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see his face?</font>

668
00:49:32,765 --> 00:49:36,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Not exactly because you were pushing him into the room.</font>

669
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:38,959
<font color=#FFFF00>But he's younger and more normal than I thought he was.</font>

670
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:40,483
<font color=#FFFF00>Normal, my foot.</font>

671
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,678
<font color=#FFFF00>He has the body of an old man and the mind of a little kid.</font>

672
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:47,702
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be stressed out.</font>

673
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:49,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even get me started.</font>

674
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,663
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you to my house? And what are these?</font>

675
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:59,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Chung-ja, thank you for giving my son his job back.</font>

676
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:02,061
<font color=#FFFF00>These are bracken from Jeju-do and traditional honey.</font>

677
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Giving him his job back?</font>

678
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:05,483
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

679
00:50:05,983 --> 00:50:08,342
<font color=#FFFF00>My son is working for Winner's Group again.</font>

680
00:50:09,015 --> 00:50:11,647
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it happened because you had talked to Mr. Kim about it.</font>

681
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:13,686
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I didn't know about this.</font>

682
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:16,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. How did he get his job back?</font>

683
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:18,116
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

684
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:22,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim had come to the front of our house a few days ago.</font>

685
00:50:22,827 --> 00:50:25,795
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim went to your house?</font>

686
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:27,194
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

687
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:30,552
<font color=#FFFF00>But back then, he had been searching for Mi-poong</font>

688
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:33,108
<font color=#FFFF00>and had asked my son for her phone number.</font>

689
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:37,295
<font color=#FFFF00>So I assumed Mi-poong had caused trouble again.</font>

690
00:50:37,882 --> 00:50:41,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim asked for Mi-poong's phone number?</font>

691
00:50:41,858 --> 00:50:43,858
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Why are you so surprised?</font>

692
00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:46,825
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm not.</font>

693
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just a bit confused that he went to your house.</font>

694
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:58,139
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, I was so grateful that he gave Jang-go his job back.</font>

695
00:50:59,585 --> 00:51:04,709
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum-sil, I was in the middle of getting ready to go out.</font>

696
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:07,996
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Then go ahead and get ready. Let's leave together.</font>

697
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon? Grandfather is searching for Mi-poong?</font>

698
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:19,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. A few days ago, he went to Lee Jang-go and asked for Mi-poong's phone number.</font>

699
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:23,905
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he's searching for Mi-poong because he found out you were an imposter?</font>

700
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:26,241
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

701
00:51:27,022 --> 00:51:30,077
<font color=#FFFF00>If that was true, with his temper, would he have just let me be?</font>

702
00:51:30,819 --> 00:51:31,819
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true.</font>

703
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:39,491
<font color=#FFFF00>But Shin-ae, lately I've been having nightmares, and I'm so nervous that I can't live.</font>

704
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,987
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead of keeping Mi-poong in the countryside, can't you send her somewhere</font>

705
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:48,703
<font color=#FFFF00>far away to a different country where we won't be able to see her?</font>

706
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would grandfather be searching for Mi-poong?</font>

707
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:55,639
<font color=#FFFF00>I know!</font>

708
00:51:56,983 --> 00:52:00,717
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so strange. I have a bad feeling about this.</font>

709
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:37,934
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. I'm calling you to report that Ms. Park Shin-ae</font>

710
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:40,108
<font color=#FFFF00>is leaving Seoul and heading over to the countryside.</font>

711
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:41,991
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she headed?</font>

712
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:44,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's Dongducheon.</font>

713
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:46,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Dongducheon?</font>

714
00:52:56,452 --> 00:52:59,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo! Mi-poong!</font>

715
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, what's this? Why-</font>

716
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:11,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, your face...</font>

717
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae.</font>

718
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,040
<font color=#FFFF00>If you were having such a hard time that you had to</font>

719
00:53:22,584 --> 00:53:24,725
<font color=#FFFF00>get a private loan, you should've just come to me.</font>

720
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:26,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I would've helped you.</font>

721
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:34,615
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't even know how we ended up like this.</font>

722
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:41,889
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't even know you were here. I was searching everywhere for you.</font>

723
00:53:44,335 --> 00:53:45,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

724
00:53:46,444 --> 00:53:47,639
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen?</font>

725
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I found Mi-poong's father.</font>

726
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:54,691
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you serious?</font>

727
00:53:55,413 --> 00:53:56,746
<font color=#FFFF00>You found my father?</font>

728
00:53:57,257 --> 00:53:59,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is he right now?</font>

729
00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:03,116
<font color=#FFFF00>Until a few days ago, he was here in Korea, but</font>

730
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:05,233
<font color=#FFFF00>he left to China to search for his family.</font>

731
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,735
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of the gun wound he received while</font>

732
00:54:09,155 --> 00:54:11,397
<font color=#FFFF00>escaping North Korea, his memories aren't stable.</font>

733
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:15,803
<font color=#FFFF00>An acquaintance of mine met him in China, so hurry up and go meet him.</font>

734
00:54:16,772 --> 00:54:18,694
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true?</font>

735
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:20,554
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

736
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:26,553
<font color=#FFFF00>But what do we do?</font>

737
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:28,780
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not in the best situation.</font>

738
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:33,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, can you help us?</font>

739
00:54:36,897 --> 00:54:39,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, listen to me quietly.</font>

740
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:43,061
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll look for a stowaway ship.</font>

741
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:45,559
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't be able to get on the plane because of</font>

742
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:48,092
<font color=#FFFF00>the loan sharps, so you'll have to ride a ship.</font>

743
00:54:48,193 --> 00:54:51,734
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do whatever I can to help you escape and</font>

744
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:54,914
<font color=#FFFF00>go to China, so please wait a little bit.</font>

745
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:00,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Thank you, Shin-ae. Thank you so much.</font>

746
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:03,053
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a problem.</font>

747
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,991
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to repay you for your kindness.</font>

748
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:16,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, please wait a few more days.</font>

749
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,733
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

750
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:40,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't he contacting us?</font>

751
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:49,452
<font color=#FFFF00>But why did Shin-ae go to a nightclub?</font>

752
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's there?</font>

753
00:55:52,077 --> 00:55:54,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim is tailing Shin-ae, so he'll call us soon.</font>

754
00:55:57,499 --> 00:56:01,334
<font color=#FFFF00>They might be there.They're there.</font>

755
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. What if Mi-poong is over there, like Dae-hoon once was?</font>

756
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:08,959
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go there first. - Yes, sir.</font>

757
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,536
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Kim. - What is it?</font>

758
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:18,756
<font color=#FFFF00>This is...</font>

759
00:56:22,991 --> 00:56:25,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong was here!</font>

760
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:28,936
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go there right away. - Yes, sir.</font>

761
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:35,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Get the car ready. We're leaving right now. Tell the guards to come as well.</font>

762
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:38,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom...</font>

763
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:40,269
<font color=#FFFF00>about Shin-ae...</font>

764
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:44,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she suddenly offering to help us meet father?</font>

765
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:49,702
<font color=#FFFF00>When we asked her for help to find him, she rejected us.</font>

766
00:56:50,483 --> 00:56:53,757
<font color=#FFFF00>First, she told us to go to America, and now she's telling us to go to China.</font>

767
00:56:54,608 --> 00:56:57,358
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't feel right about this.</font>

768
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:03,983
<font color=#FFFF00>And how did she know we were here?</font>

769
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:06,825
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't have cell-phones, and we were dragged</font>

770
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,483
<font color=#FFFF00>here out of the blue by the loan sharks.</font>

771
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I think there's something strange going on.</font>

772
00:57:12,546 --> 00:57:14,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I think that lady is strange, too.</font>

773
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:18,927
<font color=#FFFF00>When I went to Yoo-jin's house, she came looking for me at</font>

774
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:22,950
<font color=#FFFF00>home and told me I would go to jail for stealing that ring.</font>

775
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:26,811
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't steal it though. Yoo-Jin gave it to me.</font>

776
00:57:29,788 --> 00:57:32,756
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, what are you talking about?</font>

777
00:57:33,436 --> 00:57:36,903
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that's right. I'm not supposed to tell you this.</font>

778
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:39,108
<font color=#FFFF00>They told me not to tell you this.</font>

779
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:45,435
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, tell us. You can tell us.</font>

780
00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:51,662
<font color=#FFFF00>There was the same exact ring that grandma wears on her finger in Mr. Kim's room.</font>

781
00:57:52,046 --> 00:57:55,381
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why Yoo-Jin gave it to me, so that we can play house.</font>

782
00:57:56,249 --> 00:57:58,492
<font color=#FFFF00>Then? Then what happened to that ring?</font>

783
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:00,147
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost it.</font>

784
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You lost it?</font>

785
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:07,022
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I put the ring in the pocket of my pants...</font>

786
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Or maybe not...</font>

787
00:58:09,561 --> 00:58:10,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, I lost it.</font>

788
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:16,491
<font color=#FFFF00>But that lady and the scary older lady came to our house and said that if I</font>

789
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,631
<font color=#FFFF00>ever tell grandma and aunt about this, the police would take me to jail.</font>

790
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:24,116
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, are you telling the truth?</font>

791
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:25,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

792
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:33,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, was the same ring as mine really in Mr. Kim's room?</font>

793
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:34,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

794
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:40,326
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

795
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:44,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it Shin-ae that made you faint in the</font>

796
00:58:44,192 --> 00:58:46,781
<font color=#FFFF00>park last time and stole the ring from you?</font>

797
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:52,916
<font color=#FFFF00>Those rings are between grandmother and grandfather, so how could the same ring exist?</font>

798
00:58:53,952 --> 00:58:54,952
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

799
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:57,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought that was strange as well.</font>

800
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:01,842
<font color=#FFFF00>My ring was definitely on my finger that day.</font>

801
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:08,353
<font color=#FFFF00>It was so strange how I had lost it at the park,</font>

802
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,843
<font color=#FFFF00>but it had somehow appeared under the closet.</font>

803
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,530
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Shin-ae is the one behind this.</font>

804
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:18,624
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would she?</font>

805
00:59:25,702 --> 00:59:26,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Is...</font>

806
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim your grandfather?</font>

807
00:59:41,319 --> 00:59:42,319
<font color=#FFFF00>"Cheon!"</font>

808
00:59:43,381 --> 00:59:47,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim's name is Kim Deok-cheon!</font>

809
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:54,109
<font color=#FFFF00>I think the young lady who came out with the older</font>

810
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:57,233
<font color=#FFFF00>woman who the old man talked about is Shin-ae.</font>

811
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:04,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, even if we go to China, let's check the ring with Mr. Kim first.</font>

812
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:07,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, let's do that.</font>

813
01:00:08,616 --> 01:00:11,037
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Let's definitely check it out, Mi-poong.</font>

814
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:00,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

815
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:15,896
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, where are you?</font>

816
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:20,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, in front of the school?</font>

817
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:27,889
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Yoo-jin's birthday today. How about we go eat her favorite pasta together?</font>

818
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:33,702
<font color=#FFFF00>With my dad, too?</font>

819
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,936
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll leave at once with my dad.</font>

820
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

821
01:02:10,702 --> 01:02:11,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, how do I look?</font>

822
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:13,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I pretty?</font>

823
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:16,663
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

824
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:22,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, dad. You look really handsome today, too.</font>

825
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:23,792
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? - Yes.</font>

826
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:27,014
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you mean it? - Yes, I do.</font>

827
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad,</font>

828
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:34,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about before.</font>

829
01:02:34,913 --> 01:02:39,022
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be really good to you from now on. I won't get mad either.</font>

830
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:41,147
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean it?</font>

831
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:43,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

832
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:51,132
<font color=#FFFF00>All right then. From now on, let's not fight and get along, okay?</font>

833
01:02:51,788 --> 01:02:52,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Promise.</font>

834
01:02:53,218 --> 01:02:54,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Promise.</font>

835
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:59,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, let's hurry up and go. Hee-dong and Yoo-Jin are already there.</font>

836
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, let's go.</font>

837
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:16,537
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom! Grandpa! Over here!</font>

838
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:19,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-Jin! Hee-dong!</font>

839
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:32,498
<font color=#FFFF00>(White House Night Club)</font>

840
01:03:38,202 --> 01:03:40,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss, the women who live in the storage room are gone!</font>

841
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:44,194
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, wake up!</font>

842
01:03:48,968 --> 01:03:51,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey! - Run!</font>

843
01:03:53,092 --> 01:03:56,014
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yoo-sung. - Hurry up and run after them!</font>

844
01:03:58,061 --> 01:03:59,866
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung.</font>

845
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:03,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop right there!</font>

846
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop right there!</font>

847
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:11,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

848
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:16,246
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, drag them away. - No!</font>

849
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:21,287
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to go to Seoul and check something important! Please let us go!</font>

850
01:04:21,312 --> 01:04:24,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister, we'll make sure to pay you back. Please let us go just this once!</font>

851
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>- We need to find my father and grandfather! Please! - Enough with the nonsense!</font>

852
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:30,448
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mister!  - Come here!</font>

853
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:32,412
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mister! - Hurry up!</font>

854
01:04:32,437 --> 01:04:36,366
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help us out just this once!</font>

855
01:04:43,593 --> 01:04:44,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.</font>

856
01:05:00,185 --> 01:05:02,116
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me! Damn it! - Hold still!</font>

857
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go!</font>

858
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:25,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong!</font>

859
01:05:26,983 --> 01:05:27,983
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather?</font>

860
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong!</font>

861
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,673
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you my grandfather?</font>

862
01:05:40,429 --> 01:05:41,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather...</font>
