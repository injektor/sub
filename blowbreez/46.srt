3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:12,173
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep treating
me like I'm a little kid?</font>

4
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,794
<font color=#FFFF00>Just stay put!</font>

5
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:17,006
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you giving me a hard time?</font>

6
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:20,543
<font color=#FFFF00>Please just stay stuck at home!</font>

7
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:24,888
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how much I think of
it, you're not my daughter.</font>

8
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to say that.</font>

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:32,345
<font color=#FFFF00>If you keep doing that, I'm going to
lock you up in a mental institution.</font>

10
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:36,109
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to throw you away
where no one can find you!</font>

11
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,330
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

12
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,315
<font color=#FFFF00>did I just hear?</font>

13
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:53,322
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

15
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Lock him up in a mental institution?</font>

16
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:05,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Throw him away where no one can find him?</font>

17
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:10,863
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you just say those things
to your father right now?</font>

18
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:13,875
<font color=#FFFF00>T-That's because...</font>

19
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:21,095
<font color=#FFFF00>he wasn't listening to me and
kept insisting he would go out.</font>

20
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:26,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have said those things because
I was so upset. I'm sorry, grandfather.</font>

21
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:29,407
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you say such cruel things to your</font>

22
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,320
<font color=#FFFF00>father who helped bring you into this world?</font>

23
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,736
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how mentally insufficient he is...</font>

24
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:43,150
<font color=#FFFF00>how could you say those things to him when,
you're not a stranger, but his child?</font>

25
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:50,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you not feel pity for
your father who returned from death?</font>

26
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:53,933
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, grandfather.</font>

27
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,103
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.</font>

28
00:01:58,046 --> 00:01:59,360
<font color=#FFFF00>If you...</font>

29
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,446
<font color=#FFFF00>act cruelly to your father...</font>

30
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:06,672
<font color=#FFFF00>one more time...</font>

31
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,083
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to forgive you,
even if you're my granddaughter.</font>

32
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:12,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

33
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, grandfather.</font>

34
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Go.</font>

35
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

36
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

37
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, yes. It's okay now. You're okay now.</font>

38
00:02:57,546 --> 00:03:03,296
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't hear that I was
an imposter, did he?</font>

39
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:08,309
<font color=#FFFF00>If he had, he wouldn't have
just ended it with this.</font>

40
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:17,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon,</font>

41
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:24,436
<font color=#FFFF00>it is completely Shin-ae's fault
for mistreating you like this,</font>

42
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,940
<font color=#FFFF00>but you also need to make an effort
so that she can't do that to you.</font>

43
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:34,171
<font color=#FFFF00>You're Shin-ae's father.</font>

44
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:39,546
<font color=#FFFF00>As a father, you must keep your dignity.</font>

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,701
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pester her like a little child.</font>

46
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,679
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't hold onto
her hand, so you got lost.</font>

47
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,251
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why she's getting angry at you.</font>

48
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:53,513
<font color=#FFFF00>No, father. I don't want
to hold hands with her.</font>

49
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon.</font>

50
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:59,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

51
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:05,882
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Ms. Joo and Ms. Chun
said that Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

52
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:07,445
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

53
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,772
<font color=#FFFF00>An imposter?</font>

54
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:12,943
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said such a thing?</font>

55
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:20,715
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae said I shouldn't tell you this.</font>

56
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,827
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine, so tell me.</font>

57
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,646
<font color=#FFFF00>So the truth is, father...</font>

58
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:32,821
<font color=#FFFF00>the old woman who lived here before
said that Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

59
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:38,176
<font color=#FFFF00>But they said she had misspoken
because she had dementia...</font>

60
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,537
<font color=#FFFF00>But I still think Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

61
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,813
<font color=#FFFF00>What does all of this mean?</font>

62
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:55,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Chung-ja, are you in here?</font>

63
00:04:58,552 --> 00:04:59,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yes, Mr. Kim.</font>

64
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:06,856
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

65
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Did your mother have dementia</font>

66
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,191
<font color=#FFFF00>while she was staying at our house?</font>

67
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:17,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

68
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:19,247
<font color=#FFFF00>No, she didn't.</font>

69
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:26,196
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that you and your mother
had said Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

70
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:28,265
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that all about?</font>

71
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:34,481
<font color=#FFFF00>According to Dae-hoon, your mother
had said such a thing.</font>

72
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:36,591
<font color=#FFFF00>Imposter?</font>

73
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what you're talking about.</font>

74
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,708
<font color=#FFFF00>You mean she has never said that before?</font>

75
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:50,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she, perhaps, go
around saying that Shin-ae</font>

76
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,958
<font color=#FFFF00>isn't my granddaughter
because she disliked her?</font>

77
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:56,036
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that!</font>

78
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:03,281
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is, my mom was
showing signs of dementia.</font>

79
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:07,317
<font color=#FFFF00>I hid the fact from you because
I felt awkward telling you about it.</font>

80
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:11,176
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why she went to the countryside.</font>

81
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:17,120
<font color=#FFFF00>He must have heard my mom
saying strange things.</font>

82
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:18,817
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

83
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:25,739
<font color=#FFFF00>are you saying she called Shin-ae an
imposter because she has dementia?</font>

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,611
<font color=#FFFF00>I think so.</font>

85
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,864
<font color=#FFFF00>Or else, how would she say
such a thing in her sane mind?</font>

86
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:34,036
<font color=#FFFF00>That wouldn't make any sense.</font>

87
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:41,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You got the results that Shin-ae is really
your granddaughter through the DNA test.</font>

88
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,099
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

89
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:58,283
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh. I don't think I'll be able
to live long because of that idiot!</font>

90
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,692
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey! Young-ae! Honey!</font>

91
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, where are you?</font>

92
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:51,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you appear in front
of me one more time?</font>

93
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:57,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll never lose you again.</font>

94
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,606
<font color=#FFFF00>(Home Shopping Consignment Contract)</font>

95
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,895
<font color=#FFFF00>You made the right decision.</font>

96
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:20,366
<font color=#FFFF00>All you have to do now is sign the contract.</font>

97
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,161
<font color=#FFFF00>All the details we had requested
for are clearly written in here.</font>

98
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, sign here.</font>

99
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:34,542
<font color=#FFFF00>The first impressions are important, and
I have a great feeling about this one.</font>

100
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:37,645
<font color=#FFFF00>There will be good results.</font>

101
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:39,567
<font color=#FFFF00>(Kim Mi-poong)</font>

102
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

103
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,122
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

104
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:45,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take good care of us.</font>

105
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:49,036
<font color=#FFFF00>- We should be the ones saying that.
- Please take good care of us.</font>

106
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:55,909
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you that happy, mother?</font>

107
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:59,473
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm more fascinated than happy.</font>

108
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:02,681
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems like yesterday
we had been running away</font>

109
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:05,069
<font color=#FFFF00>from being caught doing
business by the subway.</font>

110
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:09,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, this feels like a dream to me, too.</font>

111
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Now we'll appear on home
shopping, find father,</font>

112
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:13,989
<font color=#FFFF00>and hit jackpot on our dumpling business.</font>

113
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Just thinking about it
makes me very, very happy.</font>

114
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:22,935
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, thank you so much.
This is all thanks to you.</font>

115
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,184
<font color=#FFFF00>No way, mother.</font>

116
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:29,686
<font color=#FFFF00>How is this thanks to me? This happened
because of your delicious dumplings.</font>

117
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:33,905
<font color=#FFFF00>No. We were able to come this far
because you stayed by our side.</font>

118
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,249
<font color=#FFFF00>You became a cane by our side.</font>

119
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:39,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. Thank you so much.</font>

120
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:45,575
<font color=#FFFF00>So Jang-go, I was thinking...</font>

121
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:53,133
<font color=#FFFF00>we could have dinner here
with your family tonight.</font>

122
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,669
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, that's a great idea!</font>

123
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:57,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Right?
- Should we?</font>

124
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,201
<font color=#FFFF00>- Should I give them a call?
- Yes, go ahead!</font>

125
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,015
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, grandma. Hold on. You can
talk to my mother-in-law.</font>

126
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, hello, ma'am!</font>

127
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:16,606
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello!</font>

128
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

129
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that's great!</font>

130
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations!</font>

131
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pray for your success.</font>

132
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,095
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, ma'am.</font>

133
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,599
<font color=#FFFF00>I was calling you because I wanted
to ask if you and your family would</font>

134
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,613
<font color=#FFFF00>like to come over to my
diner for dinner tonight.</font>

135
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:43,132
<font color=#FFFF00>You're inviting us to celebrate something
good, so of course we'll come.</font>

136
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,673
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll bring my entire family over tonight.</font>

137
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:50,262
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. See you later. Bye.</font>

138
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,332
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you so happy about?</font>

139
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:55,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you invited somewhere for dinner?</font>

140
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,762
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, well, the thing is...</font>

141
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:02,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Something great has happened,
so you can congratulate them...</font>

142
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:07,652
<font color=#FFFF00>and use this opportunity to get rid of
your pent-up antagonism towards them.</font>

143
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,317
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go together. Okay?</font>

144
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:11,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Antagonism?</font>

145
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,504
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, are you...?</font>

146
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, yes.</font>

147
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:21,061
<font color=#FFFF00>To celebrate their home
shopping contract, Mi-poong's</font>

148
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>family has invited our
family over for dinner.</font>

149
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:27,930
<font color=#FFFF00>That woman is so strange.</font>

150
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:31,461
<font color=#FFFF00>She invited us for dinner?</font>

151
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,554
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she insane?</font>

152
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,794
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Why would you speak so rudely?</font>

153
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Aside from everything else, they
worked so hard all this time.</font>

154
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:44,301
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with eating dinner with them to</font>

155
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,965
<font color=#FFFF00>celebrate something good
that has happened to them?</font>

156
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,309
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, don't go there.</font>

157
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,294
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

158
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:55,883
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine if you don't go, but
why tell me not to go either?</font>

159
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you ordering your mother-in-law around?</font>

160
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:04,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you go there, mother?</font>

161
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,779
<font color=#FFFF00>What do we have to do with them?</font>

162
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,465
<font color=#FFFF00>We're strangers now.</font>

163
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,948
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not strangers yet.</font>

164
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,121
<font color=#FFFF00>I beg your pardon?</font>

165
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:16,364
<font color=#FFFF00>They're still in their consideration period.</font>

166
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,179
<font color=#FFFF00>So Mi-poong is still this family's
daughter-in-law. If something good</font>

167
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:24,047
<font color=#FFFF00>has happened to our in-laws, we should
definitely go congratulate them.</font>

168
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:28,418
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you tell me not to go.</font>

169
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:29,692
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

170
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,536
<font color=#FFFF00>If you keep this up, I...</font>

171
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:36,610
<font color=#FFFF00>can't live with you!</font>

172
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,337
<font color=#FFFF00>You insolent thing!</font>

173
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:45,920
<font color=#FFFF00>You no-good-at-all wench! Fine!
Let's split up! Split up!</font>

174
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,354
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to live with you either!</font>

175
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, are you okay?</font>

176
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,356
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Nam-yi.</font>

177
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Won-bin, I told you that I
don't want to come here.</font>

178
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:30,692
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going now.</font>

179
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:35,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell your father not to use
you to call me here again.</font>

180
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:39,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Nam-yi, my father was
wrong yesterday, but you</font>

181
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,510
<font color=#FFFF00>should still talk to him to work things out.</font>

182
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,684
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and talk. I'll be going now.</font>

183
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:52,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Like I told you yesterday, I really
don't think we're meant to be.</font>

184
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,864
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be going then. Good-bye.</font>

185
00:13:58,685 --> 00:13:59,786
<font color=#FFFF00>We're...</font>

186
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:01,161
<font color=#FFFF00>meant to be!</font>

187
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

188
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:09,426
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that the ring that went
into your mouth yesterday?</font>

189
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, you're right! It's the
ring you prepared for us!</font>

190
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:15,183
<font color=#FFFF00>But where did you get that ring from?</font>

191
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,176
<font color=#FFFF00>You had definitely eaten it yesterday!</font>

192
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:25,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you...?</font>

193
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,794
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

194
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:29,716
<font color=#FFFF00>How...?</font>

195
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you been well, Mr. Kim?</font>

196
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:46,504
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while, Mr. Cha.</font>

197
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,203
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

198
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,606
<font color=#FFFF00>I have some business with the law firm here.</font>

199
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:55,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to contact you anyways.</font>

200
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:57,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

201
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,731
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there something I should know about?</font>

202
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,242
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about your granddaughter
entering into your family registry.</font>

203
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,113
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a procedure, so the earliest
I can get it done is in a month.</font>

204
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,442
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

205
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:13,220
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you wanted it done as
soon as possible. I'm sorry.</font>

206
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,859
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

207
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:18,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I never said that.</font>

208
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:19,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

209
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:24,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo's wife, who lives with your
granddaughter, called me directly.</font>

210
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:27,829
<font color=#FFFF00>She said that you're in a hurry,
so she wants me to enter your</font>

211
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,821
<font color=#FFFF00>granddaughter into your family
registry as soon as possible.</font>

212
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:32,643
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

213
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:46,557
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

214
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:53,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo and Ms. Chun said
that Shin-ae is an imposter.</font>

215
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo's wife, who lives with your
granddaughter, called me directly.</font>

216
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:02,031
<font color=#FFFF00>She said that you're in a hurry,
so she wants me to enter your</font>

217
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,058
<font color=#FFFF00>granddaughter into your family
registry as soon as possible.</font>

218
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Shin-ae want me to die quickly?</font>

219
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,346
<font color=#FFFF00>(99.99% Match. Kim Dae-hoon and Park
Shin-ae are father and daughter.)</font>

220
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:40,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have become doubtful
because of my old age.</font>

221
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:48,463
<font color=#FFFF00>She's my one and only granddaughter.
My bloodline.</font>

222
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:07,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae is getting very
stressed because of Dae-hoon.</font>

223
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:10,503
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, yes.</font>

224
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,695
<font color=#FFFF00>I should understand.</font>

225
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:30,409
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, Yoo-jin, is
Shin-ae nice to you nowadays?</font>

226
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, she is.</font>

227
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:34,706
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

228
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:37,104
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't get angry at you?</font>

229
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:40,711
<font color=#FFFF00>No. As long as I call her
mom only when it's just the</font>

230
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:43,818
<font color=#FFFF00>two of us, she neither scolds
me nor gets angry at me.</font>

231
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:46,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

232
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:48,276
<font color=#FFFF00>But Mr. Kim,</font>

233
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:54,439
<font color=#FFFF00>you didn't tell anyone that
Aunt Shin-ae is my real mom, right?</font>

234
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:57,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course I didn't.</font>

235
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,688
<font color=#FFFF00>I promised to keep this a secret.</font>

236
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:05,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.</font>

237
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:09,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

238
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:13,170
<font color=#FFFF00>What do mean?</font>

239
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin.</font>

240
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,341
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean
Aunt Shin-ae is your real mom?</font>

241
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,025
<font color=#FFFF00>T-That's...</font>

242
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,871
<font color=#FFFF00>N-No, Hee-dong.</font>

243
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,440
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't say anything.</font>

244
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:39,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin isn't Shin-ae's daughter.</font>

245
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:42,463
<font color=#FFFF00>She really isn't.</font>

246
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:44,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Right, Yoo-jin?</font>

247
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:46,972
<font color=#FFFF00>He's right!</font>

248
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:52,703
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not my mom's daughter. Really!</font>

249
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,456
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin.</font>

250
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,354
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not true.</font>

251
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,436
<font color=#FFFF00>If my mom finds out about this...</font>

252
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,034
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

253
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:18,023
<font color=#FFFF00>If Aunt Shin-ae finds out about this,
I'll be in big trouble!</font>

254
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:43,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin is...?</font>

255
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:55,354
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin, what do we do?</font>

256
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,158
<font color=#FFFF00>This secret was only supposed
to be between the three of us.</font>

257
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:04,390
<font color=#FFFF00>If Shin-ae finds out we were caught by
Hee-dong, she won't just sit and watch. Right?</font>

258
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,854
<font color=#FFFF00>Then Mr. Kim,</font>

259
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:14,051
<font color=#FFFF00>should I call mom and confess to
her that we got caught by Mr. Jo?</font>

260
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no! You can't! You can't, Yoo-jin!</font>

261
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how scary Shin-ae is?</font>

262
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:27,067
<font color=#FFFF00>If Shin-ae finds out about this, you
might really be kicked out this time!</font>

263
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,396
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

264
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:34,209
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, I don't want to be kicked out!</font>

265
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to be separated from you!</font>

266
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:39,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim!</font>

267
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't cry. Don't cry, Yoo-jin.</font>

268
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,592
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to be
separated from you either.</font>

269
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:48,131
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't cry.</font>

270
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:53,615
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to go back to the orphanage.</font>

271
00:20:58,146 --> 00:20:59,146
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't cry, Yoo-jin.</font>

272
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:02,100
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll protect you.</font>

273
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:07,287
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take care of everything, so don't cry.</font>

274
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,061
<font color=#FFFF00>Just trust me. Okay?</font>

275
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,225
<font color=#FFFF00>How?</font>

276
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:23,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, come in.</font>

277
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:26,834
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong...</font>

278
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:29,560
<font color=#FFFF00>can I come in?</font>

279
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,287
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, father. Come on in.</font>

280
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,389
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems like you have something
to tell me. Go ahead.</font>

281
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,647
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a favor to ask of you.</font>

282
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,225
<font color=#FFFF00>You must do it for me, okay?</font>

283
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:04,194
<font color=#FFFF00>What favor? I should do it.</font>

284
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:08,070
<font color=#FFFF00>So, the thing is, Hee-dong...</font>

285
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:12,771
<font color=#FFFF00>About what you heard earlier...</font>

286
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:15,646
<font color=#FFFF00>About Yoo-jin being Shin-ae's daughter.</font>

287
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:20,178
<font color=#FFFF00>You can never tell anyone, okay?</font>

288
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

289
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,815
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

290
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:30,334
<font color=#FFFF00>That was a secret between
Yoo-jin and Shin-ae.</font>

291
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,902
<font color=#FFFF00>But I found out, and Yoo-jin got in trouble.</font>

292
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:39,202
<font color=#FFFF00>And Yoo-jin almost got kicked out
of this house because of that.</font>

293
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:45,662
<font color=#FFFF00>So if you act like you know about it, she
might really be kicked out this time.</font>

294
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:51,226
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't even tell my
father because of that.</font>

295
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:56,865
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, you'll keep this
a secret, won't you?</font>

296
00:22:57,248 --> 00:23:01,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You can never tell anyone
about it, all right?</font>

297
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin, I'm here. What are
you doing here by yourself?</font>

298
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:32,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Come with me. A great man came today.</font>

299
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You can say hi to him and-</font>

300
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,543
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't see you.</font>

301
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,426
<font color=#FFFF00>Go, Hee-dong.</font>

302
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,220
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean you can't see me?</font>

303
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,091
<font color=#FFFF00>Did someone tell you not to see me?</font>

304
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:51,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Since Shin-ae and Yoo-jin are
wearing the same headbands...</font>

305
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:53,736
<font color=#FFFF00>they look exactly alike.</font>

306
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:56,512
<font color=#FFFF00>They're like mom and daughter.</font>

307
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:45,207
<font color=#FFFF00>Joo-ri, do you have a boyfriend?</font>

308
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still single?</font>

309
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:51,911
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a divorcee.</font>

310
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:55,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh. You were married before.</font>

311
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:57,681
<font color=#FFFF00>What about kids?</font>

312
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a daughter and son.</font>

313
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:02,895
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really?</font>

314
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:05,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were single!</font>

315
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,904
<font color=#FFFF00>Who would think you have kids already?</font>

316
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:10,661
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for seeing it that way.</font>

317
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,786
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing I have to worry about.</font>

318
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:17,630
<font color=#FFFF00>She's twelve years older
than Jang-soo, and on top of</font>

319
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:20,137
<font color=#FFFF00>that, she's a divorcee with a
daughter and a son already.</font>

320
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:29,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Jang-soo!</font>

321
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:35,036
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Go where with you?</font>

322
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't Jang-go going to get a divorce?</font>

323
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:41,724
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't go there.</font>

324
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:47,856
<font color=#FFFF00>The one who is planning to get a divorce but
invites her in-laws to dinner is a fool.</font>

325
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:51,098
<font color=#FFFF00>The one who accepts the invitation
and goes there is a fool, too.</font>

326
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:55,301
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they decide to cancel the divorce?</font>

327
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. My mother-in-law was waiting
anxiously for Jang-go to get divorced.</font>

328
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:02,388
<font color=#FFFF00>She must be disappointed.</font>

329
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,606
<font color=#FFFF00>- Be careful.
- Be careful. Whoa!</font>

330
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,683
<font color=#FFFF00>- We should turn the gas on.
- Yes.</font>

331
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,247
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, take these.</font>

332
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:14,606
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt Nam-yi!</font>

333
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:17,457
<font color=#FFFF00>- Welcome!
- Thanks. Hello.</font>

334
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:19,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi!</font>

335
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:23,341
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother told me you opened up this
diner, but I get to come here now.</font>

336
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:26,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Your business is doing well enough to
enter home shopping. Congratulations.</font>

337
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,778
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here's cake.
- You didn't have to bring anything. Thank you.</font>

338
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:34,496
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow! It's cake. What kind of cake is it?</font>

339
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,841
<font color=#FFFF00>I picked the strawberry cream cake.
Is that okay?</font>

340
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:40,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's okay. I love strawberries.</font>

341
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please sit here.
- Sure.</font>

342
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:46,016
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you make so much?</font>

343
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,636
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's no joke, right, aunt?
- Right.</font>

344
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:51,004
<font color=#FFFF00>Please eat.</font>

345
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:55,708
<font color=#FFFF00>But Mi-poong, how did you think
about entering home shopping?</font>

346
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:59,536
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no. I didn't think of it.</font>

347
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:01,864
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo, you got it wrong.
Home shopping found out</font>

348
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:04,013
<font color=#FFFF00>about these dumplings and
came to look for them.</font>

349
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:05,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really?</font>

350
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

351
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:13,117
<font color=#FFFF00>At the senior center I go to, one
of the old ladies' son was trying</font>

352
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,438
<font color=#FFFF00>so hard to enter home shopping,
but in the end, he couldn't.</font>

353
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,562
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard it's like trying to pluck a star
from the sky. You're amazing, Ms. Joo.</font>

354
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:25,807
<font color=#FFFF00>The only thing I know how
to do is make dumplings.</font>

355
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:29,098
<font color=#FFFF00>This happened because Jang-go helped us.</font>

356
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:35,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no. It happened because
the dumplings are delicious.</font>

357
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:38,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope everything works out
and that you'll succeed.</font>

358
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,949
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you'll find your husband as well.</font>

359
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Thank you.</font>

360
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:50,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Then to congratulate Mi-poong's
family's entrance into home shopping...</font>

361
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:52,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheers!</font>

362
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:55,695
<font color=#FFFF00>- Cheers!
- Good luck!</font>

363
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,125
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations!
- Thank you. Please eat a lot.</font>

364
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:14,601
<font color=#FFFF00>If you act cruelly to your
father one more time, I won't</font>

365
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:18,696
<font color=#FFFF00>be able to forgive you, even
if you're my granddaughter.</font>

366
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:23,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

367
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:26,930
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how much I hate Kim Dae-hoon,</font>

368
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:32,199
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't make grandfather doubt me
until I'm on his family registry.</font>

369
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:39,070
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to get along with him, as if
we're really father and daughter.</font>

370
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,365
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yay! Cookies! Cookies! Cookies!
- Cookies!</font>

371
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:14,933
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, say ah.</font>

372
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:20,899
<font color=#FFFF00>How is it?</font>

373
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:22,934
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very, very delicious, Shin-ae!</font>

374
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:25,911
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really?
- Yes!</font>

375
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,461
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin, you, too. Say ah.</font>

376
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:36,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow! Aunt, it melts right in my mouth!</font>

377
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Right? It's really delicious, isn't it?</font>

378
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:40,258
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mr. Kim!</font>

379
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:44,156
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the first time I'm
eating such a delicious cookie.</font>

380
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:47,195
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really?
- It's so delicious.</font>

381
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:56,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, I'm sorry for what
happened in the morning.</font>

382
00:29:57,852 --> 00:29:58,852
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

383
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,586
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Shin-ae.</font>

384
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:03,985
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

385
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:11,140
<font color=#FFFF00>My father said I'm an adult, but I pestered
you like I was a little kid. I'm sorry.</font>

386
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:13,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't do that anymore, okay?</font>

387
00:30:16,102 --> 00:30:19,722
<font color=#FFFF00>No, dad. I'm sorry.</font>

388
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,494
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, dad.</font>

389
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,136
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you guys doing over there?</font>

390
00:30:28,182 --> 00:30:29,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather!</font>

391
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:32,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, did you have a good day?</font>

392
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:34,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

393
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:37,520
<font color=#FFFF00>We were making cookies.</font>

394
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:39,026
<font color=#FFFF00>- Cookies?
- Here.</font>

395
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Try one.</font>

396
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:48,041
<font color=#FFFF00>How is it? It tastes
extremely delicious, right?</font>

397
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:50,083
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. It's very delicious.</font>

398
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:55,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow. The smell of something
delicious is filling the air.</font>

399
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:57,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness! You made cookies!</font>

400
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,130
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, mother.
- Shin-ae made cookies.</font>

401
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,666
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't compare these to the
ones you buy at the market.</font>

402
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:08,516
<font color=#FFFF00>Your daughter is the best. She
made cookies just for you.</font>

403
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:11,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, say ah. Try it.</font>

404
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:13,134
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it. I'll eat it myself.</font>

405
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:21,687
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone is here but Hee-dong.</font>

406
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,116
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he say he'll be late today?</font>

407
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,562
<font color=#FFFF00>No. He'll be home soon.</font>

408
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:27,866
<font color=#FFFF00>Save some for Hee-dong.</font>

409
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, mother.</font>

410
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:32,686
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin, let's make a hundred of these.</font>

411
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,944
<font color=#FFFF00>The test results are out.</font>

412
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,663
<font color=#FFFF00>(DNA Report)</font>

413
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:59,491
<font color=#FFFF00>(DNA Report of Test Results)</font>

414
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:02,804
<font color=#FFFF00>(DNA Test Results)</font>

415
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:09,866
<font color=#FFFF00>(99.99% Match. Park Shin-ae and
Kang Yoo-jin are mother and daughter.)</font>

416
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:46,101
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

417
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you eating rice in water?
With just kimchi?</font>

418
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:57,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. We ate our fill of meat, stir-fried
glass noodles, and dumpling hot pot.</font>

419
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,687
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Try this at least.</font>

420
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:03,015
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo packed this food for you.</font>

421
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:05,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I eat this?</font>

422
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:06,965
<font color=#FFFF00>Then don't eat it.</font>

423
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Your loss.</font>

424
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, grandma. Don't be like that.</font>

425
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:14,515
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, she packed it for you. Try it.</font>

426
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:17,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Look. These stir-fried glass
noodles are very delicious and the</font>

427
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,844
<font color=#FFFF00>mung bean pancakes are to die for.
Totally North Korean style.</font>

428
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,133
<font color=#FFFF00>Try it-</font>

429
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo, do you really want
to go there and be like that?</font>

430
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:28,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know that your
brother got a divorce?</font>

431
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:31,531
<font color=#FFFF00>How could all of you be so thoughtless!</font>

432
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:35,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. You're so noble with
your thoughts, so you</font>

433
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,709
<font color=#FFFF00>should eat rice in water
with just that kimchi.</font>

434
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:40,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo, put all of these
in the refrigerator.</font>

435
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:43,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll eat them deliciously by myself!</font>

436
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll put these over there.</font>

437
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:59,616
<font color=#FFFF00>The wind is blowing so hard,
and it's freezing out here!</font>

438
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:01,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you want to come here?</font>

439
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:03,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong.</font>

440
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:05,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you cold? Come here.</font>

441
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,439
<font color=#FFFF00>How come your ways to get
physical contact are</font>

442
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,411
<font color=#FFFF00>becoming more and more
sneaky as you get older?</font>

443
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,271
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to hug and kiss with
every opportunity you get.</font>

444
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:16,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Just say what you have to say.
I'm freezing to death.</font>

445
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim Mi-poong, close your eyes.</font>

446
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:28,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep telling me to close my eyes?
Just say it. I'm cold.</font>

447
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:35,091
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! How can you be so tactless?</font>

448
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:37,721
<font color=#FFFF00>If a guy tells you to close
his eyes to create a</font>

449
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:40,271
<font color=#FFFF00>mood, don't you have the
sense to go along with it?</font>

450
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Any other man would've ran
away a long time ago.</font>

451
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,935
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the only one willing
to stick around you.</font>

452
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,904
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're going to keep being so
ridiculous, I'm going to leave first.</font>

453
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:49,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, okay!</font>

454
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:51,591
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. All right.</font>

455
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,396
<font color=#FFFF00>Take out your hand.</font>

456
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:55,966
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why?
- Just hurry up and take out your hand!</font>

457
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:05,748
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

458
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:07,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you tell? It's a ring.</font>

459
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:14,427
<font color=#FFFF00>It's to commemorate a fresh start
for you and a new beginning for us.</font>

460
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,317
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to propose to you by saying
that we should never separate again.</font>

461
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:20,640
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all ruined because of you.</font>

462
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:26,615
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go.</font>

463
00:35:27,412 --> 00:35:28,412
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

464
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,763
<font color=#FFFF00>All this time, I was really struggling.</font>

465
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:38,263
<font color=#FFFF00>But I was able to endure it because of you.</font>

466
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,724
<font color=#FFFF00>I was really mean to you.</font>

467
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:51,504
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for not leaving
me and staying by my side.</font>

468
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,169
<font color=#FFFF00>At least you know.</font>

469
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:01,060
<font color=#FFFF00>If you had done this from
the beginning, I would've</font>

470
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:04,446
<font color=#FFFF00>put the ring on you and
we would've kissed. How nice-</font>

471
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:10,235
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, it's cold!</font>

<font color=#FFFF00><i>The one person</i></font>

477
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,437
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

478
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:07,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Hee-dong not come home last night?</font>

479
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:13,304
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he sleeping in his studio?</font>

480
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:23,118
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't even call me.</font>

481
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:25,961
<font color=#FFFF00>He has never done this before.</font>

482
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:34,755
<font color=#FFFF00>The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</font>

483
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:38,664
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not answering his phone.</font>

484
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,609
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he get into an accident?</font>

485
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

486
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Where were you?</font>

487
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:52,124
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you sleep last night?</font>

488
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, did something happen?</font>

489
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:04,266
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

490
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,234
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

491
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, what are you doing?</font>

492
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:13,134
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going somewhere?</font>

493
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:19,536
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, why are you doing this? You need
to tell me so that I know what's going on.</font>

496
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,375
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

497
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:31,734
<font color=#FFFF00>A divorce?</font>

498
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Why...?</font>

499
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, what's wrong with you?</font>

500
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,570
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

503
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong...</font>

504
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:10,049
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I'll be able
to live with you anymore.</font>

505
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong! Hee-dong...</font>

506
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:21,274
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to hear any excuse.</font>

507
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:26,866
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to know why you abandoned
Yoo-jin in the orphanage to deceive me.</font>

508
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:30,774
<font color=#FFFF00>My feelings for you are all broken now.</font>

509
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:37,445
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to understand any
of your excuses, so don't stop me.</font>

510
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:42,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong...</font>

511

<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong! Hee-dong!</font>

513
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,522
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll call you as soon as the
divorce papers are ready.</font>

514
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:58,312
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? Divorce papers?</font>

515
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,173
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I'm going to divorce her.</font>

516
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,834
<font color=#FFFF00>Just know that. I'll tell
you the details later.</font>

517
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey...Hee-dong! Hee-dong!
Hee-dong! Hee-dong-</font>

518
00:40:18,055 --> 00:40:19,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to you two?</font>

519
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:21,632
<font color=#FFFF00>What does he mean divorce?
Did you two fight?</font>

520
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,836
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is Hee-dong suddenly acting like that?</font>

521
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Hee-dong have another woman?
Is he having an affair?</font>

522
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,376
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing like that.</font>

523
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not! Hee-dong would
never do such a thing!</font>

524
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,247
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what is it?</font>

525
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:37,273
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you do something wrong?</font>

526
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,226
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not!</font>

527
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:43,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why would Hee-dong mention divorce?
For what reason?</font>

528
00:40:44,086 --> 00:40:47,359
<font color=#FFFF00>I nagged him about going on a
business trip. That's why.</font>

529
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:49,384
<font color=#FFFF00>What? You nagged him?</font>

530
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:53,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. He wouldn't bring up divorce
for such a reason. Don't be ridiculous.</font>

531
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:56,813
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

532
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:03,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there something you're hiding from me?</font>

533
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:06,852
<font color=#FFFF00>What would I hide from you?</font>

534
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:08,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why is Hee-dong acting that way?</font>

535
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:23,203
<font color=#FFFF00>This is strange.</font>

536
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:37,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin, did you tell Mr. Jo
Hee-dong that I'm your mom? Did you?</font>

537
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:44,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't tell him myself.</font>

538
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:51,820
<font color=#FFFF00>He overheard Mr. Kim Dae-hoon and I talking.</font>

539
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:53,852
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

540
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:59,797
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I told you not to
tell anyone that I'm your mom.</font>

541
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,000
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to be careful!</font>

542
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:04,812
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do now?</font>

543
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:12,116
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want Mr. Jo Hee-dong to find
out everything and divorce me?</font>

544
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

545
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:18,601
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

546
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,719
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

547
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:30,773
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm sorry.</font>

548
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,656
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay. Everything will be okay.</font>

549
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:35,789

- Okay.</font>

552
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:06,148
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so strange.</font>

553
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:10,268
<font color=#FFFF00>We made it the same way we make it in the
diner, so why does it taste different?</font>

554
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,349
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because the factory
make it in massive amounts.</font>

555
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:16,531
<font color=#FFFF00>What can we do?</font>

556
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:21,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, the biggest problem we
have is the smell of pork.</font>

557
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:25,312
<font color=#FFFF00>If we want to get rid of it,
shouldn't we put in more ginger?</font>

558
00:43:26,555 --> 00:43:32,140
<font color=#FFFF00>That would be a good way,
but people don't like it.</font>

559
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:35,277
<font color=#FFFF00>We can dice the ginger into tiny
bits and put them in there.</font>

560
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:41,535
<font color=#FFFF00>Our dumplings are aromatic and chewy,
but how come these aren't like that?</font>

561
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:45,216
<font color=#FFFF00>Are we missing any ingredients?
Or did we leave something out?</font>

562
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me the recipe.</font>

563
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,786
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, look here. It was this.</font>

564
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,692
<font color=#FFFF00>We mix dried bean curd and tofu
together, but here, they only used raw</font>

565
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:06,618
<font color=#FFFF00>tofu, so that's why it didn't have
that aromatic and chewy taste.</font>

566
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:13,203
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I see. I'll go to the factory
and tell the factory manager.</font>

567
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:15,227

<font color=#FFFF00>Please give this to the chairman.</font>

572
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:02,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

573
00:45:19,037 --> 00:45:22,025
<font color=#FFFF00>(Please approve this/Inspection Division)</font>

574
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:32,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, mom.</font>

575
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:36,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Your friend wants legal advice?</font>

576
00:45:39,852 --> 00:45:41,476
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I'll be on my way.</font>

577
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,297
<font color=#FFFF00>You were desperate, so I
arranged this meeting,</font>

578
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:51,659
<font color=#FFFF00>but I don't know if I should be doing this.</font>

579
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:55,631
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like your son and your
daughter-in-law are completely over yet.</font>

580
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:58,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even mention her.</font>

581
00:45:58,313 --> 00:45:59,713
<font color=#FFFF00>They're over already.</font>

582
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:03,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, I'm doing this
because I trust you, so</font>

583
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:06,054
<font color=#FFFF00>make sure you don't put me
in a troubling position.</font>

584
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, all right. Don't worry.</font>

585
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,877
<font color=#FFFF00>But is she really such a fine young lady?</font>

586
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:12,196
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

587
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:16,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr. Yoon's father is the director of a
famous hospital in Gangnam, and she owns</font>

588
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:19,717
<font color=#FFFF00>several properties in Gangnam, so she
doesn't care about the man's wealth.</font>

589
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:23,764
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, Dr. Yoon isn't someone
who would come to such a meeting, but</font>

590
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:27,218
<font color=#FFFF00>she is a divorcee, like your son, so
that's why she's coming out today.</font>

591
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor. Daughter of a hospital director.
Building.</font>

592
00:46:32,016 --> 00:46:34,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, this family
doesn't look at money.</font>

593
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Only the personality. Your son
has a fine personality.</font>

594
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:41,906
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course! He's kind,
amiable, and good-looking!</font>

595
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:44,922
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go won't lose to anyone.</font>

596
00:46:44,947 --> 00:46:48,836
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she needed legal advice, so I
used that as an excuse to bring her here.</font>

597
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:52,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Young-soon. You're the best!</font>

598
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:55,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

599
00:46:57,742 --> 00:46:58,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

600
00:47:01,664 --> 00:47:04,757
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Lawyer Lee Jang-go's mother.
She's my friend.</font>

601
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:07,125
<font color=#FFFF00>We came together. That's
okay with you, isn't it?</font>

602
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

603
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:09,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

604
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:13,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you get good legal
advice from my son.</font>

605
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,958
<font color=#FFFF00>You can get more comfortable
with each other,</font>

606
00:47:15,984 --> 00:47:18,023
<font color=#FFFF00>and it'd be great if you
two became good friends.</font>

607
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:21,562
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom.
- Hi.</font>

608
00:47:22,149 --> 00:47:23,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. Hello.</font>

609
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:26,519
<font color=#FFFF00>You know my friend Ms. Lee
Young-soon, don't you?</font>

610
00:47:27,034 --> 00:47:28,735
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. Hello.</font>

611
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:33,077
<font color=#FFFF00>This young lady is Ms. Lee's
best friend's daughter.</font>

612
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:37,448
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she needed legal advice, so
Ms. Lee asked me to ask you for help.</font>

613
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,906
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that okay with you?</font>

614
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:40,125
<font color=#FFFF00>That's fine.</font>

615
00:47:41,094 --> 00:47:46,734
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, give her good legal advice, for
the sake of me and my friend. Okay?</font>

616
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

617
00:47:48,547 --> 00:47:50,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, we should go grocery shopping.</font>

618
00:47:51,016 --> 00:47:52,016
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

619
00:47:55,297 --> 00:47:57,531
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a good counseling session, Dr. Yoon.
- Okay.</font>

620
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:08,093
<font color=#FFFF00>She's more calm and pure than
you told me she is. I like her!</font>

621
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you so. Besides being a divorcee,
she doesn't have any other flaw.</font>

622
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyways, I hope it works out well. If
it does, I'll buy you a nice dinner.</font>

623
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:19,668
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, but I still
feel guilty about this.</font>

624
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:25,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Their divorce isn't final yet. What will
we do later on if something goes wrong?</font>

625
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:28,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Their divorce will be finalized once
the consideration period is over.</font>

626
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:33,652
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go with him this time if I have to and
make sure he gets divorced, so don't worry</font>

627
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:34,813
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

628
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:35,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

629
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:39,555
<font color=#FFFF00>You bought land in Jeju-do to build a villa?</font>

630
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, but there's a cemetery on that land, so</font>

631
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:44,697
<font color=#FFFF00>they said I can't construct anything there.</font>

632
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,038
<font color=#FFFF00>The one who sold the land to me said
he can't return the deposit to me.</font>

633
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:50,507
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I do in this
situation to get it back?</font>

634
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,326
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you bring the contract with you?</font>

635
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,615
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I couldn't because I came
straight from the hospital.</font>

636
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:58,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Then can you send me the contract?</font>

637
00:48:58,844 --> 00:49:00,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll examine it and try to find a solution.</font>

638
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:04,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'll find the contract
and send it to you.</font>

639
00:49:04,563 --> 00:49:05,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

640
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:12,975
<font color=#FFFF00>What would you like to eat?</font>

641
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,790
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm fine.</font>

642
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:21,140
<font color=#FFFF00>You're giving me legal advice, so if you
go without eating, I'll feel too guilty.</font>

643
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:24,077
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll buy you lunch as a
means of thanking you.</font>

644
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:27,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really fine though...</font>

645
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:29,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give us Course A.</font>

646
00:49:36,922 --> 00:49:38,012
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you serious?</font>

647
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:39,953
<font color=#FFFF00>She really likes Jang-go?</font>

648
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

649
00:49:43,305 --> 00:49:46,015
<font color=#FFFF00>She likes how thoughtful Jang-go is?</font>

650
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:49,507
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I hope it works out well!</font>

651
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:51,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Bye.</font>

652
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:00,547
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

653
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:04,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something good happen?</font>

654
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:07,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I heard good news.</font>

655
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,632
<font color=#FFFF00>What good news?</font>

656
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:14,077
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go is going to have a good woman.</font>

657
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:16,507
<font color=#FFFF00>A woman who is far better than Mi-poong.</font>

658
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:20,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Dream on.</font>

659
00:50:20,844 --> 00:50:23,577
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go and Mi-poong will never break up.</font>

660
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:28,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go and Mi-poong exchanged rings
yesterday and decided to start over again.</font>

661
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,531
<font color=#FFFF00>So wake up from your silly dream.</font>

662
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:35,531
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Exchanged rings?</font>

663
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:45,539
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

664
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,860
<font color=#FFFF00>It's that ring, the one
you got from Jang-go.</font>

665
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:56,031
<font color=#FFFF00>You-</font>

666
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:06,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, I don't want to
get angry at you anymore.</font>

667
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:08,976
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk with the facts.</font>

668
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,385
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Jang-go broke up.</font>

669
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,414
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you were going to divorce him.</font>

670
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,058
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you two should start new lives.</font>

671
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:21,101
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go needs to meet a good woman.
You should meet a new</font>

672
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:24,397
<font color=#FFFF00>man, too. Both of you should
go your own ways in life.</font>

673
00:51:24,742 --> 00:51:26,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you exchange rings?</font>

674
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:30,314
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Jang-go can't be together.</font>

675
00:51:30,774 --> 00:51:33,023
<font color=#FFFF00>So give me that ring.</font>

676
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:38,203
<font color=#FFFF00>Take it off. Take off that ring.</font>

677
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:44,294
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, Jang-go gave me this ring.
I can never take it off.</font>

678
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:45,703
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

679
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,922
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't take it off?
Take it off right now.</font>

680
00:51:48,242 --> 00:51:52,575
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take off that ring right now!
- Mother, why are you doing this?</font>

681
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:55,617
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you be so stubborn?</font>

682
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you or did you not promise to separate
from Jang-go after getting the $50,000?</font>

683
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:01,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Is $50,000 not enough?</font>

684
00:52:02,531 --> 00:52:05,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you clinging onto Jang-go? Why?</font>

685
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,773
<font color=#FFFF00>How much more do you want from him?</font>

686
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:10,000
<font color=#FFFF00>- Give me that ring!
- Why are you dong this?</font>

687
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:12,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness! Why are you being like this?</font>

688
00:52:12,636 --> 00:52:14,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here again
upsetting my daughter?</font>

689
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:17,718
<font color=#FFFF00>If you have eyes, you
should take a good look.</font>

690
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:20,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to drag this out anymore.</font>

691
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:24,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Just take that ring off her
hand and give it to me.</font>

692
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,715
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, but I can't do that.</font>

693
00:52:28,336 --> 00:52:30,608
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go and Mi-poong are both grown adults.</font>

694
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:34,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep meddling into their affairs?</font>

695
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it look like I can't meddle?</font>

696
00:52:39,742 --> 00:52:45,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to say this, but it's all
Mi-poong's fault that Jang-go got hurt!</font>

697
00:52:45,774 --> 00:52:48,568
<font color=#FFFF00>He got hurt because Mi-poong's
fortune has widowhood and a</font>

698
00:52:48,593 --> 00:52:50,993
<font color=#FFFF00>white tiger in it, so she's
bound to destroy a man's life!</font>

699
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:54,944
<font color=#FFFF00>But you want me to leave my son to be
with her? She's going to destroy him!</font>

700
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:57,399
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What did you say?</font>

701
00:52:57,789 --> 00:52:59,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Who destroys who?</font>

702
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:01,325
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say such crude things?</font>

703
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:06,039
<font color=#FFFF00>If you really don't want Jang-go
and Mi-poong seeing each other,</font>

704
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:10,593
<font color=#FFFF00>then you can tie him up at home!</font>

705
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,995
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have the confidence
to stop Jang-go from coming</font>

706
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,571
<font color=#FFFF00>to see Mi-poong, so you
stop him from coming here!</font>

707
00:53:16,596 --> 00:53:17,596
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

708
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:19,633
<font color=#FFFF00>Outrageous!</font>

709
00:53:20,828 --> 00:53:25,711
<font color=#FFFF00>So that means the both of you are
going to ruin my son's future.</font>

710
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:28,335
<font color=#FFFF00>What stubborn creatures you are!</font>

711
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:31,477
<font color=#FFFF00>- Give me that ring!
- Why are you doing this?</font>

712
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:32,919
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of this hand!</font>

713
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,351
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you push me!</font>

714
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:39,246
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you doing this?</font>

715
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:46,101
<font color=#FFFF00>- Give it to me!
- What do you think you're doing at my diner?</font>

716
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:48,023
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out!
- Mom!</font>

717
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,885
<font color=#FFFF00>- If you come here one more time,
I'll call the cops on you!
- Mom!</font>

718
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:59,164
<font color=#FFFF00>What the heck do you think you're doing?</font>

719
00:53:59,189 --> 00:54:01,861
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. What does
she think she's doing?</font>

720
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:03,609
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

721
00:54:18,164 --> 00:54:20,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't ask for you to come here
so that I can give you an excuse.</font>

722
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:27,117
<font color=#FFFF00>But I wanted to tell you why I did that.</font>

723
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:32,484
<font color=#FFFF00>When Yoo-jin first came to Korea,</font>

724
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't care about other people,</font>

725
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:41,984
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was scared you would
find out about her.</font>

726
00:54:42,883 --> 00:54:47,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I was scared you would get hurt like this.</font>

727
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,311
<font color=#FFFF00>So is that why you sent
Yoo-jin to the orphanage?</font>

728
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,023
<font color=#FFFF00>You lied to everyone.</font>

729
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:58,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You even made little Yoo-jin lie.</font>

730
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,343
<font color=#FFFF00>For what reason?</font>

731
00:55:05,484 --> 00:55:06,484
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

732
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:11,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you would be disappointed in me.</font>

733
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:15,616
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to tell you
about my pathetic past.</font>

734
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,562
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you so much.</font>

735
00:55:18,477 --> 00:55:19,617
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I did that.</font>

736
00:55:20,508 --> 00:55:22,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, please believe that.</font>

737
00:55:24,227 --> 00:55:25,734
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand you.</font>

738
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:34,016
<font color=#FFFF00>And I can't...
believe anything you say anymore.</font>

739
00:55:36,102 --> 00:55:37,822
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet at court as soon as possible.</font>

740
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:39,031
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

741
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,265
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to divorce you.</font>

742
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:48,247
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, forgive me just this once.
Hee-dong, trust me just this once.</font>

743
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:07,289
<font color=#FFFF00>If grandfather finds out, he'll
be disappointed and doubt me.</font>

744
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:11,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother won't just sit still. What do I do?</font>

745
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:20,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, Hee-dong won't tell anyone the
reason of our divorce for Yoo-jin's sake.</font>

746
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:23,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Never.</font>

747
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:26,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to make sure he can never say it.</font>

748
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:30,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin, what are you doing?</font>

749
00:56:31,523 --> 00:56:32,761
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's watch a cartoon movie.</font>

750
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:36,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.</font>

751
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:38,996
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch it by yourself.</font>

752
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:44,583
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? Why are you packing your bag?</font>

753
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:46,991
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going somewhere?</font>

754
00:56:47,173 --> 00:56:50,092
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go back to the orphanage.</font>

755
00:56:51,297 --> 00:56:52,644
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

756
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:55,590
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you didn't want
to go to the orphanage.</font>

757
00:56:56,445 --> 00:57:00,374
<font color=#FFFF00>I think my mom and Mr. Jo are going
to get a divorce because of me.</font>

758
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:02,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

759
00:57:02,312 --> 00:57:05,273
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I must leave this house.</font>

760
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,929
<font color=#FFFF00>That way, mom and Mr.
Jo won't get a divorce.</font>

761
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:14,987
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae and Hee-dong are going
to get a divorce because of you?</font>

762
00:57:30,594 --> 00:57:32,383
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, it's me.</font>

763
00:57:32,836 --> 00:57:34,734
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, it's an emergency!</font>

764
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:36,665
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and come home! Hurry!</font>

765
00:57:36,898 --> 00:57:37,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Emergency?</font>

766
00:57:38,179 --> 00:57:39,179
<font color=#FFFF00>What emergency?</font>

767
00:57:39,296 --> 00:57:43,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of Yoo-jin, Shin-ae and
Hee-dong are going to get a divorce.</font>

768
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:46,758
<font color=#FFFF00>So Yoo-jin is packing her bag
to go back to the orphanage.</font>

769
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:51,120
<font color=#FFFF00>So come here quickly and make
sure Shin-ae and Hee-dong can't</font>

770
00:57:51,145 --> 00:57:54,859
<font color=#FFFF00>get a divorce! And make sure
Yoo-jin can still live with us!</font>

771
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:58,103
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't live without Yoo-jin, father!</font>

772
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:03,960
<font color=#FFFF00>And since Yoo-jin is Shin-ae's daughter,
doesn't that mean she's my granddaughter?</font>

773
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:08,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, what are you talking about?</font>

774
00:58:16,898 --> 00:58:17,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

775
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

776
00:58:22,414 --> 00:58:23,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

777
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:25,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

778
00:58:33,648 --> 00:58:39,687
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae, why didn't you tell me?
Why did you hide it?</font>

779
00:58:41,156 --> 00:58:43,195
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean...?</font>

780
00:58:44,328 --> 00:58:47,616
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard Yoo-jin is your daughter.</font>

781
00:58:49,531 --> 00:58:50,531
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather...</font>

782
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:54,038
<font color=#FFFF00>If Yoo-jin is your daughter, then
she's my great-granddaughter.</font>

783
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,679
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you hide this from me?</font>

784
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:02,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand you hiding this from everyone
else, but you should have told me.</font>

785
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:04,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, grandfather.</font>

786
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:09,709
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't tell you because I
knew you would be disappointed.</font>

787
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:14,094
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say that? I'm not a stranger.
I'm your grandfather.</font>

788
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:18,764
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm your grandfather who can
embrace all your flaws.</font>

789
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:21,087
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell me? Why?</font>

790
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:23,375
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

791
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:27,369
<font color=#FFFF00>Fortunately, I had brought
Yoo-jin home that time.</font>

792
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:31,820
<font color=#FFFF00>What if I hadn't brought her? She would
have still been at that orphanage.</font>

793
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:35,461
<font color=#FFFF00>That was why I was going to adopt her.</font>

794
00:59:35,914 --> 00:59:38,337
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What do you mean adopt her?</font>

795
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:40,611
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say such a thing?</font>

796
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:45,469
<font color=#FFFF00>You were going to adopt the
child you gave birth to?</font>

797
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:49,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, I love Hee-dong.</font>

798
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:54,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I did that because I was scared Hee-dong
would be disappointed and leave me.</font>

799
00:59:55,703 --> 00:59:58,273
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, please help me.</font>

800
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong wants to get a divorce.</font>

801
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:04,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't live without Hee-dong.</font>

802
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:10,135
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, please stop Hee-dong.</font>

803
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:18,952
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, why are you suddenly
talking about divorce?</font>

804
01:00:20,257 --> 01:00:22,126
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have another woman?</font>

805
01:00:24,023 --> 01:00:27,290
<font color=#FFFF00>No, right? Then why do you
want to get a divorce?</font>

806
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,701
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and come home before
your father or Mr. Kim finds out.</font>

807
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:31,726
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

808
01:00:32,664 --> 01:00:35,101
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell you the reason later.</font>

809
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:38,349
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry.
- Seriously, what's wrong with you?</font>

810
01:00:38,937 --> 01:00:40,987
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to see me die?</font>

811
01:00:41,526 --> 01:00:46,114
<font color=#FFFF00>I can endure everything else, but I
can't see you go through a divorce.</font>

812
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:48,796
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you won't be able to get
in touch with me, don't worry.</font>

813
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:50,146
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Hee-dong!</font>

814
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,352
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't find a woman like
Shin-ae anywhere in this world!</font>

815
01:00:54,898 --> 01:00:58,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae was very good to you.
She's very good to me, too.</font>

816
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:01,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, look at this necklace.
Shin-ae bought it for me.</font>

817
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:04,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, I can't live without Shin-ae.</font>

818
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:09,374
<font color=#FFFF00>- If you divorce her, I'll bite my tongue and die!
- Mom.</font>

819
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:14,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim's inheritance will all become yours
later on. Are you going to give that up?</font>

820
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:19,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to continue living with
Shin-ae just for grandfather's inheritance?</font>

821
01:01:20,203 --> 01:01:22,022
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not all...</font>

822
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:26,045
<font color=#FFFF00>You like Shin-ae. You love her.</font>

823
01:01:26,442 --> 01:01:28,351
<font color=#FFFF00>How can love change?</font>

824
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:35,566
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, grandfather.</font>

825
01:01:38,343 --> 01:01:39,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now?</font>

826
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:43,148
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

827
01:01:43,624 --> 01:01:45,866
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Mr. Kim want to see you right now?</font>

828
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:52,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae must have told Mr. Kim.</font>

829
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:57,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that Mr. Kim stepped in,
I won't have to worry about divorce.</font>

830
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:01,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong,</font>

831
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:05,015
<font color=#FFFF00>must you get a divorce?</font>

832
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:09,087
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, grandfather.</font>

833
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:13,679
<font color=#FFFF00>She suffered through all sorts of
things while escaping North Korea.</font>

834
01:02:14,507 --> 01:02:17,285
<font color=#FFFF00>This was something that had happened
in her past before she met you.</font>

835
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:23,093
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it might be hard, but can't
you understand her just this once?</font>

836
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you want to adopt Yoo-jin, too?</font>

837
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:31,453
<font color=#FFFF00>My heart breaks when I think of Yoo-jin.</font>

838
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:34,431
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so sorry for her.</font>

839
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,046
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

840
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:43,366
<font color=#FFFF00>everything is so difficult for
me right now, grandfather.</font>

841
01:02:45,734 --> 01:02:49,577
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like all the time I
spent with Shin-ae is a lie.</font>

842
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:54,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything seems fake.</font>

843
01:02:55,578 --> 01:03:00,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you forgive her just
this one time for my sake?</font>

844
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:09,664
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

845
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:16,776
<font color=#FFFF00>you're saying that Yoo-jin is a kid that
Shin-ae had with another man, right?</font>

846
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:19,278
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what you're saying
right now, isn't it?</font>

847
01:03:19,724 --> 01:03:21,994
<font color=#FFFF00>How could she deceive all of us?</font>

848
01:03:22,634 --> 01:03:25,013
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen?</font>

849
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, grandfather.</font>

850
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:36,317
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong! Hee-dong! Hee-dong!</font>

851
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:39,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong! Hee-dong! Hee-dong!
Hee-dong! Hee-dong!</font>

852
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,255
<font color=#FFFF00>How can this happen?</font>

853
01:03:46,301 --> 01:03:48,247
<font color=#FFFF00>How can this happen?</font>

854
01:03:49,419 --> 01:03:56,067
<font color=#FFFF00>How? How can this happen? What
do I do about my poor Hee-dong?</font>

855
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:05,903
<font color=#FFFF00>How can Shin-ae lie to me as well?</font>

856
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:10,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm her grandfather.</font>

857
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:21,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mr. Choi.</font>

858
01:04:21,513 --> 01:04:25,530
<font color=#FFFF00>There's something I must urgently
report to you about your granddaughter.</font>

859
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:27,123
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

860
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:29,435
<font color=#FFFF00>About my granddaughter?</font>

861
01:04:35,677 --> 01:04:39,513
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a report of Ms. Park
Shin-ae's embezzlement.</font>

862
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:48,084
<font color=#FFFF00>And this document is about the slush
fund she has asked Mr. Heo to prepare.</font>

863
01:04:50,568 --> 01:04:51,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

864
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Slush fund?</font>

865
01:04:55,365 --> 01:04:56,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Embezzlement?</font>

866
01:04:57,943 --> 01:04:59,477
<font color=#FFFF00>My granddaughter did those things?</font>

867
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:08,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is Shin-ae preparing a slush fund?
For what reason?</font>

868
01:05:10,224 --> 01:05:13,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Like Dae-hoon had said, is she
not my real granddaughter?</font>

869
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:20,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying your mother called Shin-ae
an imposter because she has dementia?</font>

870
01:05:20,802 --> 01:05:23,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Or else, how would she say such a thing in</font>

871
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:25,485
<font color=#FFFF00>her sane mind? That wouldn't make any sense.</font>

872
01:05:25,716 --> 01:05:30,013
<font color=#FFFF00>You got the results that Shin-ae is really
your granddaughter through the DNA test.</font>

873
01:05:30,255 --> 01:05:34,444
<font color=#FFFF00>The only ones who know about
Shin-ae's DNA test is Dal-ho and me.</font>

874
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,747
<font color=#FFFF00>How did she know about that?</font>

875
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:50,447
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Dal-ho. It's me.</font>

876
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:52,361
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

877
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:56,330
<font color=#FFFF00>About Shin-ae's DNA test last time...</font>

878
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:59,283
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you tell your wife about it?</font>

879
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:03,069
<font color=#FFFF00>No. We had decided to keep
that between ourselves.</font>

880
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:04,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure?</font>

881
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,924
<font color=#FFFF00>You really didn't tell anyone?</font>

882
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:09,830
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

883
01:06:12,151 --> 01:06:14,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal-ho, come home at once.</font>

884
01:06:18,197 --> 01:06:19,313
<font color=#FFFF00>Something is wrong.</font>

885
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. Mother, what's wrong?</font>

886
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:34,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, what do you think you're doing?</font>

887
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:35,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me yourself.</font>

888
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:39,158
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Yoo-jin your daughter?</font>

889
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:44,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought this was about something else.
Are you like this because of that?</font>

890
01:06:45,197 --> 01:06:47,025
<font color=#FFFF00>You wicked wench! You dirty wench!</font>

891
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:49,783
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you hide your
child and marry Hee-dong?</font>

892
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:53,404
<font color=#FFFF00>You deserve to die! My kind
Hee-dong didn't know she was</font>

893
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:56,994
<font color=#FFFF00>your real daughter. He hugged,
carried, and played with her!</font>

894
01:06:57,478 --> 01:07:01,424
<font color=#FFFF00>If I think of that, I won't be
able to rest in peace when I die!</font>

895
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:08,924
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Yoo-jin is my daughter.</font>

896
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:12,209
<font color=#FFFF00>But that happened in the past
before I had met Hee-dong.</font>

897
01:07:12,385 --> 01:07:14,713
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell anyone who has never had
a past before to come out!</font>

898
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:18,213
<font color=#FFFF00>And did I have an affair while
I was living with Hee-dong?</font>

899
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,301
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you talk back!</font>

900
01:07:21,158 --> 01:07:29,063
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare a nobody like you barge into
my home and break my son's heart!</font>

901
01:07:29,482 --> 01:07:31,205
<font color=#FFFF00>You dirty wench!</font>

902
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:36,223
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to reveal that you're not
Mr. Kim's real granddaughter!</font>

903
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:38,706
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the end for you!</font>

904
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:41,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Do whatever you want!</font>

905
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:44,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'll go down by myself?
You'll go down with me!</font>

906
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:47,329
<font color=#FFFF00>If I go under, do you think you'll be safe?</font>

907
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:51,024
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and reveal that
I'm an imposter if you can!</font>

908
01:07:52,087 --> 01:07:53,087
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

909
01:07:57,806 --> 01:08:02,196
<font color=#FFFF00>S-shin-ae... i-is an imposter?</font>

910
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:11,134
<font color=#FFFF00>She's... not... my granddaughter?</font>

911
01:08:25,524 --> 01:08:27,195
<font color=#FFFF00>(Blow Breeze)</font>

912
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,822
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out!</font>

913
01:08:28,847 --> 01:08:30,421
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going to leave even if I die!</font>

914
01:08:31,181 --> 01:08:33,007
<font color=#FFFF00>I really do love Hee-dong.</font>

915
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:35,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said I wanted to hear such a thing?</font>

916
01:08:35,788 --> 01:08:38,303
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's be honest.</font>

917
01:08:39,687 --> 01:08:42,539
<font color=#FFFF00>The entire inheritance will
be split directly in half!</font>

918
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:44,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Please open this door.</font>

919
01:08:44,055 --> 01:08:46,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I promised to prove your innocence.</font>

920
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:47,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

921
01:08:48,038 --> 01:08:50,459
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so delicious. I can tell
this is going to be a big hit.</font>

922
01:08:50,484 --> 01:08:53,057
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, let's make sure we meet.</font>
