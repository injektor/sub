<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,328
<font color="yellow">Then I guess Shin-ae knows Yoo-jin.</font>

7
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:38,258
<font color="yellow">Of course. She got a lot of help from
Yoo-jin's mother when she was in China.</font>

8
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,789

Did you eat lunch yet?</font>

I'll be home soon.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, please...</font>

24
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,081
<font color="yellow">Lay her down over there.</font>

25
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:53,601
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Here.</font>

26
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,447
<font color="yellow">- Put this blanket over her.
- Okay.</font>

27
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:03,786
<font color="yellow">You woke up.</font>

00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:09,314

<font color="yellow">This is our house.</font>

30
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,789
<font color="yellow">You fell asleep on the
way to the restaurant,</font>

31
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:17,620
<font color="yellow">so we came here instead.
Are you okay with that?</font>

32
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:23,068
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember this place?
You came here with your mom last time.</font>

33
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:28,845
<font color="yellow">Do you want some juice?</font>

34
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,458
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

35
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,914
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go back to the orphanage.</font>

36
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,406
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Yoo-jin?</font>

37
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,773
<font color="yellow">It's okay. This is my house.</font>

38
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:39,843
<font color="yellow">She must have been shocked after waking up.</font>

39
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:41,898

42
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:04,735
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, what happened to you?
I thought you went to China.</font>

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,046
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You're okay now.</font>

44
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:13,936
<font color="yellow">Grandfather. Hee-dong. What happened?</font>

45
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:18,234
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong and I went to the orphanage to take</font>

46
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:22,333
<font color="yellow">photos for the newsletter,
and Yoo-jin was there.</font>

47
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,234
<font color="yellow">The orphanage?</font>

48
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,829
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin was at the orphanage?</font>

49
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,343
<font color="yellow">She's the daughter of
the woman who helped you.</font>

50
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,244
<font color="yellow">How can I just ignore her?
That's why I brought her here.</font>

51
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,933
<font color="yellow">Thank you, grandfather. Thank you, Hee-dong.</font>

52
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:43,546
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, I'm glad you came.</font>

53
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,709
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, did you tell Hee-dong
or Mr. Kim that you met me?</font>

54
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:01,758
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

55
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,774
<font color="yellow">You didn't tell them that I took you
to the orphanage, did you?</font>

56
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,758
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't. As promised,
I didn't tell them anything about you.</font>

57
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:15,921
<font color="yellow">Good job, Yoo-jin.</font>

58
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:21,038
<font color="yellow">You can never talk about me, okay?</font>

59
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,664
<font color="yellow">I'm just an aunt you know, okay?</font>

60
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,133
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

61
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:31,888
<font color="yellow">And this is the first time we met after
the time you came to this house. Okay?</font>

62
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:33,718
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

63
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:37,629
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, let's eat some snacks.</font>

64
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:44,982
<font color="yellow">Looks delicious, Yoo-jin.</font>

65
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:52,739
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, is it good?</font>

66
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,028
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's good! It's amazing!</font>

67
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:02,531
<font color="yellow">But Yoo-jin, don't you have to call
your aunt to let her know you're here?</font>

68
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,235
<font color="yellow">She could go to the orphanage
without knowing you're here.</font>

69
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:11,616
<font color="yellow">I was asking Yoo-jin about her aunt.
She doesn't come to the orphanage anymore.</font>

70
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:15,617
<font color="yellow">She can't get in touch with her either.</font>

71
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:17,898
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

72
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:31,812
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, don't ask Yoo-jin
about her aunt anymore. She'll get hurt.</font>

73
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:36,757
<font color="yellow">That aunt must have left Yoo-jin
behind and gone to China by herself.</font>

74
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,420
<font color="yellow">She was the only one Yoo-jin
could rely on in this world.</font>

75
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,601
<font color="yellow">How could she do such a thing?</font>

76
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:47,448
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

77
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,072
<font color="yellow">I begged him, but he didn't even come home.</font>

78
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,387
<font color="yellow">It's because of that wench!
He's bewitched by her!</font>

79
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:31,166
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be doing this right now.</font>

80
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:36,952
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, come out!</font>

81
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:42,344
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong brought a little girl home,
and she's adorable!</font>

82
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,824
<font color="yellow">Stop being ridiculous!</font>

83
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,100
<font color="yellow">I'm being serious!</font>

84
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:51,938
<font color="yellow">Whatever! I don't care if she's an adult
or a child! That's not important right now!</font>

85
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:55,914
<font color="yellow">What's up with her now?</font>

86
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:58,269
<font color="yellow">That's my mom.</font>

87
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,266
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

88
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,287
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, say hi to her.</font>

89
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,351
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

90
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:09,281
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

91
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,328
<font color="yellow">She's the daughter of that Yanbian woman.</font>

92
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,398
<font color="yellow">Why is she here, Hee-dong?</font>

93
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:20,024
<font color="yellow">I went to the orphanage
with grandfather to take pictures</font>

94
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:22,414
<font color="yellow">for the company newsletter when he saw Yoo-jin</font>

95
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,934
<font color="yellow">and remembered her as the daughter
of the woman who helped</font>

96
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,207
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae when she was in China.
So we brought her home.</font>

97
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:29,379
<font color="yellow">How can you bring her here?</font>

98
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:32,862
<font color="yellow">Who will watch her?</font>

99
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,488
<font color="yellow">Whatever!</font>

100
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,965
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, it's okay. She's a nice person.</font>

101
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,226
<font color="yellow">She's the daughter of the woman
who helped Shin-ae in China?</font>

102
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,496
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

103
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:55,629
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? You look so cute and smart!</font>

104
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,212
<font color="yellow">What's this? Did you guys
plan this behind my back?</font>

105
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,813
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? What did we plan?</font>

106
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:08,691
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yoon chose adult men's apparel.
Young-ju chose women's casual apparel.</font>

107
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,205
<font color="yellow">Min-cheol chose innerwear.
Mi-poong chose sportswear.</font>

108
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,197
<font color="yellow">I'm happy none of you concepts overlap.</font>

109
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:18,489
<font color="yellow">I was going to do innerwear
but changed at the end. I'm glad I did.</font>

110
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:23,609
<font color="yellow">I was going to do men's apparel, too.
I'm glad I didn't, or we would've overlapped.</font>

111
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:26,778
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

112
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:31,336
<font color="yellow">But why did you choose sportswear,
Mi-poong? It's a bit complicated.</font>

113
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:35,620
<font color="yellow">Well, although the weather grew colder,
people are interested in health,</font>

114
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:39,385
<font color="yellow">so many of them are
interested in playing sports.</font>

115
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,866
<font color="yellow">That's why it won't just be for strictly
sportswear but for everyday use, too.</font>

116
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:46,727
<font color="yellow">That's a good concept.</font>

117
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:50,786
<font color="yellow">Focusing on both functionality
and daily wear. Not bad at all.</font>

118
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,871
<font color="yellow">Really? I was worried.</font>

119

- Yes, ma'am!</font>

122
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,207
<font color="yellow">Oh, you chose that many?</font>

123
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,754
<font color="yellow">You should just look at the data.
That's what everyone else does.</font>

124
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,042
<font color="yellow">I thought I would be able to get good
ideas if I actually wear and touch them.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why do you need to come back in here?</font>

150
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:30,716
<font color="yellow">Is this how you seduced
my husband all this time?</font>

151
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:35,085
<font color="yellow">Ms. Ma, what are you talking about?</font>

152
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,241
<font color="yellow">I came to lock the gas.</font>

153
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,656
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare lie to me!</font>

154
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:45,753
<font color="yellow">You came in here knowing my husband
sleeps in his office by himself!</font>

155
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:47,611
<font color="yellow">You think I don't know that?</font>

156
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,921
<font color="yellow">Hey! Tell me if I'm wrong!</font>

157
00:11:55,211 --> 00:12:00,593
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you thrilled that my husband
left home and is now living here?</font>

158
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:04,890
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to respond
to such a ridiculous claim.</font>

159
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:08,065
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye.
- Where do you think you're going?</font>

160
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:14,648
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

161
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:24,115
<font color="yellow">Oh my god! Blood!</font>

162
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,945
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

163
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:42,477
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo!</font>

164
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:49,276
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, wake up!</font>

165
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,296
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo. Ms. Joo!</font>

166
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,790
<font color="yellow">Nothing will go wrong, right?</font>

167
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,051
<font color="yellow">She seemed to be bleeding a lot.</font>

168
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:27,382
<font color="yellow">What if she dies? No, that won't happen!</font>

169
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:36,241
<font color="yellow">If something happens to her,
Dal-ho will never want to see me again.</font>

170
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:37,898
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

171
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:14,563
<font color="yellow">She's gone. Thank goodness.</font>

172
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,108
<font color="yellow">She must have gone home.</font>

173
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,695
<font color="yellow">Yes. All I did was slightly push her.</font>

174
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,692
<font color="yellow">That fox-like wench.</font>

175
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:29,706
<font color="yellow">Did she fall down on purpose?</font>

176
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,070
<font color="yellow">That fox-like wench.</font>

177
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,031
<font color="yellow">It's cold!</font>

178
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,273
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold!</font>

179
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:47,726
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, spare me!</font>

180
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:53,562
<font color="yellow">Wow! This is the worst part-time job ever!
It's not even warm water!</font>

181
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:56,161
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, aren't you being too mean?</font>

182
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,412
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing as warm rain.</font>

183
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,522
<font color="yellow">This is the only way
I can figure out which type</font>

184
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:04,222
<font color="yellow">of clothing is a better barrier against rain.</font>

185
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:07,195
<font color="yellow">- This is what martyrs do.
- I know.</font>

186
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:09,940
<font color="yellow">Is the water soaking through the clothes?</font>

187
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,588
<font color="yellow">- Hold on.
- Hold on.</font>

188
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,945
<font color="yellow">- I don't think the water soaked through it yet.
- Mine, too!</font>

189
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:19,863
<font color="yellow">- Oh, really?
- Amazing.</font>

190
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:23,180
<font color="yellow">- Then Yoo-sung, do it one more time.
- Okay, aunt.</font>

191
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,539
<font color="yellow">It's so cold!</font>

192
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,460
<font color="yellow">What are you guys doing right now?</font>

193
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:34,249
<font color="yellow">It's the middle of winter, and
you guys are soaked! Are you crazy?</font>

194
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what are you doing?</font>

195
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:41,796
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- What are you doing with my sons right now?</font>

196
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:47,234
<font color="yellow">Mom, the thing is, Mi-poong is doing an
experiment with these work out clothes so that</font>

197
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,256
<font color="yellow">she can submit a proposal to the company.
If she does well, she can get a promotion.</font>

198
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:54,912
<font color="yellow">That's why Jang-soo
and I volunteered to help her.</font>

199
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:56,592
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong didn't make us do anything.</font>

200
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,805
<font color="yellow">That's right, mom! We volunteered!</font>

201
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,503
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous!</font>

202
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,156
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold!</font>

203
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:14,953
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I think I'll have
to go in first. Let go.</font>

204
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,788
<font color="yellow">- I'm freezing!
- How frustrating.</font>

205
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:23,461
<font color="yellow">Make sure you wipe this place dry!</font>

206
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,110
<font color="yellow">Are you going to take responsibility if
my mother-in-law slips and falls down here?</font>

207
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,289
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

208
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:34,313
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'll make sure to
wipe everything so that it's dry.</font>

209
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:43,305
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I like about you.</font>

210
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:48,718
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard I try
to like you, I just can't.</font>

211
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:04,835
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. She'll be happy
if you get a promotion.</font>

212
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,158
<font color="yellow">Don't you think she would be happy if</font>

213
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,281
<font color="yellow">her daughter-in-law is acknowledged
and gets a promotion?</font>

214
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:44,757
<font color="yellow">Are you awake?</font>

215
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:48,752
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

216
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:52,510
<font color="yellow">You were unconscious in the
restaurant with an injured wrist.</font>

217
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,964
<font color="yellow">What happened? Do you remember?</font>

218
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:05,333
<font color="yellow">The injury was bandaged, but since it was made</font>

219
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,939
<font color="yellow">by glass, there is a possibility of infection.</font>

220
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,513
<font color="yellow">Come back tomorrow to get it disinfected</font>

221
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,554
<font color="yellow">and make sure you take the
anti-inflammatory medication.</font>

222
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,001
<font color="yellow">Once the IV is empty, you may leave.</font>

223
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:16,914
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

224
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:26,742
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, once the IV is empty,</font>

225
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:31,437
<font color="yellow">I'll go home on my own, so you can go home.</font>

226
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,712
<font color="yellow">Come on, Ms. Joo.</font>

227
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,830
<font color="yellow">Would you go if you were in my shoes?</font>

228
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:42,364
<font color="yellow">The IV is almost empty, so I'll take you home.</font>

229
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,742
<font color="yellow">Please go.</font>

230
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:47,231
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

231
00:19:57,992 --> 00:20:02,367
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo. Ms. Joo, we need to talk.</font>

232
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:05,828
<font color="yellow">Talk about what?</font>

233
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:12,720
<font color="yellow">Is it my wife who did this to you?</font>

234
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:16,023
<font color="yellow">Ask her yourself.</font>

235
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:19,531
<font color="yellow">Did my wife really do this to you?</font>

236
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:23,937
<font color="yellow">Yes, she really did this to me.</font>

237
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,898
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

238
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:33,914
<font color="yellow">All I did was try to live my best.</font>

239
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:38,203
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?
It's not even just a couple of times.</font>

240
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:40,945
<font color="yellow">Why on earth is she doing this to me?</font>

241
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:45,094
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, please tell me.</font>

242
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,220
<font color="yellow">What happened to mom?</font>

243
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,257
<font color="yellow">She would've called me a long time ago.</font>

244
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,371
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to her?</font>

245
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,917
<font color="yellow">Mom, where are you right now?</font>

246
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:16,962
<font color="yellow">I called you, but you weren't answering.
Did something happen?</font>

247
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,060
<font color="yellow">Of course not. Were you worried about me?</font>

248
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,351
<font color="yellow">Of course I was.</font>

249
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,296
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened, and I'm home right now.</font>

250
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,480
<font color="yellow">I'll come to the front yard,
so bring Yoo-sung out.</font>

251
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:36,817
<font color="yellow">Mom, Yoo-sung is in dreamland right now.
I'll bring him to you tomorrow.</font>

252
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:41,734
<font color="yellow">Will that be okay? What if
your mother-in-law scolds him?</font>

253
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:44,791
<font color="yellow">She won't scold him.</font>

254
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:49,355
<font color="yellow">We had dinner together, and
she fried ham for him because he likes it.</font>

255
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:53,398
<font color="yellow">Really? I'm grateful.</font>

256
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,451
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't worry about Yoo-sung and
sleep well with the doors locked tightly.</font>

257
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,192
<font color="yellow">Rock-paper-scissors!</font>

258
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,710
<font color="yellow">I won!</font>

259
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:09,297
<font color="yellow">Ouch! It hurts!</font>

260
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:11,578
<font color="yellow">Let's do it again. That was unfair.</font>

261
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:16,118
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, do you know what time it is?
Why are you acting like a little kid?</font>

262
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,888
<font color="yellow">Look at my forehead! Do you know
how many times Yoo-jin hit me?</font>

263
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:22,972
<font color="yellow">I need to get my revenge.</font>

264
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,450
<font color="yellow">Are you going to stay up the whole night?</font>

265
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:29,860
<font color="yellow">Fine. Since it's late,
we'll play again tomorrow.</font>

266
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:34,156
<font color="yellow">I won't let you win tomorrow. Just watch.</font>

267
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:39,378
<font color="yellow">I'm not scared of you at all.</font>

268
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,195
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

269
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:48,845
<font color="yellow">But where will I sleep tonight?</font>

270
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

271
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,132
<font color="yellow">I'll let you sleep with Yoo-jin tonight.</font>

272
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:58,820
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, sleep here with Aunt Shin-ae tonight.</font>

273
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,266
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

274
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:03,789
<font color="yellow">Then good night, ladies.</font>

275
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:09,342
<font color="yellow">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

276
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,825
<font color="yellow">Thank you, God. Thank you so much.</font>

277
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,435
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, what are you wishing for?</font>

278
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,891
<font color="yellow">Aunt, God really exists.</font>

279
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:28,465
<font color="yellow">I always asked God to fulfill my wish.</font>

280
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:32,821
<font color="yellow">I was thanking God for fulfilling my wish.</font>

281
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,734
<font color="yellow">What wish did you ask for?</font>

282
00:25:36,922 --> 00:25:41,006
<font color="yellow">To be able to sleep with you at least once.</font>

283
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:43,961
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

284
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,714
<font color="yellow">I love your smell. I love this place, too.</font>

285
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:57,164
<font color="yellow">Mom, thank you.</font>

286
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:02,562
<font color="yellow">You're thanking me?</font>

287
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,445
<font color="yellow">You gave birth to me, and
you're letting me sleep with you.</font>

288
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:47,859
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

289
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:54,170
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- I have to ask you something. Please answer it.</font>

290
00:26:57,086 --> 00:26:58,086
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

291
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:02,812
<font color="yellow">Do you really love me?</font>

292
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,439
<font color="yellow">Did you wake me up to ask me that?</font>

293
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:11,606
<font color="yellow">Just answer my question.
Do you really love me?</font>

294
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,109
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

295
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:21,843
<font color="yellow">If you really love me, then get up right now.</font>

296
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:24,828
<font color="yellow">Why? What is it?</font>

297
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:29,761
<font color="yellow">If you really love me, prove it to me.</font>

298
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:34,087
<font color="yellow">Not with your words but with your body.</font>

299
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:35,844
<font color="yellow">With my body?</font>

300
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:44,242
<font color="yellow">But Yoo-sung is here.</font>

301
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:52,383
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

302
00:27:53,414 --> 00:27:56,438
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong,
I'm going to remember this forever!</font>

303
00:27:57,711 --> 00:28:00,402
<font color="yellow">What kind of woman uses her husband this way?</font>

304
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:03,708
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired I could die!</font>

305
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,226
<font color="yellow">Are you tired already?</font>

306
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:09,725
<font color="yellow">You said you loved me, but you're
complaining after just thirty minutes?</font>

307
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:14,027
<font color="yellow">So you only love me this much!</font>

308
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:17,624
<font color="yellow">What? "Just thirty minutes?"</font>

309
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:21,093
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see someone die
in "just thirty minutes?"</font>

310
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,664
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired!</font>

311
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:25,937
<font color="yellow">Is your t-shirt wet with sweat?</font>

312
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:27,991
<font color="yellow">Can't you see me sweating right now?</font>

313
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:30,726
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

314
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,534
<font color="yellow">My t-shirt isn't wet yet.</font>

315
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,242
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

316
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,912
<font color="yellow">Then run around the playground ten times.</font>

317
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:47,716
<font color="yellow">What? Ten times?</font>

318
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,750
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm so dizzy!</font>

319
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:58,633
<font color="yellow">Ten times?</font>

320
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,860
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

321
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:04,062
<font color="yellow">I need exact function data
about how well this clothes</font>

322
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,657
<font color="yellow">soaks up your sweat and
how well the ventilation is.</font>

323
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,510
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and run!</font>

324
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:12,683
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting mad at me?</font>

325
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,066
<font color="yellow">I'll run.</font>

326
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:17,261
<font color="yellow">Ten times?</font>

327
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:23,954
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, get out of the way.</font>

328
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:32,099
<font color="yellow">Go! Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!</font>

329
00:29:32,124 --> 00:29:36,184
<font color="yellow">- I'm so tired!
- Hurry up!</font>

330
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:42,441
<font color="yellow">- Go! Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry!
- I'm so tired! I can't do this anymore!</font>

331
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,335
<font color="yellow">Hurry up! You said you loved me!</font>

332
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,493
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die.</font>

333
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:52,665
<font color="yellow">- Screw this!
- Jang-go!</font>

334
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:00,852
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, eat a lot of mushrooms.</font>

335
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,932
<font color="yellow">I will. You eat a lot, too.</font>

336
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:09,440
<font color="yellow">By the way, if you want
to live a long, healthy life...</font>

337
00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:13,622
<font color="yellow">you need to eat this, too.</font>

338
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,369
<font color="yellow">Really? Thank you.</font>

339
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:23,140
<font color="yellow">You must be happy to finally
meet your granddaughter.</font>

340
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,341
<font color="yellow">It was like she dropped from the sky.</font>

341
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:34,803
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm thankful for each and every day.</font>

342
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:39,409
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mr. Kim, have some balloon flowers, too.</font>

343
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:45,036
<font color="yellow">By the way, what happened
to the person who tricked others</font>

344
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:49,585
<font color="yellow">by saying balloons
flowers were wild ginseng?</font>

345
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:53,917
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

346
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:57,163
<font color="yellow">It's the fault of the person
who was tricked into believing</font>

347
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,609
<font color="yellow">balloon flowers were
wild ginseng in the first place.</font>

348
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:04,061
<font color="yellow">She just seemed quite desperate
to do that, so I just ignored it.</font>

349
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,055
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you really going to do this?</font>

350
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,995
<font color="yellow">Can't you shut your mouth?</font>

351
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,135
<font color="yellow">Is Yoo-jin still asleep?</font>

352
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:18,794
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather. She must have been
tired from playing with me until late last night.</font>

353
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,420
<font color="yellow">Be good to her before she leaves today.</font>

354
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:23,987
<font color="yellow">Grandfather. Mom. Grandma.</font>

355
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:27,799
<font color="yellow">I want Yoo-jin to stay here for a
few more days. Would that be all right?</font>

356
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:30,091
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae said she was okay with it.</font>

357
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:32,245
<font color="yellow">Sure, go ahead.</font>

358
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,653
<font color="yellow">Thank you, grandfather.</font>

359
00:31:35,784 --> 00:31:39,471
<font color="yellow">But why don't I see Dal-ho at home nowadays?</font>

360
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,354
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something happen?</font>

361
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:48,979
<font color="yellow">What is it? Chung-ja, you tell me.</font>

362
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,502
<font color="yellow">Yes, well...</font>

363
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:54,674
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

364
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:59,251
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho isn't coming home lately.</font>

365
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:01,229
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

366
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,297
<font color="yellow">What do you mean he isn't coming home lately?</font>

367
00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:10,346
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

368
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,731
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you're living in the office?</font>

369
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,454
<font color="yellow">Why would you live there when you have a home?</font>

370
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:22,614
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.</font>

371
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:24,081
<font color="yellow">But I...</font>

372
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,707
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll be able
to come home for a while.</font>

373
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,613
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

374
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,448
<font color="yellow">Why can't you come home?</font>

375
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:38,229
<font color="yellow">It's going to be difficult
to live with my wife.</font>

376
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:43,565
<font color="yellow">What? You can't live with Chung-ja? Why not?</font>

377
00:32:44,472 --> 00:32:45,999
<font color="yellow">There should be a reason.</font>

378
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:50,670
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, this is my fault! I'm sorry!</font>

379
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:56,612
<font color="yellow">So please don't say that you
can't live with Chung-ja!</font>

380
00:32:57,065 --> 00:33:01,932
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Why is this your fault?</font>

381
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:05,315
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what's going on.</font>

382
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:09,092
<font color="yellow">What on earth happened
for Dal-ho to act like this?</font>

383
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:13,327
<font color="yellow">The truth is, Chung-ja...</font>

384
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:17,760
<font color="yellow">- She has delusional suspicion of his faithfulness.
- What?</font>

385
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,096
<font color="yellow">Delusional suspicion?</font>

386
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:25,818
<font color="yellow">It's not anything severe.
It's just in the early stages.</font>

387
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,331
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

388
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:29,776
<font color="yellow">What on earth?</font>

389
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:35,349
<font color="yellow">That's why Chung-ja misunderstood
Dal-ho as being unfaithful to her.</font>

390
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:37,511
<font color="yellow">She bothered him quite a bit.</font>

391
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,671
<font color="yellow">So please understand. She has an illness.</font>

392
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:46,882
<font color="yellow">She's taking medication and getting
treatment for it, so please understand her.</font>

393
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,050
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

394
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,826
<font color="yellow">How can this happen?</font>

395
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:57,687
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, I didn't know that, and
I had the wrong idea about you.</font>

396
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:03,575
<font color="yellow">It was wrong of me to go to the
noodle restaurant and do that.</font>

397
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:06,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was wrong.</font>

398
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,353
<font color="yellow">What did you do at the noodle restaurant?</font>

399
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,424
<font color="yellow">Please understand even if I don't
come home for the time being.</font>

400
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:19,573
<font color="yellow">And I will do my job, so you don't
have to worry about that.</font>

401
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:22,682
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, I'm sorry.</font>

402
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:26,777
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho! Mr. Kim! Dal-ho!</font>

403
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:31,246
<font color="yellow">- Dal-ho.
- Honey.</font>

404
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:34,273
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the bedroom and talk.</font>

405
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:39,548
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you, and
I don't want to hear anything from you.</font>

406
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:43,863
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!</font>

407
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,313
<font color="yellow">If you say sorry, do you think you can
be forgiven for all that you've done?</font>

408
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:52,717
<font color="yellow">I love you so much. That's why I did that.</font>

409
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,080
<font color="yellow">So please understand me.</font>

410
00:34:56,182 --> 00:35:01,994
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the hospital, taking
my medication, and getting treatment.</font>

411
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,517
<font color="yellow">That will never happen again. So, honey...</font>

412
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:08,278
<font color="yellow">Is that why you did that last night?</font>

413
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,870
<font color="yellow">Because you took your medication
and went to the hospital?</font>

414
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:12,698
<font color="yellow">Last night?</font>

415
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:15,477
<font color="yellow">You hurt someone and ran away
because you have an illness?</font>

416
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:18,061
<font color="yellow">Can you do such a thing
because you have an illness?</font>

417
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:23,588
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you, so don't
call me and don't come to the store.</font>

418
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:24,613
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

419
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:27,438
<font color="yellow">- Dal-ho!
- Honey!</font>

420
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:29,267
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja!
- Honey!</font>

421
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:33,158
<font color="yellow">What did you do this time?</font>

422
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:39,520
<font color="yellow">Last night, I went to the noodle restaurant
and saw that the wench was there alone.</font>

423
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:45,860
<font color="yellow">I just gave her a little push, and
she fell over. What was I supposed to do?</font>

424
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,877
<font color="yellow">Oh my god, Chung-ja! What's wrong with you?</font>

425
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:52,650
<font color="yellow">- Get a hold of yourself!
- Mom, look at what he just did.</font>

426
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:57,223
<font color="yellow">How did he know that she fell and got hurt?</font>

427
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,206
<font color="yellow">He knows because they contacted each other!</font>

428
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:03,767
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, do you want to get
admitted into a mental institution?</font>

429
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:07,763
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho left because
you're continuing to be like this!</font>

430
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:11,595
<font color="yellow">Mom, do I really have delusional
suspicion of my husband's faithfulness?</font>

431
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,426
<font color="yellow">I'm imaging things that didn't even happen.</font>

432
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:19,565
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. How on earth did my daughter
end up with such a tragic illness?</font>

433
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,816
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

434
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:27,150
<font color="yellow">Mom, what do I do?</font>

435
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:33,080
<font color="yellow">Mom, what if I get divorced?</font>

436
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:36,518
<font color="yellow">How did you injure your hand?</font>

437
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:38,929
<font color="yellow">I got into an accident while working at home.</font>

438
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:41,768
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

439
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:46,601
<font color="yellow">If you don't work, you'll run out of
money quickly. What are you going to do?</font>

440
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:50,168
<font color="yellow">We'll do your share of the work until you</font>

441
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:53,174
<font color="yellow">- get better, so just come out.

444
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:01,448
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

445
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,433
<font color="yellow">It seems like there's
something you can't tell us.</font>

<font color="yellow">Come visit us sometimes.</font>

447
00:37:07,807 --> 00:37:09,604
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

we get misunderstood again?</font>

543
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,627

came out because, like you said,</font>

544
00:44:07,652 --> 00:44:10,696
<font color="yellow">it was rude of me to quit without
you hiring another employee first.</font>

<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, let's have a sincere talk.</font>

551
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:42,708
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to quit?</font>

552
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:47,842
<font color="yellow">Why else? Because I don't like you.</font>

553
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,848
<font color="yellow">You dislike me? Me?</font>

554
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:52,051
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

555
00:44:53,981 --> 00:44:58,520
<font color="yellow">I'm bewildered because I've never met
someone recently who didn't like me before.</font>

556
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:01,578
<font color="yellow">You're pretty full of yourself.</font>

557
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:04,731
<font color="yellow">To be honest, you're a bit weird.</font>

558
00:45:05,187 --> 00:45:06,587
<font color="yellow">You should know that.</font>

559
00:45:07,147 --> 00:45:10,548
<font color="yellow">I thought I treated you
with manners all this time.</font>

560
00:45:11,437 --> 00:45:13,382
<font color="yellow">I even gave you a bonus last time.</font>

561
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:16,507
<font color="yellow">How can you attack me like this?</font>

562
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:18,694
<font color="yellow">I'm very hurt.</font>

563
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:22,140
<font color="yellow">So you're saying I'm weird, right?</font>

564
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:24,443
<font color="yellow">Is that why you dislike me?</font>

565
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:27,501
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying you're very weird.</font>

566
00:45:28,296 --> 00:45:30,413
<font color="yellow">You just don't know a woman's feelings.</font>

567
00:45:30,438 --> 00:45:34,663
<font color="yellow">Fine. If you dislike me
so much, you should quit.</font>

568
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,653
<font color="yellow">I'll hire another employee right away.</font>

569
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:40,891
<font color="yellow">Until then, I hope you can bear with me.</font>

570
00:45:44,757 --> 00:45:46,765
<font color="yellow">This wasn't supposed to happen. What do I do?</font>

571
00:45:46,968 --> 00:45:48,560
<font color="yellow">Should I confess right now?</font>

572
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:54,307
<font color="yellow">But why didn't you give Ms. Hwang
the gift I told you to give her?</font>

573
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:56,461
<font color="yellow">Did you pocket it?</font>

574
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:00,063
<font color="yellow">That's not it...</font>

575
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:04,205
<font color="yellow">- I didn't know you were such a dull person.
- A dull person?</font>

576
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:08,632
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me to give that to her?</font>

577
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:14,254
<font color="yellow">I was trying to hold this in, but I can't
anymore! Do you like my sister-in-law?</font>

578
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

579
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:39,444
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for dragging you here.</font>

580
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,562
<font color="yellow">But I really wanted to talk to you,
and I felt like I had to...</font>

581
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:52,710
<font color="yellow">I know you feel apologetic towards me.</font>

582
00:46:54,726 --> 00:47:00,257
<font color="yellow">And I know you'll feel guilty
that I'm quitting work like this.</font>

583
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:05,343
<font color="yellow">And that's why you brought me here.</font>

584
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:10,437
<font color="yellow">But I'm fine.</font>

585
00:47:11,187 --> 00:47:19,107
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm quitting without any
resentment, so don't feel guilty anymore.</font>

586
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:20,810
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

587
00:47:21,553 --> 00:47:23,820
<font color="yellow">I do feel very guilty towards you.</font>

588
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:28,221
<font color="yellow">So on the way here,
I was thinking about telling you</font>

589
00:47:29,706 --> 00:47:31,984
<font color="yellow">how sorry I am and that
I'm hoping you won't quit.</font>

590
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:35,537
<font color="yellow">I thought I had brought you
here to say those things to you.</font>

591
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:36,865
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

592
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:40,614
<font color="yellow">While I was bringing you here...</font>

593
00:47:42,802 --> 00:47:45,169
<font color="yellow">I realized that's not all
I wanted to say to you.</font>

594
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:52,982
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, what are you talking about?</font>

595
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,013
<font color="yellow">When you were leaving the store earlier...</font>

596
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,898
<font color="yellow">I couldn't send you away like that.</font>

597
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:10,386
<font color="yellow">I felt like I shouldn't just
let you leave like this.</font>

598
00:48:12,482 --> 00:48:17,244
<font color="yellow">I was going to bury these
feelings within me until I die.</font>

599
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:20,670
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, what are you trying to say?</font>

600
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:26,893
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take the bus home.</font>

601
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,021
<font color="yellow">I think that would be best.</font>

602
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,373
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo.</font>

603
00:48:32,592 --> 00:48:34,537
<font color="yellow">I know it's shameless of me to ask you this,</font>

604
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,325
<font color="yellow">but can't you come back out to the restaurant?</font>

605
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:42,072
<font color="yellow">Aside from everything else,
I'd like to repay my debt to you.</font>

606
00:48:43,498 --> 00:48:46,655
<font color="yellow">You're not indebted to me.</font>

607
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:52,644
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the kindness
you showed my family and me.</font>

608
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:55,733
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

609
00:48:57,404 --> 00:48:59,837
<font color="yellow">Then go home safely.</font>

610
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:12,867
<font color="yellow"><i>I am erasing you, I need to forget you now</i></font>

611
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:20,274
<font color="yellow"><i>You spread through my fingers, it hurts</i></font>

612
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:26,447
<font color="yellow"><i>What do I do?</i></font>

613
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:33,488
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you someone I can't forget?</i></font>

614
00:49:33,488 --> 00:49:40,528
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you someone I can't erase?</i></font>

615
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:54,342
<font color="yellow"><i>While I live, will there be a day without you?</i></font>

616
00:49:54,342 --> 00:50:01,115
<font color="yellow"><i>Is it too late for you to come back?</i></font>

617
00:50:01,115 --> 00:50:12,627
<font color="yellow"><i>I love you, I can't erase these words</i></font>

618
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:18,972
<font color="yellow">Oh, all right! All right!
I'm on my way right now!</font>

619
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:20,428
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, mom.</font>

620
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:25,270
<font color="yellow">I promised Mi-poong I would pick up
Yoo-sung today, but I'm not done with work yet.</font>

621
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:30,008
<font color="yellow">Mom, you can't scold Mi-poong for this, okay?</font>

622
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:31,467
<font color="yellow">Hang up!</font>

623
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:33,224
<font color="yellow">How frustrating!</font>

624
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,488
<font color="yellow">Where did mother go today?</font>

625
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:41,353
<font color="yellow">What on earth is that woman doing? How can she</font>

626
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:43,613
<font color="yellow">let her grandson be cared for by someone else?</font>

627
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:45,084
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

628
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:49,978
<font color="yellow">- Let's go home.
- I don't want to say good-bye to Yoo-sung.</font>

629
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:54,541
<font color="yellow">- Can't I play with him a little longer?
- I want to play with her, too.</font>

630
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:58,227
<font color="yellow">But the school is closed,
so we have to go home.</font>

631
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:00,419
<font color="yellow">How about you guys play tomorrow?</font>

632
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:02,643
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

633
00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:08,454
<font color="yellow">Can't we play at your house?</font>

634
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:12,481
<font color="yellow">I want to play with
Yoo-jin at your house, too.</font>

635
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:14,576
<font color="yellow">What's your name again? Yoo-sung?</font>

636
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,513
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm Kim Yoo-sung.</font>

637
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:21,875
<font color="yellow">If you want to play at my house,
you have to get permission from your mom.</font>

638
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,574
<font color="yellow">I don't have a mom.</font>

639
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,995
<font color="yellow">I only have a grandma and an aunt.</font>

640
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:27,889
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

641
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:29,014
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung!</font>

642
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:34,492
<font color="yellow">Let's go! Your grandma and aunt
are busy today, so I came instead.</font>

643
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,068
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Oh, you're Chung-ja's son.</font>

644
00:51:39,677 --> 00:51:41,185
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms. Hwang. Hello.</font>

645
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:44,388
<font color="yellow">Hi. But what brings you here?</font>

646
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:47,951
<font color="yellow">This little girl is staying at our house.</font>

647
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:50,906
<font color="yellow">But she wants to play with Yoo-sung.</font>

648
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:54,456
<font color="yellow">Can he play at my house?
I'll take him home later.</font>

649
00:51:55,186 --> 00:52:01,471
<font color="yellow">Of course he can. All right. You can
take him. Just bring him home safely later.</font>

650
00:52:02,178 --> 00:52:03,268
<font color="yellow">I will. Thank you.</font>

651
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:05,515
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and play, Yoo-sung.</font>

652
00:52:05,677 --> 00:52:06,677
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

653
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:12,261
<font color="yellow">That's good. I won't have
to bother with him anymore.</font>

654
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:16,545
<font color="yellow">But why is Chung-ja so late? She said she was</font>

655
00:52:16,571 --> 00:52:18,529
<font color="yellow">hungry and told us to order a bunch of food.</font>

656
00:52:18,755 --> 00:52:22,518
<font color="yellow">They say women with delusional
suspicion can suddenly go mad.</font>

657
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:26,152
<font color="yellow">What if she forgot her plans with us
and is stalking her husband right now?</font>

658
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:28,560
<font color="yellow">Does she really want to do that at her age?</font>

659
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:31,312
<font color="yellow">I want to throw my husband away.</font>

660
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:32,802
<font color="yellow">I know!</font>

661
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:36,185
<font color="yellow">Hi! I'm here!</font>

662
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:40,348
<font color="yellow">I'm late, aren't I? There was so much traffic!</font>

663
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,525
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there something on my face?</font>

664
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:46,298
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

665
00:52:46,822 --> 00:52:50,567
<font color="yellow">You said you were hungry.
Eat up. Have some meat, too.</font>

666
00:52:50,592 --> 00:52:51,592
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

667
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:56,244
<font color="yellow">They say that your body has to be
healthy for your mind to be healthy.</font>

668
00:52:56,269 --> 00:52:59,728
<font color="yellow">At our age, health is more
important than money!</font>

669
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:02,900
<font color="yellow">Come on! That's an old joke!</font>

670
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:06,572
<font color="yellow">The barbecued beef here is good.</font>

671
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:09,867
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, have some potato pancakes.</font>

672
00:53:10,174 --> 00:53:13,507
<font color="yellow">Someone said that these
are good for your illness.</font>

673
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:16,258
<font color="yellow">What illness?</font>

674
00:53:16,283 --> 00:53:19,410
<font color="yellow">If you eat well and relax, you can fix it.</font>

675
00:53:19,435 --> 00:53:22,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you so obsessed
with your husband at that age?</font>

676
00:53:22,105 --> 00:53:24,952
<font color="yellow">You should just meet up with us and have fun!</font>

677
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:30,384
<font color="yellow">You guys heard something
from Geum-sil, didn't you?</font>

678
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:32,625
<font color="yellow">Who cares where we heard it from?</font>

679
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,487
<font color="yellow">The important thing is that
you need to cure your illness.</font>

680
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:38,830
<font color="yellow">And you shouldn't hide your illness.
What are friends for?</font>

681
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:44,418
<font color="yellow">It's times like these that you should get
some fresh air and meet up with us.</font>

682
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:47,978
<font color="yellow">Or else, your delusional suspicion of
your husband's faithfulness will worsen.</font>

683
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:51,582
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be embarrassed at all.
You have a good illness.</font>

684
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,770
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil and I are widows,
so we can't even get such an illness.</font>

685
00:53:57,127 --> 00:54:02,775
<font color="yellow">Are you guys happy that I have delusional
suspicion of my husband's faithfulness?</font>

686
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,736
<font color="yellow">- You brats.
- Chung-ja.</font>

687
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hwang Geum-sil! Come out here!</font>

688
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:14,337
<font color="yellow">- Come out!
- That sounds like Chung-ja.</font>

689
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:15,955
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

690
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,203
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?
Are you really my friend?</font>

691
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,955
<font color="yellow">I trusted you!</font>

692
00:54:25,213 --> 00:54:29,654
<font color="yellow">How can you tell everyone I have delusional
suspicion of my husband's faithfulness?</font>

693
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:34,939
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, Young-soon was
there at the movie theater, too.</font>

694
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:39,716
<font color="yellow">She was so worried about you.
That's why I told her. Is that so wrong?</font>

695
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:43,353
<font color="yellow">And who cares if they know?
They're our friends.</font>

696
00:54:43,494 --> 00:54:47,170
<font color="yellow">Is that why they're laughing at me?</font>

697
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,465
<font color="yellow">Come on, Chung-ja. Who did that?
No one would do such a thing!</font>

698
00:54:50,572 --> 00:54:54,002
<font color="yellow">I became like this
because of you and Young-soon!</font>

699
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,361
<font color="yellow">If you two hadn't told me
about the movie theater incident,</font>

700
00:54:57,983 --> 00:55:00,340
<font color="yellow">then I wouldn't have such a terrible illness!</font>

701
00:55:00,962 --> 00:55:03,384
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, sit down.</font>

702
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:13,442
<font color="yellow">To be honest, compared to other women, you've</font>

703
00:55:13,864 --> 00:55:16,947
<font color="yellow">always been obsessive about your husband.</font>

704
00:55:17,502 --> 00:55:20,317
<font color="yellow">You have a maid at home,
and yet, you missed out on</font>

705
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:23,372
<font color="yellow">several of our meetings
because you had to cook for him.</font>

706
00:55:23,557 --> 00:55:26,595
<font color="yellow">How can I come out when
my husband is home all alone?</font>

707
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:30,041
<font color="yellow">You probably don't know
because you don't have a husband,</font>

708
00:55:30,572 --> 00:55:34,047
<font color="yellow">but you're not supposed to leave
your husband alone in the house with a maid!</font>

709
00:55:35,814 --> 00:55:39,822
<font color="yellow">See? Ever since then, you were in the
early stages of your delusional suspicion.</font>

710
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,400
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, Chung-ja.</font>

711
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:45,270
<font color="yellow">Anyways, you'll be able
to cure that illness if you just</font>

712
00:55:45,295 --> 00:55:48,802
<font color="yellow">take your medication,
so relax and think positively.</font>

713
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:54,257
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, do I really have delusional
suspicion of my husband's faithfulness?</font>

714
00:55:54,432 --> 00:55:57,719
<font color="yellow">Yes, you do. Oh my goodness, Chung-ja.</font>

715
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:01,534
<font color="yellow">Everyone has been saying I have delusional</font>

716
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:04,267
<font color="yellow">suspicion, so I feel like I really do have it.</font>

717
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:05,757
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

718
00:56:06,268 --> 00:56:09,596
<font color="yellow">What will I do if I can't cure this illness?</font>

719
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:12,365
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, don't cry.</font>

720
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:15,556
<font color="yellow">My heart is starting to break.</font>

721
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:23,291
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, last night, I thought my husband
and that wench was together,</font>

722
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:28,124
<font color="yellow">so I went to the noodle restaurant
and made an accident.</font>

723
00:56:28,979 --> 00:56:30,760
<font color="yellow">An accident? What accident?</font>

724
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:34,476
<font color="yellow">I was spying on the noodle restaurant outside</font>

725
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:38,810
<font color="yellow">when your in-law came out
with all the employees but</font>

726
00:56:38,835 --> 00:56:42,409
<font color="yellow">sent them away and went back
into the restaurant by herself.</font>

727
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:44,565
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

728
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,635
<font color="yellow">That's why I barged in there.</font>

729
00:56:47,228 --> 00:56:52,283
<font color="yellow">She said she came to lock up the
gas valve, but would I believe her?</font>

730
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,519
<font color="yellow">So I accused her of coming
to seduce my husband</font>

731
00:56:56,544 --> 00:56:59,874
<font color="yellow">and just slightly pushed her on accident.</font>

732
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:05,912
<font color="yellow">She was too weak and fell right over.
She injured her wrist on a glass rod.</font>

733
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:11,230
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm about to get divorced.
What will I do?</font>

734
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:15,881
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I told you not to doubt him.
I told you to believe him.</font>

735
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:21,997
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, you didn't take the
medication the hospital gave you, huh?</font>

736
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,455
<font color="yellow">I forgot to take it yesterday and today.</font>

737
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,745
<font color="yellow">See! You should have taken your medication!</font>

738
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:35,672
<font color="yellow">Mother! Nam-yi! When did you come home?</font>

739
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,120
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

740
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:44,837
<font color="yellow">I overheard you have delusional
suspicion of your husband's faithfulness.</font>

741
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:47,706
<font color="yellow">How did you get such a terrible illness?</font>

742
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:52,036
<font color="yellow">- I'll be going now. Bye.
- Bye, Chung-ja.</font>

743
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:55,245
<font color="yellow">Go home safely.</font>

744
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:00,128
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, was she talking
about Mi-poong's mom?</font>

745
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:02,659
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

746
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:04,808
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

747
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,152
<font color="yellow">I saw Mi-poong's mom this morning,
and she had a bandage around her wrist.</font>

748
00:58:09,855 --> 00:58:15,580
<font color="yellow">Then she hurt Ms. Joo's hand due to of
her suspicion of her husband's faithfulness?</font>

749
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:16,964
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

750
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,073
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

751
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:22,281
<font color="yellow">It must be sad to live
all by herself. On top of that,</font>

752
00:58:22,306 --> 00:58:24,605
<font color="yellow">she got misunderstood
and had her hand injured.</font>

753
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:27,339
<font color="yellow">How heartbroken she must be.</font>

754
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,520
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin. Yoo-sung. I'm going to be upstairs,</font>

755
00:58:42,545 --> 00:58:45,104
<font color="yellow">so if you need anything, come see me. Okay?</font>

756
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:46,129
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

757
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,691
<font color="yellow">- Please make snacks for them.
- Sure.</font>

758
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:57,687
<font color="yellow">Kids, I'll give you your snacks soon,
so wait here and play for a little bit.</font>

759
00:58:57,816 --> 00:58:58,816
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

760
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:02,479
<font color="yellow">It's so nice to have kids around the house.</font>

761
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:08,210
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, do you want to play hide-and-seek?</font>

762
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:12,448
<font color="yellow">Sure. You can hide first.</font>

763
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

764
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:20,964
<font color="yellow">Come out come out wherever you are.</font>

765
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:22,762
<font color="yellow">Ready or not, here I come.</font>

766
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,863
<font color="yellow">Did you see Yoo-jin?</font>

767
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:33,604
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. I don't know where she is.</font>

768
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:39,933
<font color="yellow">Got you!</font>

769
00:59:40,316 --> 00:59:42,190
<font color="yellow">It's my turn to hide now.</font>

770
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:43,519
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

771
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:51,901
<font color="yellow">Come out come out wherever you are.</font>

772
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:19,393
<font color="yellow">I found you, Yoo-sung!</font>

773
01:00:23,238 --> 01:00:25,018
<font color="yellow">What are you staring at?</font>

774
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:29,066
<font color="yellow">This ring looks exactly
like my grandma's ring.</font>

775
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:36,440
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's pretty. It's a wedding ring.</font>

776
01:00:48,362 --> 01:00:50,229
<font color="yellow">Honey, is the baby sleeping?</font>

777
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,839
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's sleeping, honey.</font>

778
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:54,956
<font color="yellow">Honey, are you hungry?</font>

779
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,862
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm hungry. Hurry up
and give me food, honey.</font>

780
01:00:58,433 --> 01:01:01,300
<font color="yellow">Okay, honey. Come here and eat some snacks.</font>

781
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,323
<font color="yellow">Be careful, honey.</font>

782
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,292
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

783
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:24,950
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,
Yoo-jin had a fun time. Thank you.</font>

784
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:27,495
<font color="yellow">I had a relaxed time, thanks to you.</font>

785
01:01:28,948 --> 01:01:31,214
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Yoo-sung.
- Bye.</font>

786
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,573
<font color="yellow">- Go home safely.
- I will.</font>

787
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:39,328
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, let's go to your house and
leave your backpack and jacket there.</font>

788
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:42,214
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I can do it by myself.</font>

789
01:01:42,581 --> 01:01:46,214
<font color="yellow">Really? Then change your clothes and
come back so that we can have dinner.</font>

790
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:47,316
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

791
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:55,440
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-jin.
- Aunt!</font>

792
01:01:59,441 --> 01:02:03,854
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Did you have a good day?</font>

793
01:02:07,284 --> 01:02:10,675
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this ring from?</font>

794
01:02:11,386 --> 01:02:13,135
<font color="yellow">From Mr. Kim's room.</font>

795
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:17,418
<font color="yellow">Why would you play with this?
You're not supposed to play with it! Got it?</font>

796
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:19,292
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

797
01:02:31,941 --> 01:02:35,393
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, where's the other ring?</font>

798
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,760
<font color="yellow">I gave it to Yoo-sung.</font>

799
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,300
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

800
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:43,778
<font color="yellow">You gave it to who?</font>

801
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:46,617
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung? Which Yoo-sung?</font>

802
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,675
<font color="yellow">I only know one Yoo-sung.</font>

803
01:02:52,003 --> 01:02:56,496
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying you gave
the ring to Yoo-sung, the little boy</font>

804
01:02:56,521 --> 01:03:01,013
<font color="yellow">who lived in that house that you
visited with Soon-boon last time?</font>

805
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:07,089
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see me die?</font>

806
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:23,573
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

807

<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth! Where is the ring?</font>

809
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:53,384
<font color="yellow">- Will the police take me if I steal something?
- Of course.</font>

810
01:03:53,409 --> 01:03:56,450
<font color="yellow">- I asked if you like her.
- Yes, I do like her.</font>
