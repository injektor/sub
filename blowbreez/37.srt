00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:09,061
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm the one who put up the ad in the newspaper.</font>

3
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,563
<font color="yellow">You know Kim Soon-ok?</font>

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,729
<font color="yellow">Did he call because of the newspaper?</font>

5
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,235
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,237
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand. I'll go there right away. Bye.</font>

7
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,563
<font color="yellow">Did he really call because of the ad in the newspaper?</font>

8
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:32,354
<font color="yellow">- Does he know your grandmother Kim Soon-ok? - Yes, mom!</font>

9
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:35,242
<font color="yellow">He wants to meet us right away.</font>

10
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:36,704
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

11
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:41,320
<font color="yellow">Try calling him.</font>

12
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:49,142
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

13
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,765
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're here already.</font>

14
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,815
<font color="yellow">You arrived at the cafe right now?</font>

15
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:00,532
<font color="yellow">Is that him?</font>

16
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,380
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

17
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,476
<font color="yellow">Did you say your hometown was Pyeongyang?</font>

18
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,086
<font color="yellow">Yes. What about you?</font>

19
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:17,813
<font color="yellow">My hometown is Wonsan.</font>

20
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:20,469
<font color="yellow">Wonsan?</font>

21
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:25,903
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok and I had two daughters. Do you know...?</font>

22
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:31,707
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law doesn't have any daughters.</font>

23
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:36,055
<font color="yellow">She only has one son named Kim Dae-hoon, who is my husband.</font>

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

25
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:41,367
<font color="yellow">Then she must not be the Kim Soon-ok I'm looking for.</font>

26
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:47,368
<font color="yellow">Our hometowns and family relations are different.</font>

27
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,751
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

28
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:53,490
<font color="yellow">Then do you know this ring?</font>

29
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:56,287
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law used to wear this.</font>

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,995
<font color="yellow">No. This isn't it.</font>

31
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,610
<font color="yellow">My wife's ring was bigger.</font>

32
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,242
<font color="yellow">I was hoping you would be the one I was looking for.</font>

33
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,004
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for asking to meet up with you.</font>

34
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,820
<font color="yellow">It's all right, sir.</font>

35
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:22,609
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll find your family.</font>

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,687
<font color="yellow">Yes. If they're alive, I'll meet them one day.</font>

37
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:32,307
<font color="yellow">I hope you two will find your grandfather.</font>

38
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,172
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

<font color="yellow">Geum-sil! Hwang Geum-sil!</font>

40
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,463
<font color="yellow">I'm here! Hurry up and come out!</font>

41
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:47,805
<font color="yellow">Okay! Hold on!</font>

42
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:50,206
<font color="yellow">Why didn't she get ready sooner?</font>

43
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,043
<font color="yellow">They really moved away.</font>

44
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,010
<font color="yellow">I feel so much better now.</font>

45
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:09,503
<font color="yellow">They left this house, and she was kicked out of the company, too.</font>

46
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,008
<font color="yellow">I won't have to deal with this family anymore, right?</font>

47
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,846
<font color="yellow">Look how messy it is.</font>

48
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,322
<font color="yellow">What are you muttering about while looking at an empty house?</font>

49
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,908
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

50
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,699
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to rent this house out to anyone?</font>

51
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,632
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law told me not to.</font>

52
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,845
<font color="yellow">Why not? It's not good to have an empty house</font>

53
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,706
<font color="yellow">for a long time. Hurry up and rent it out.</font>

54
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,908
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I know that? I need to make money, too.</font>

55
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:38,530
<font color="yellow">Your mother-in-law isn't going to bring that woman back in here, is she?</font>

56
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,322
<font color="yellow">Goodness. How would I know?</font>

57
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:44,940
<font color="yellow">That can never happen! Never!</font>

58
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:48,022
<font color="yellow">Of course not! That wouldn't make any sense!</font>

59
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:51,150
<font color="yellow">Why would we bring back the mother of my ex-daughter-in-law?</font>

60
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:54,994
<font color="yellow">I'd rather break this house apart.</font>

61
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,385
<font color="yellow">You wicked thing!</font>

62
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,087
<font color="yellow">Just look at the way you speak.</font>

63
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,901
<font color="yellow">Who are you to break my house apart?</font>

64
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,191
<font color="yellow">Mother, it was just a joke!</font>

65
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,142
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja, let's go. - Good-bye.</font>

66
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:16,862
<font color="yellow">You're living the good life after your son got a divorce, huh?</font>

67
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,619
<font color="yellow">You evil wench!</font>

68
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,824
<font color="yellow">Hurry back home and make grilled wheat cake!</font>

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,526
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go.</font>

70
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:23,815
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

71
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:34,473
<font color="yellow">She broke her son's heart, but she's all happy and dressed up nicely.</font>

72
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:36,596
<font color="yellow">Goodness! That awful wench!</font>

73
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:38,910
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get away with this.</font>

74
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,479
<font color="yellow">Hello. Hello.</font>

75
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,627
<font color="yellow">Hello. I hope you're having a good day.</font>

76
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:48,885
<font color="yellow">You came again.</font>

77
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,166
<font color="yellow">I was curious if the video file was restored yet.</font>

78
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:56,229
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to tell you that it's going to be difficult to restore that?</font>

79
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,540
<font color="yellow">Then may I have the copies of the videos from a</font>

80
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:04,694
<font color="yellow">week before the incident to the day it happened?</font>

81
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:11,157
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're thirsty, aren't you? Please drink this.</font>

82
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:17,096
<font color="yellow">May I please have them?</font>

83
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:21,162
<font color="yellow">Sure. Hold on.</font>

84
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

85
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:30,807
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

86
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:42,535
<font color="yellow">- About the video file of Kim Mi-poong's incident that was deleted... - Yes?</font>

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,659
<font color="yellow">Since that couldn't be restored, Mr. Lee took the videos</font>

88
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:48,245
<font color="yellow">from the previous week up to the day it happened.</font>

89
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,205
<font color="yellow">There won't be any problems, right?</font>

90
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,354
<font color="yellow">Yes, there won't be any problems.</font>

91
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,464
<font color="yellow">No matter how much he looks, he won't be able to find anything.</font>

92
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,341
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee is very tiring.</font>

93
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,727
<font color="yellow">But Mr. Kim scouted him himself.</font>

94
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,155
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about anything.</font>

95
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,381
<font color="yellow">He'll never be able to find out the truth about this incident.</font>

96
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:14,830
<font color="yellow">Still, you never know, so make sure you keep an eye on him.</font>

97
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,088
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am.</font>

98
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,673
<font color="yellow">Once grandfather steps away from the chairman</font>

99
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,431
<font color="yellow">position, Mr. Lee is the first one I'm going to fire.</font>

100
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:39,494
<font color="yellow">(I'm looking for a person)</font>

101
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,799
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for my grandfather who gave this ring with</font>

102
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:46,163
<font color="yellow">the symbol "Cheon" on it to my grandmother Kim Soon-ok.</font>

103
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,119
<font color="yellow">His son's name is Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

104
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,237
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

105
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,848
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong was looking for her grandfather?</font>

106
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:01,818
<font color="yellow">They had this ring with them?</font>

107
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:12,021
<font color="yellow">Is it true that your son got a divorce?</font>

108
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:14,880
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Really?</font>

109
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,653
<font color="yellow">They were bound to find out anyways.</font>

110
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:19,955
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell them on purpose.</font>

111
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's true. It's nothing good, so just pretend like you don't know anything.</font>

112
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,488
<font color="yellow">No matter how much you despised her, divorce isn't the answer.</font>

113
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:30,307
<font color="yellow">Did they get a divorce because Chung-ja's husband had an affair with your in-law?</font>

114
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,294
<font color="yellow">My husband came home.</font>

115
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,177
<font color="yellow">They're not in that kind of relationship!</font>

116
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,114
<font color="yellow">I heard they were in a good relationship. You should have just let them stay together.</font>

117
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,394
<font color="yellow">There was a different reason why they got divorced.</font>

118
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,014
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, you better stop.</font>

119
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:50,236
<font color="yellow">What happened? Did she have an affair, just like her mother did?</font>

120
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,528
<font color="yellow">It's not like that!</font>

121
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,092
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong isn't that kind of girl!</font>

122
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,191
<font color="yellow">Your son must be in shock. When I saw him at the</font>

123
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:59,975
<font color="yellow">wedding, he seemed to love her more than she loved him.</font>

124
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,702
<font color="yellow">If they're not meant to be, they should separate as soon as they can.</font>

125
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,317
<font color="yellow">No. When my cousin was young, my aunt stopped him</font>

126
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:09,086
<font color="yellow">from getting married to the girl he was in love with.</font>

127
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,624
<font color="yellow">He's over fifty-years-old, and yet, he's still thinking</font>

128
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,970
<font color="yellow">about her, and he's about to die as a single, lonely man!</font>

129
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,261
<font color="yellow">My aunt is still doing his laundry and cooking his meals.</font>

130
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:22,963
<font color="yellow">She regrets stopping him from getting married now.</font>

131
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,742
<font color="yellow">Young-soon is right.</font>

132
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:29,053
<font color="yellow">While your daughter-in-law worked, she made 100 cabbages</font>

133
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,306
<font color="yellow">into kimchi and made breakfast and dinner, too.</font>

134
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:33,905
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense!</font>

135
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:37,278
<font color="yellow">There's a valid reason why she kicked her out!</font>

136
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:40,986
<font color="yellow">Is she your daughter-in-law? Why are you so worked up about her?</font>

137
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,556
<font color="yellow">When did I do that?</font>

138
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,172
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying this because you guys are being</font>

139
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,961
<font color="yellow">rude by saying strange things and making Geum-sil upset.</font>

140
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,072
<font color="yellow">Someone's cell-phone is ringing.</font>

141
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,899
<font color="yellow">Isn't that your phone, Chung-ja?</font>

142
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,198
<font color="yellow">Oh, it is.</font>

143
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:59,340
<font color="yellow">It's my daughter-in-law.</font>

144
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:02,114
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

145
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,771
<font color="yellow">Why weren't you picking up your phone?</font>

146
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:09,059
<font color="yellow">I picked up now.</font>

147
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:13,481
<font color="yellow">Mother, does the Sky Newspaper come home?</font>

148
00:09:14,107 --> 00:09:18,348
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Just answer me! Does the Sky Newspaper come home?</font>

149
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,616
<font color="yellow">Yes, it does.</font>

150
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,356
<font color="yellow">But what's wrong?</font>

151
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,427
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

152
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,489
<font color="yellow">What do we do? We're in big trouble, mother!</font>

153
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,645
<font color="yellow">Big trouble? What kind of big trouble?</font>

154
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:35,226
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong put up an ad in the newspaper looking for</font>

155
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,834
<font color="yellow">her grandfather along with a picture of the ring!</font>

156
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:42,391
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she put up an ad? Along with a picture of the ring?</font>

157
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,041
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

158
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,762
<font color="yellow">Mother, where are you right now?</font>

159
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,069
<font color="yellow">I think grandfather is home! Please make sure he can't see the newspaper! Hurry!</font>

160
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:53,238
<font color="yellow">Oh, no! I'm outside though!</font>

161
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,950
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

162
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:59,662
<font color="yellow">Then hurry up and go home! Hurry up!</font>

163
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,583
<font color="yellow">All right! Bye!</font>

164
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:04,950
<font color="yellow">I have to go home.</font>

165
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,887
<font color="yellow">What's up with her?</font>

166
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,523
<font color="yellow">What does she mean by the ad and ring?</font>

167
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,029
<font color="yellow">But is she being controlled by her daughter-in-law? She's</font>

168
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,615
<font color="yellow">shivering with fright because her daughter-in-law yelled at her.</font>

169
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:17,294
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

170
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,591
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim? - Pardon?</font>

171
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:26,266
<font color="yellow">- Where's Mr. Kim? - He's reading the newspaper in his bedroom.</font>

172
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,145
<font color="yellow">Newspaper? What do I do?</font>

173
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,044
<font color="yellow">Give me that.</font>

174
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

175
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:42,598
<font color="yellow">(I'm looking for a person)</font>

176
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,966
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, what are you doing?</font>

177
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,324
<font color="yellow">I brought you some tea.</font>

178
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:54,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

179
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,702
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

180
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,044
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.</font>

181
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:01,685
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

182
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:05,849
<font color="yellow">I spilled tea on the newspaper.</font>

183
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,153
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

184
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,711
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

185
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:13,239
<font color="yellow">I'll tell the housekeeper to clean this up.</font>

186
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,559
<font color="yellow">I wasn't done with the newspaper.</font>

187
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,630
<font color="yellow">How are you always so clumsy?</font>

188
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:23,562
<font color="yellow">But Shin-ae, what are you doing home at this time?</font>

189
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:27,331
<font color="yellow">I left a document at home.</font>

190
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,887
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

191
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,157
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go to work a little bit later.</font>

192
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,466
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

193
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,817
<font color="yellow">It's over there.</font>

194
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:39,676
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

195
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:43,497
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Where did she get this ring from?</font>

196
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,512
<font color="yellow">That little kid had really taken it.</font>

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,566
<font color="yellow">What will we do?</font>

198
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:55,466
<font color="yellow">What if Yoo-sung tells them that there's a similar ring at our house?</font>

199
00:11:57,786 --> 00:12:01,591
<font color="yellow">There are many similar rings like this in this world.</font>

200
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,621
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem right now.</font>

201
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,770
<font color="yellow">Why the heck did they suddenly put up this ad?</font>

202
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:10,522
<font color="yellow">How did they know they have a grandfather?</font>

203
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,552
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. What will we do?</font>

204
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,188
<font color="yellow">We somehow solved this today, but what about next time?</font>

205
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,503
<font color="yellow">They can put ads anywhere else besides the newspaper, too.</font>

206
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,298
<font color="yellow">We need to somehow make sure they can't put up another ad.</font>

207
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,903
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

208
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,577
<font color="yellow">How can we stop them when they're using their money to put up this ad?</font>

209
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:38,661
<font color="yellow">- (Homemade Kimbap) -Buy kimbap! Buy some kimbap!</font>

210
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,768
<font color="yellow">This is homemade kimbap!</font>

211
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,669
<font color="yellow">-Buy kimbap! - Four rows, please.</font>

212
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:44,694
<font color="yellow">Sure!</font>

213
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:47,574
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Enjoy.</font>

214
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,119
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

215
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:50,976
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

216
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,124
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

217
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,874
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, I'm the one who put up the ad!</font>

218
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,259
<font color="yellow">You know Kim Soon-ok?</font>

219
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:08,952
<font color="yellow">The ring, too?</font>

220
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:12,618
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes! I'll go over there right now!</font>

221
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:13,913
<font color="yellow">Yes! Bye!</font>

222
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,396
<font color="yellow">- He knows the ring? - I think this is really grandfather, mom!</font>

223
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:23,577
<font color="yellow">- Okay, let's hurry up and go! - Let's go!</font>

224
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:48,108
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who called us because of the ad?</font>

225
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,991
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please have a seat.</font>

226
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:06,069
<font color="yellow">This is the ring my mother-in-law used to wear.</font>

227
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:08,770
<font color="yellow">Is this the right ring?</font>

228
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:14,085
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the ring I gave her.</font>

229
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,077
<font color="yellow">I gave it to her when we got married.</font>

230
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:22,202
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that you still have this ring with you.</font>

231
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:30,390
<font color="yellow">Then where is your hometown?</font>

232
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:31,647
<font color="yellow">Pyeong...</font>

233
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:39,704
<font color="yellow">It's been so long that I don't remember, but Kim Soon-ok is the right person.</font>

234
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:45,194
<font color="yellow">Then do you know my father, Kim Dae-hoon?</font>

235
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,350
<font color="yellow">Is he really your son?</font>

236
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:52,108
<font color="yellow">But I don't know if I have a son or not.</font>

237
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:56,096
<font color="yellow">Then what's your name?</font>

238
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,382
<font color="yellow">Kim Han-cheon.</font>

239
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:04,693
<font color="yellow">I think I'm the one you have been looking for.</font>

240
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:08,035
<font color="yellow">That is the ring I gave her.</font>

241
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:13,015
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes, you are my father-in-law.</font>

242
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:17,754
<font color="yellow">I knew your name would have Cheon in it.</font>

243
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:21,449
<font color="yellow">That's why Cheon is engraved into this ring.</font>

244
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,886
<font color="yellow">- Father. - Grandfather.</font>

245
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,394
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

246
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:44,511
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that you searched for me, but I hope you won't contact me anymore.</font>

247
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:50,808
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

248
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:57,916
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for saying this as soon as we meet for the first time,</font>

249
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:02,574
<font color="yellow">but I already have a family here.</font>

250
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,638
<font color="yellow">I have a wife, son, and daughter.</font>

251
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,288
<font color="yellow">If they find out about this, they'll be shocked and uncomfortable.</font>

252
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,241
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

253
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:23,342
<font color="yellow">Don't put up an ad again.</font>

254
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,915
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked for us to meet here today.</font>

255
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:31,218
<font color="yellow">Father, but still-</font>

256
00:16:31,243 --> 00:16:37,442
<font color="yellow">But still, aren't you curious about your son?</font>

257
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,858
<font color="yellow">My father is your son, too.</font>

258
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,327
<font color="yellow">All this time, I didn't know I had a son in North Korea.</font>

259
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,490
<font color="yellow">I thought Kim Soon-ok was dead, too.</font>

260
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,975
<font color="yellow">What's the point of my children finding out about this right now?</font>

261
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,897
<font color="yellow">So don't contact me anymore.</font>

262
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:04,499
<font color="yellow">But-</font>

263
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:12,637
<font color="yellow">Okay, I understand.</font>

264
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:14,997
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

265
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,081
<font color="yellow">Let me beg you one more time.</font>

266
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:29,572
<font color="yellow">Don't put up an ad again.</font>

267
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:33,539
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll live well in South Korea.</font>

268
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,098
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

269
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,410
<font color="yellow">passed away while escaping North Korea.</font>

270
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:43,825
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

271
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:10,473
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

272
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:14,731
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

273
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,464
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have suggested we look for your grandfather.</font>

274
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,800
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't done that,</font>

275
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:29,988
<font color="yellow">we would've still had hope that we would find him one day.</font>

276
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

277
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:40,512
<font color="yellow">I might mean nothing to him...</font>

278
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,056
<font color="yellow">but you're still his granddaughter.</font>

279
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:48,037
<font color="yellow">He has Yoo-sung, too.</font>

280
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:54,847
<font color="yellow">Mom, we lived well without grandfather all this time.</font>

281
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,106
<font color="yellow">You, Yoo-sung, and me.</font>

282
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:01,702
<font color="yellow">The three of us will live happily together.</font>

283
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,177
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

284
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:10,951
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's do that.</font>

285
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,791
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what are you doing?</font>

286
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,067
<font color="yellow">Mom, grandfather should meet Yoo-sung at least once.</font>

287
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,758
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell him to meet Yoo-sung once and give him a hug.</font>

288
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,364
<font color="yellow">He's not answering his phone though.</font>

289
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,730
<font color="yellow">It's true that he doesn't want to meet us.</font>

290
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:02,225
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's just pretend your grandfather passed away.</font>

291
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:07,567
<font color="yellow">Still, if he's really my grandfather...</font>

292
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:11,597
<font color="yellow">He's too much.</font>

293
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,504
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

294
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:43,762
<font color="yellow">I put enough money in there, so make sure to change your phone number.</font>

295
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:45,582
<font color="yellow">Of course I will.</font>

296
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:47,808
<font color="yellow">Did you make any mistakes?</font>

297
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,469
<font color="yellow">Did you make sure to tell them not to put up another ad?</font>

298
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:53,050
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about a thing!</font>

299
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,317
<font color="yellow">Didn't they doubt you?</font>

300
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:01,260
<font color="yellow">I did as you taught me, and they didn't seem to doubt me at all.</font>

301
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:07,543
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you need me again.</font>

302
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:11,052
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

303
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:18,534
<font color="yellow">She got kicked out of the company and the house, so I thought it was all over.</font>

304
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:21,798
<font color="yellow">But now she even put up an ad searching for her grandfather.</font>

305
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,197
<font color="yellow">I feel so uneasy that I can't live.</font>

306
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,434
<font color="yellow">Anyways, what will we do now that the ring is back on that woman's hand again?</font>

307
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,817
<font color="yellow">It's not like you can steal it back now. How will</font>

308
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:37,528
<font color="yellow">you be able to do that when it's on her finger?</font>

309
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:39,579
<font color="yellow">Just stealing that won't solve this problem.</font>

310
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:43,283
<font color="yellow">Then what can we do in order to never see them again?</font>

311
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:47,668
<font color="yellow">Mother, I have a good idea.</font>

312
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,324
<font color="yellow">Good idea? What good idea?</font>

313
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:03,871
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, it's me, Shin-ae.</font>

314
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:06,364
<font color="yellow">Can we meet up right now?</font>

315
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:17,410
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Ms. Joo. - Welcome.</font>

316
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:19,618
<font color="yellow">It was hard finding the house, right?</font>

317
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:23,856
<font color="yellow">No. I followed your directions and got here in no time at all.</font>

318
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:26,105
<font color="yellow">It's shabby, but come on in.</font>

319
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:27,473
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

320
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,836
<font color="yellow">You said you had something to tell me. What is it?</font>

321
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:45,683
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't help Mi-poong this time.</font>

322
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,942
<font color="yellow">I tried to prevent her from getting fired, but my grandfather</font>

323
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:52,898
<font color="yellow">was so adamant that I couldn't do anything about it.</font>

324
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,182
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your kind words.</font>

325
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,797
<font color="yellow">I heard Mi-poong got divorced.</font>

326
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:03,571
<font color="yellow">Was it because of what happened at the company this time?</font>

327
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:12,070
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened either. I felt hopeless and resented the heavens.</font>

328
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:17,813
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong is doing fine, so you don't have to worry.</font>

329
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:21,930
<font color="yellow">But did you come here just to say that?</font>

330
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:24,532
<font color="yellow">To be honest...</font>

331
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:32,662
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you, Mi-poong, and Yoo-sung would be willing to go to America.</font>

332
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:35,235
<font color="yellow">What? America?</font>

333
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,911
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll make sure Mi-poong can work at the headquarters in America.</font>

334
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,045
<font color="yellow">Many people go to America to study these days.</font>

335
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:46,103
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung can study there, too.</font>

336
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,454
<font color="yellow">I'll support you guys.</font>

337
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,411
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious?</font>

338
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:55,493
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

339
00:23:56,813 --> 00:24:01,860
<font color="yellow">But why would you give us such a good opportunity?</font>

340
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:06,243
<font color="yellow">I'm very indebted to you.</font>

341
00:24:06,774 --> 00:24:08,488
<font color="yellow">I would like to pay you back now.</font>

342
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:11,297
<font color="yellow">Discuss it with Mi-poong.</font>

343
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:20,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you so much.</font>

344
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:25,620
<font color="yellow">Make a decision as soon as possible, so that I can get started on the procedure.</font>

345
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:30,336
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll discuss this with Mi-poong when she comes home and let you know.</font>

346
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,336
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, thank you so much.</font>

347
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:42,890
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

348
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,804
<font color="yellow">Delivery!</font>

349
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:59,461
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Mi-poong. This is the last stop for you, right? - Yes, I'm done for today.</font>

350
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:02,069
<font color="yellow">We're going to order late-night snacks. Join us.</font>

351
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,950
<font color="yellow">No, I have plans already.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

352
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,135
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Enjoy your snacks.</font>

353
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:12,704
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

354
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:14,204
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

355
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:18,914
<font color="yellow">You left your cosmetics at home. I brought them all here for you.</font>

356
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:20,946
<font color="yellow">I'm cool, aren't I?</font>

357
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:25,321
<font color="yellow">Is that why you've been calling me the entire day?</font>

358
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:27,962
<font color="yellow">It's nothing important anyways.</font>

359
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,773
<font color="yellow">You're started to tick me off!</font>

360
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,993
<font color="yellow">I'm so busy, but I brought these for you because I thought you would</font>

361
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:36,508
<font color="yellow">be uncomfortable without them! Should I just throw them away?</font>

362
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,123
<font color="yellow">Why would you do such a thing? There's still a lot left.</font>

363
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:41,758
<font color="yellow">You're grateful, aren't you?</font>

364
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:44,774
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Good-bye.</font>

365
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:46,344
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!</font>

366
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,499
<font color="yellow">You're so mean!</font>

367
00:25:49,524 --> 00:25:52,764
<font color="yellow">I brought your cosmetics for you, but you're just going to leave like that?</font>

368
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,255
<font color="yellow">We signed the divorce papers, Jang-go.</font>

369
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:59,035
<font color="yellow">It takes one month for the final decision to go through.</font>

370
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:02,377
<font color="yellow">We can only get divorced if we report to the borough office a month later.</font>

371
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:04,390
<font color="yellow">We're still a married couple.</font>

372
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:06,923
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

373
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:11,088
<font color="yellow">at least send me off.</font>

374
00:26:13,712 --> 00:26:16,335
<font color="yellow">You're such a lawyer. You're all bark and no bite.</font>

375
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,352
<font color="yellow">Quiet! Follow me.</font>

376
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,970
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

377
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,821
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

378
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:41,460
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You're acting like a stranger.</font>

379
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,813
<font color="yellow">I told you that we're still a married couple.</font>

380
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:47,549
<font color="yellow">Get in. I'll take you home.</font>

381
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:50,091
<font color="yellow">-Jang-go! -I know. I know.</font>

382
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:55,265
<font color="yellow">"Why would I ride in your car? You go your way, and I'll go mine."</font>

383
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,008
<font color="yellow">That's what you were going to say, right?</font>

384
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,922
<font color="yellow">You know, so why did you even say such a thing?</font>

385
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,766
<font color="yellow">Just leave already!</font>

386
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:09,520
<font color="yellow">She'll turn back at least once, won't she?</font>

387
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:15,446
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

388
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:21,258
<font color="yellow">Drive safely.</font>

389
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:24,202
<font color="yellow">Whatever! I'm going to drive as I please!</font>

390
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:43,422
<font color="yellow">What? She's going to America? Is that true?</font>

391
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:48,165
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law took pity on Mi-poong's family, so out</font>

392
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:52,798
<font color="yellow">of old times' sake, she's going to send them to America.</font>

393
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:55,438
<font color="yellow">Great, isn't it?</font>

394
00:27:56,712 --> 00:27:59,024
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if they really did leave.</font>

395
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:01,023
<font color="yellow">But are they really leaving?</font>

396
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:05,087
<font color="yellow">Of course they are. What kind of fool would lose such a good opportunity?</font>

397
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,633
<font color="yellow">On top of that, she's divorced!</font>

398
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,627
<font color="yellow">I guess. All right. Anyways, thank you.</font>

399
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:16,892
<font color="yellow">Thank you for letting me borrow this.</font>

400
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,975
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong's family is going to America?</font>

401
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,782
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

402
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:24,033
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja's daughter-in-law is going to send them.</font>

403
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,880
<font color="yellow">They're really going to leave? What about Jang-go?</font>

404
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,314
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? They're divorced.</font>

405
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,653
<font color="yellow">They have nothing to do with Jang-go now.</font>

406
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:37,087
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is going to send me to the American</font>

407
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:39,375
<font color="yellow">headquarters? Why would she do such a thing?</font>

408
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,954
<font color="yellow">She said she's indebted to us and wanted to pay us back for it.</font>

409
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:48,876
<font color="yellow">Also, she felt bad she couldn't help you when you got fired from the company.</font>

410
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:50,948
<font color="yellow">She really said that?</font>

411
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:57,961
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, if it's all right with you, I want us to go to America.</font>

412
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:02,477
<font color="yellow">It would be good for Yoo-sung's future. On top of that, you can</font>

413
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:06,412
<font color="yellow">forget about all the bad things here and start fresh there.</font>

414
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:14,197
<font color="yellow">Mom, I don't have a good feeling about Shin-ae making such an offer to us.</font>

415
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:17,882
<font color="yellow">And I don't really want to go either.</font>

416
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:23,678
<font color="yellow">Is this because of Jang-go?</font>

417
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:48,382
<font color="yellow">It takes one month for the final decision to go through. We can</font>

418
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:51,321
<font color="yellow">only get divorced if we report to the borough office a month later.</font>

419
00:29:51,595 --> 00:29:53,243
<font color="yellow">We're still a married couple.</font>

420
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:03,728
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

421
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:08,992
<font color="yellow">I should keep wearing this ring, shouldn't I?</font>

422
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,430
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's father's ring.</font>

423
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:13,671
<font color="yellow">It's the ring that grandmother always wore.</font>

424
00:30:14,532 --> 00:30:15,532
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

425
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:19,321
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

426
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:22,719
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, are you okay?</font>

427
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,024
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, mom.</font>

428
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,088
<font color="yellow">I don't have anymore hope of finding your grandfather anymore.</font>

429
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:36,823
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I want us to go to America.</font>

430
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:41,285
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy living there, but it'll be easier than living here.</font>

431
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:44,767
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

432
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,524
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll think about it.</font>

433
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:55,977
<font color="yellow">"Please drop us a thick rope! Please!"</font>

434
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:04,268
<font color="yellow">And that's how the kind brother and sister climbed up the thick rope to safety.</font>

435
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,790
<font color="yellow">Then what about the terrible tiger?</font>

436
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:13,093
<font color="yellow">The greedy tiger that tried to eat the brother and sister</font>

437
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:21,431
<font color="yellow">climbed up a tattered rope that snapped, and he fell to his death.</font>

438
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,817
<font color="yellow">Then did the brother and sister who went up to the sky live happily ever after?</font>

439
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,200
<font color="yellow">Of course they did!</font>

440
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,737
<font color="yellow">They became the sun and the moon and lived happily ever after for a long time.</font>

441
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:39,667
<font color="yellow">So should you be good or bad?</font>

442
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:41,738
<font color="yellow">You must be good!</font>

443
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:45,419
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're so smart!</font>

444
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:10,879
<font color="yellow">How could that tiny thing make me do this for her?</font>

445
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:12,701
<font color="yellow">- Oh! - Oh!</font>

446
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,271
<font color="yellow">Weren't you asleep yet?</font>

447
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:19,158
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yoo-jin wanted to eat ice cream.</font>

448
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,201
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin isn't sleeping yet either?</font>

449
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,560
<font color="yellow">Yes, she has no sleep at all.</font>

450
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:26,099
<font color="yellow">- Good night. - Good night.</font>

451
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:31,332
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim!</font>

452
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:35,654
<font color="yellow">- Dal-ho! Chung-ja! Hurry up! - Mom!</font>

453
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,695
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim! - Mr. Kim!</font>

454
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,960
<font color="yellow">Grandfather!</font>

455
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:42,005
<font color="yellow">- Grandfather! - What's going on?</font>

456
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:13,177
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

457
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,440
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Thank you.</font>

458
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,735
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, is Mi-poong really going to America?</font>

459
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,130
<font color="yellow">Looks like it.</font>

460
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:47,171
<font color="yellow">It seems like she's really going to divorce Jang-go.</font>

461
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,341
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? They already divorced.</font>

462
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:53,352
<font color="yellow">There are many couples who go to court to get divorced but</font>

463
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:56,240
<font color="yellow">end up changing their minds during the consideration period.</font>

464
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,760
<font color="yellow">But if she's going to America, it means she's determined to divorce him.</font>

465
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:05,107
<font color="yellow">I didn't think Mi-poong and Jang-go were actually going to get divorced.</font>

466
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:11,087
<font color="yellow">If she goes to America, they'll really become complete strangers.</font>

467
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:15,513
<font color="yellow">Aunt, is it true that Mi-poong is going to America?</font>

468
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:18,526
<font color="yellow">Yeah, the director of your company said she was going</font>

469
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,624
<font color="yellow">to send Mi-poong to the American headquarters.</font>

470
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:22,221
<font color="yellow">Right, Geum-sil?</font>

471
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:28,443
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

472
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:34,153
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, why would you tell him such a thing?</font>

473
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:51,473
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what are you doing here?</font>

474
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,739
<font color="yellow">Is it true you're going to America?</font>

475
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:57,108
<font color="yellow">- How did you know that? - That's not important!</font>

476
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,315
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to America?</font>

477
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:01,395
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what's wrong with you?</font>

478
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:05,256
<font color="yellow">Whether I go to Russia or America, it's my choice now.</font>

479
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,310
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

480
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:13,102
<font color="yellow">I divorced you because you said my house was like hell.</font>

481
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,163
<font color="yellow">Because I wanted you to be free from my hell-</font>

482
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:17,021
<font color="yellow">like house. Because I wanted you to recover.</font>

483
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:18,540
<font color="yellow">That's why I divorced you.</font>

484
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,289
<font color="yellow">But what? You're going to America?</font>

485
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:25,450
<font color="yellow">You can never go. You got that?</font>

486
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,099
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

487
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:35,372
<font color="yellow">Fine. You can go to America or Russia.</font>

488
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:38,232
<font color="yellow">But tell me when you make a final decision.</font>

489
00:35:38,575 --> 00:35:40,866
<font color="yellow">Why? Why do I have to do that?</font>

490
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:42,461
<font color="yellow">If you go, I'm going, too.</font>

491
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:44,419
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

492
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,887
<font color="yellow">I'll never send you by yourself.</font>

493
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:50,908
<font color="yellow">If you go, I'll go, too. Just keep that in mind.</font>

494
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,786
<font color="yellow">We got a divorce, so why is he being like this?</font>

495
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:07,114
<font color="yellow">Is Mi-poong really going to America?</font>

496
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:11,692
<font color="yellow">Does this mean she wants to stop her feelings for Jang-go and live away from him?</font>

497
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

498
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:19,356
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here during lunch time?</font>

499
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:22,316
<font color="yellow">Lee Nam-yi, let's have a company meal today.</font>

500
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:25,646
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? Why are we suddenly having a company meal?</font>

501
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:28,714
<font color="yellow">Because I think the reason you were trying to quit</font>

502
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:31,164
<font color="yellow">is because we never had a company meal before.</font>

503
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:33,581
<font color="yellow">There can be no other reason besides that.</font>

504
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:36,317
<font color="yellow">That's why we're going to have a company meal.</font>

505
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,708
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

506
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,076
<font color="yellow">Then how about pork belly and soju-</font>

507
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

508
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,563
<font color="yellow">- Please put it here. - Yes, sir.</font>

509
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,278
<font color="yellow">Eighty dollars.</font>

510
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,615
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

511
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:00,926
<font color="yellow">What are all these?</font>

512
00:37:01,161 --> 00:37:02,445
<font color="yellow">We're having a company meal.</font>

513
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:07,149
<font color="yellow">How is this a company meal? And who has a company meal in the daytime?</font>

514
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:10,489
<font color="yellow">This is why I wanted to quit!</font>

515
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:15,077
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I'm going to eat outside, so pig yourself out!</font>

516
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,092
<font color="yellow">Do you really not like company meals in the daytime?</font>

517
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:34,106
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

518
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,771
<font color="yellow">Father, should I leave?</font>

519
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:44,286
<font color="yellow">I brought my friends because I heard we were going to have a company meal today.</font>

520
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:46,090
<font color="yellow">Should we go to the bakery?</font>

521
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:47,637
<font color="yellow">No, come on in.</font>

522
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:51,671
<font color="yellow">And from now on, Won-bin, read the atmosphere before you come in.</font>

523
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:53,349
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful from now on.</font>

524
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,587
<font color="yellow">Come and eat, all of you.</font>

525
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,358
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, just like you said, Nam-yi is so pretty!</font>

526
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,989
<font color="yellow">- She's super sexy! - Right?</font>

527
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:12,208
<font color="yellow">Kids these days are so honest! What are you doing? Eat up!</font>

528
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:16,013
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - You guys are so smart!</font>

529
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:20,879
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Eat a lot!</font>

530
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:23,481
<font color="yellow">How much is the kimbap?</font>

531
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,254
<font color="yellow">Two dollars per roll.</font>

532
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,279
<font color="yellow">Please give me two.</font>

533
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:52,825
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, are you hungry?</font>

534
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,950
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - We're almost there.</font>

535
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,583
<font color="yellow">It looks like they're selling food near the subway station.</font>

536
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,571
<font color="yellow">They sell a lot of things, like kimbap, rice cakes, and coffee.</font>

537
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:10,483
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang, I'd like to try Seoul kimbap.</font>

538
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,260
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that.</font>

539
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:15,312
<font color="yellow">Please stop next to the subway station.</font>

540
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:16,747
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

541
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:29,317
<font color="yellow">All this time, I didn't know I had a son in North Korea.</font>

542
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,305
<font color="yellow">I thought Kim Soon-ok was dead, too.</font>

543
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:36,963
<font color="yellow">What's the point of my children finding out about this right now?</font>

544
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:41,551
<font color="yellow">Let me beg you one more time. Don't put up an ad again.</font>

545
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:49,145
<font color="yellow">He met his bloodline, so how can he be so cold?</font>

546
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:52,305
<font color="yellow">Is he really Mi-poong's grandfather?</font>

547
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:56,826
<font color="yellow">How much is the kimbap?</font>

548
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,839
<font color="yellow">Two dollars per roll.</font>

549
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,364
<font color="yellow">Please give me four rolls.</font>

550
00:40:14,856 --> 00:40:15,856
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

551
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,130
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

552
00:40:18,802 --> 00:40:20,223
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, let's go.</font>

553
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:40,278
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

554
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:43,489
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

555
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:47,208
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon! Dae-hoon!</font>

556
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:51,646
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon! Dae-hoon!</font>

557
00:41:08,725 --> 00:41:09,725
<font color="yellow">Hi, mom.</font>

558
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,850
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong. Mi-poong!</font>

559
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,366
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's wrong? Did something happen?</font>

560
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:19,936
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, come home at once! I saw your father!</font>

561
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:22,577
<font color="yellow">What? You saw who?</font>

562
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:30,756
<font color="yellow">Mom, drink some water.</font>

563
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:51,138
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I saw your father! He bought the kimbap that I made! I'm serious, Mi-poong!</font>

564
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:52,632
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

565
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,035
<font color="yellow">You think I'm crazy, don't you?</font>

566
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:58,835
<font color="yellow">I feel like I've been bewitched, but I'm serious, Mi-poong!</font>

567
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,160
<font color="yellow">Your father looks a little different than before, but I'm telling you the truth!</font>

568
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:07,734
<font color="yellow">The person with him called him Dae-hoon! I heard him with my own two ears!</font>

569
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:14,616
<font color="yellow">He rode away in a taxi, so I couldn't catch him, but I'm sure he was your father!</font>

570
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:16,928
<font color="yellow">Mom, calm down.</font>

571
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:21,101
<font color="yellow">I thought your father died from a gunshot at Amnok River, but he's alive!</font>

572
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,460
<font color="yellow">He's alive, and he's here in South Korea!</font>

573
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:30,976
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what if your brother is alive, too?</font>

574
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,765
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's wrong with you?</font>

575
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:37,468
<font color="yellow">I wish father was alive, too. I wish the man you saw was father, too.</font>

576
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:43,250
<font color="yellow">But if he really was father, why didn't he search for us all this time?</font>

577
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:45,608
<font color="yellow">If he really is father,</font>

578
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,140
<font color="yellow">shouldn't he have recognized you right away?</font>

579
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,489
<font color="yellow">How could he not recognize you? That just doesn't make any sense!</font>

580
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:54,773
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

581
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,531
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

582
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:58,329
<font color="yellow">He would have, right?</font>

583
00:42:59,531 --> 00:43:03,371
<font color="yellow">If he was your father, there's no way he wouldn't have recognized me, right?</font>

584
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:09,812
<font color="yellow">But then who did I see? Was I seeing a hallucination?</font>

585
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:13,912
<font color="yellow">You probably did see a hallucination because you were so</font>

586
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:17,109
<font color="yellow">hopeless and devastated after what grandfather did to us.</font>

587
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:23,272
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I didn't tell you this,</font>

588
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:32,757
<font color="yellow">but I was so bitter and upset because of your grandfather.</font>

589
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:38,765
<font color="yellow">Your grandmother wore this ring all her life and couldn't rest in peace</font>

590
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:43,737
<font color="yellow">because she couldn't meet your grandfather before she passed away.</font>

591
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:49,781
<font color="yellow">How could he do this to us? Is he really your grandfather? I feel so upset and bitter!</font>

592
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:58,361
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's why I saw a hallucination, Mi-poong.</font>

593
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,241
<font color="yellow">That must be it.</font>

594
00:44:01,924 --> 00:44:02,924
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

595
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:06,978
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

596
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:10,689
<font color="yellow">But I really saw him.</font>

597
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,947
<font color="yellow">I really did.</font>

598
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:18,065
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay.</font>

599
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:28,181
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, you promised to be by my side for a long time.</font>

600
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,580
<font color="yellow">But you keep getting sick...</font>

601
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,072
<font color="yellow">I'm so distressed, grandfather.</font>

602
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:41,950
<font color="yellow">Dr. Yang said this keeps on happening because I'm old.</font>

603
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,345
<font color="yellow">But don't worry.</font>

604
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:50,822
<font color="yellow">I will never leave you behind and die so soon.</font>

605
00:44:54,908 --> 00:45:01,250
<font color="yellow">How tenacious can he be? He looks like he's about to die, but he never does.</font>

606
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:07,165
<font color="yellow">No. Mr. Kim can't pass away right now.</font>

607
00:45:09,283 --> 00:45:12,619
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, go to work. I'll stay here.</font>

608
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,385
<font color="yellow">No, father, I'll stay here, too.</font>

609
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:16,994
<font color="yellow">No, Shin-ae.</font>

610
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:22,000
<font color="yellow">I'm okay, so go to work.</font>

611
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:23,923
<font color="yellow">Yes, do that.</font>

612
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:26,444
<font color="yellow">I'll be here, too. Come, come.</font>

613
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:36,744
<font color="yellow">Mother, is something wrong?</font>

614
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:41,471
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, this won't do. We need to hurry up and put you in the family registry.</font>

615
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,393
<font color="yellow">Why so suddenly?</font>

616
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:45,377
<font color="yellow">Why else?</font>

617
00:45:45,815 --> 00:45:49,719
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim keeps fainting like this. What will happen if he passes away?</font>

618
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,281
<font color="yellow">You're Park Shin-ae, not Kim Shin-ae.</font>

619
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:58,240
<font color="yellow">Then you won't be able to become the legal heiress.</font>

620
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,244
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

621
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:04,210
<font color="yellow">I already filed to change my last name. Isn't that effective?</font>

622
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:08,032
<font color="yellow">On top of that, everyone in the company knows I'm his granddaughter.</font>

623
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:11,121
<font color="yellow">How frustrating can you be?</font>

624
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:13,775
<font color="yellow">To be frank, you can't even get a DNA test with</font>

625
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,862
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, so what's the use of all of that?</font>

626
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:20,836
<font color="yellow">In front of law, documents are the answer.</font>

627
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:22,699
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

628
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:24,812
<font color="yellow">We need to be sure of it.</font>

629
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,613
<font color="yellow">Hi, Lawyer Cha. It's me.</font>

630
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:36,753
<font color="yellow">I was just curious if my daughter-in-law Shin-ae</font>

631
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:42,116
<font color="yellow">was on Mr. Kim's family registry yet.</font>

632
00:46:43,702 --> 00:46:44,835
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

633
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:47,897
<font color="yellow">You think it's going to take over a month?</font>

634
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:55,303
<font color="yellow">Look here, Mr. Cha! Mr. Kim wanted you to hurry up, so what's taking you so long?</font>

635
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:56,671
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

636
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:03,163
<font color="yellow">Mr. Cha, speed things up.</font>

637
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:07,358
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is waiting for you.</font>

638
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,499
<font color="yellow">Please do your best.</font>

639
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:16,673
<font color="yellow">What's so hard about changing someone's last name? Why is he taking so long?</font>

640
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:20,428
<font color="yellow">He's getting paid a lot, too.</font>

641
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:52,294
<font color="yellow">Mom! What are you doing out here? I told you to rest tonight.</font>

642
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:54,905
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

643
00:47:55,976 --> 00:48:00,725
<font color="yellow">Mom, by any chance, did you come out here because you thought you could meet father?</font>

644
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:05,816
<font color="yellow">Mom, you said you were hallucinating. Why are you doing this? It upsets me.</font>

645
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:11,514
<font color="yellow">It's not like that. I said I'm fine.</font>

646
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:01,050
<font color="yellow">What kind of phone call does he need to take outside away from me?</font>

647
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,749
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang, what do you mean you think you found Mr. Kim's son?</font>

648
00:49:16,444 --> 00:49:19,125
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you the details after I meet Mr. Kim.</font>

649
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:22,170
<font color="yellow">However, I can't get in touch with him.</font>

650
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:26,733
<font color="yellow">He's in the hospital right now because he isn't feeling well.</font>

651
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:29,366
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

652
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:33,553
<font color="yellow">I think it would be better if I go over there and check it out myself first. Bye.</font>

653
00:49:37,765 --> 00:49:39,717
<font color="yellow">Honey, where are you going?</font>

654
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:47,147
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is lying in the hospital, but where is he going in such a rush?</font>

655
00:49:49,577 --> 00:49:52,436
<font color="yellow">Is he going to meet that woman again?</font>

656
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,257
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

657
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:57,866
<font color="yellow">He's devoted to Mr. Kim.</font>

658
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:04,769
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is lying sick in bed. Yes. He won't do such a thing.</font>

659
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:28,991
<font color="yellow">He's Mr. Kim's son?</font>

660
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:33,007
<font color="yellow">According to the information I gathered, I'm sure he is.</font>

661
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:37,890
<font color="yellow">I brought him so that he could do a DNA test with Mr. Kim.</font>

662
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:43,264
<font color="yellow">We thought he was dead, so how could this miracle happen?</font>

663
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,187
<font color="yellow">But Mr. Yang, his behavior is a bit peculiar...</font>

664
00:50:58,335 --> 00:51:00,170
<font color="yellow">He's like a child, isn't he?</font>

665
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,319
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

666
00:51:03,796 --> 00:51:07,035
<font color="yellow">Because of the trauma of the gun wound he received while running</font>

667
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,148
<font color="yellow">away from North Korea, he thinks he's ten years old right now.</font>

668
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:12,616
<font color="yellow">Ten?</font>

669
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:16,592
<font color="yellow">Yes. His memory stopped at the age of ten.</font>

670
00:51:33,976 --> 00:51:35,309
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

671
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:38,491
<font color="yellow">Where's my wife?</font>

672
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:41,418
<font color="yellow">I sent her home.</font>

673
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:44,468
<font color="yellow">I was going to discharge when you came back.</font>

674
00:51:45,225 --> 00:51:46,335
<font color="yellow">You're going to discharge?</font>

675
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,006
<font color="yellow">Of course. I know all about illness, so why would I stay here?</font>

676
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:52,062
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful, so let's go home.</font>

677
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,827
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, are you sure you're okay?</font>

678
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:56,702
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

679
00:51:57,577 --> 00:52:00,631
<font color="yellow">That's why Dr. Yang took out the IV.</font>

680
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,038
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

681
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:04,947
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

682
00:52:05,976 --> 00:52:06,976
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

683
00:52:08,218 --> 00:52:10,418
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell me?</font>

684
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:13,108
<font color="yellow">You can't be shocked.</font>

685
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:15,522
<font color="yellow">Brace yourself.</font>

686
00:52:15,835 --> 00:52:17,545
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

687
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:23,280
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, the broker Mr. Yang is here.</font>

688
00:52:23,796 --> 00:52:27,245
<font color="yellow">Why would he be here when he should be in China?</font>

689
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:33,960
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang brought someone who he suspects to be your son, Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

690
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:42,460
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

691
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:47,774
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

692
00:52:49,218 --> 00:52:53,846
<font color="yellow">My son isn't dead? He's alive?</font>

693
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:56,874
<font color="yellow">My son Dae-hoon?</font>

694
00:52:58,366 --> 00:52:59,366
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim...</font>

695
00:52:59,686 --> 00:53:03,108
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

696
00:53:04,202 --> 00:53:09,051
<font color="yellow">I need to meet him myself. Where is he?</font>

697
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:13,645
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim, are you sure you'll be okay? - I'm fine!</font>

698
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:15,015
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

699
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:17,840
<font color="yellow">- Where is he? - Mr. Kim.</font>

700
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:19,967
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

701
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:26,085
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

702
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:47,866
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang.</font>

703
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:52,936
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

704
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:57,554
<font color="yellow">The man you came in with...</font>

705
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:00,999
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

706
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:03,616
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

707
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:13,874
<font color="yellow">Are you Dae-hoon?</font>

708
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:16,983
<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon?</font>

709
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:23,771
<font color="yellow">But who are you, mister?</font>

710
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:26,753
<font color="yellow">Kim Deok-cheon.</font>

711
00:54:29,554 --> 00:54:31,085
<font color="yellow">Have you heard my name before?</font>

712
00:54:34,046 --> 00:54:35,663
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

713
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,702
<font color="yellow">what's your mother's name?</font>

714
00:54:40,937 --> 00:54:42,350
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

715
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:46,358
<font color="yellow">My mother's name is Kim Soon-ok.</font>

716
00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:49,444
<font color="yellow">Do you know my mother?</font>

717
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:56,108
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

718
00:54:56,921 --> 00:54:57,921
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

719
00:54:58,874 --> 00:54:59,874
<font color="yellow">your father.</font>

720
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:06,063
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about your father?</font>

721
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:07,679
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

722
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,342
<font color="yellow">My father is an amazing person.</font>

723
00:55:12,648 --> 00:55:17,960
<font color="yellow">He's a national hero who died during the Victorious War.</font>

724
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:23,656
<font color="yellow">What? National hero?</font>

725
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:29,125
<font color="yellow">Because of his gun shot wound, his mind is stuck at ten years old right now.</font>

726
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:34,621
<font color="yellow">Sometimes his memories do return, but he lost most of them.</font>

727
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,236
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, are you all right?</font>

728
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,428
<font color="yellow">Mr. Yang,</font>

729
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:49,475
<font color="yellow">are you saying he comes back to normal sometimes?</font>

730
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:54,039
<font color="yellow">Yes. A few days ago, his memories came back, and</font>

731
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:58,010
<font color="yellow">when I asked him, he seemed to know your name.</font>

732
00:55:58,444 --> 00:55:59,444
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

733
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:03,024
<font color="yellow">He really knows me?</font>

734
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:08,723
<font color="yellow">That's why Mr. Yang brought him to Seoul. So that you two could do a DNA test.</font>

735
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:19,686
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's do that DNA test right now. Let's go do it right this minute.</font>

736
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:36,220
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'm sorry.</font>

737
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:38,970
<font color="yellow">You're going through trouble because of me.</font>

738
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:42,384
<font color="yellow">Why should you feel sorry? I should be the sorrier one.</font>

739
00:56:42,644 --> 00:56:44,377
<font color="yellow">Why should you feel sorry?</font>

740
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:46,931
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault that you're like this.</font>

741
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:50,465
<font color="yellow">Would you have done this if I was happily married with Jang-go?</font>

742
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:52,661
<font color="yellow">This has nothing to do with that.</font>
