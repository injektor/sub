00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:12,683
<font color="yellow">- What about father?
- He's on a business trip in Busan
running an errand for Mr. Kim.</font>

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,378
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, who is coming today?</font>

5
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:25,105
<font color="yellow">She's the person who saved me
with CPR when I fainted last time.</font>

6
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:26,853
<font color="yellow">You know her, too.</font>

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,165
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

8
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:31,272
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae knows her?</font>

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,910
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

10
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:40,246
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

11
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:45,259
<font color="yellow">Hello. Welcome, Mi-poong.</font>

12
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:52,496
<font color="yellow">This skinny girl saved you?</font>

13
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:55,050
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's my savior.</font>

14
00:00:55,723 --> 00:01:02,009
<font color="yellow">If Mi-poong hadn't saved me,
I would be in heaven by now.</font>

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,332
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. How can this happen?</font>

16
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:10,666
<font color="yellow">Did they somehow connect with each other?
She saved her grandfather's life!</font>

17
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,619
<font color="yellow">So you were the one who
saved my grandfather, Mi-poong?</font>

18
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Welcome to our home.</font>

19
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:23,843
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed. I just did
something anyone would've done.</font>

20
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:26,569
<font color="yellow">Yet, you invited me
to your house. Thank you.</font>

21
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:31,331
<font color="yellow">Hello. You're Hee-ra's sister-in-law, right?
I met you at the wedding last time.</font>

22
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,391
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes! Hello!</font>

23
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,972
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that right?</font>

24
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:38,636
<font color="yellow">You're Hee-ra's sister-in-law?</font>

25
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:40,246
<font color="yellow">She is.</font>

26
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:45,706
<font color="yellow">Wow. You and I must have a deep connection.</font>

27
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:50,691
<font color="yellow">You knew Shin-ae in North Korea, too.
We're not strangers at all.</font>

28
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,949
<font color="yellow">Do you like the food?</font>

29
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:12,223
<font color="yellow">A famous hotel chef came and prepared it.</font>

30
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:15,479
<font color="yellow">Oh, no wonder! The food was so delicious that</font>

31
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:18,453
<font color="yellow">there were fireworks exploding in my mouth!</font>

32
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:20,470
<font color="yellow">They were like, "What's going on?"</font>

33
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:25,635
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're such a witty
and adorable young lady.</font>

34
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:29,049
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm married, I'm an old lady.</font>

35
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,107
<font color="yellow">- Old lady?
- Old lady?</font>

36
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,441
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,566
<font color="yellow">But when did you learn CPR?</font>

38
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:43,621
<font color="yellow">I learned it in Pyeongyang
when I was in college.</font>

39
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,448
<font color="yellow">You went to college in Pyeongyang?</font>

40
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:46,793
<font color="yellow">Which college?</font>

41
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,022
<font color="yellow">I majored in dancing at
Pyeongyang Arts University.</font>

42
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,497
<font color="yellow">Majored in dancing?</font>

43
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:53,092
<font color="yellow">But why aren't you doing work in that field?</font>

44
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:58,315
<font color="yellow">Because it's hard to make a living with
North Korean dancing in South Korea.</font>

45
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,838
<font color="yellow">And I forgot about it all now.</font>

46
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,719
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.
You must have suffered through a lot.</font>

47
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:10,629
<font color="yellow">But during winter,
what do people in North Korea eat?</font>

48
00:03:11,073 --> 00:03:12,473
<font color="yellow">It's similar to here.</font>

49
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:15,973
<font color="yellow">We eat bean-curd dregs stew
and bean-curd dregs rice.</font>

50
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,870
<font color="yellow">Bean-curd dregs rice?</font>

51
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:25,572
<font color="yellow">I used to eat a lot of bean-curd
dregs rice when I was in North Korea.</font>

52
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:30,065
<font color="yellow">My grandmother loved bean-curd
dregs rice, so I used to eat it a lot, too.</font>

53
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:31,878
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

54
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,562
<font color="yellow">Is your grandmother in North Korea?</font>

55
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,370
<font color="yellow">My grandmother-</font>

56
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,838
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my!
- Hey!</font>

57
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,215
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you okay?</font>

58
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,970
<font color="yellow">- What will you do?
- I lost my wrist strength.</font>

59
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:47,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. My wrist isn't well these days.</font>

60
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,596
<font color="yellow">Maid.</font>

61
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,524
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

62
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,283
<font color="yellow">Once I'm done eating,
bring the tea to my room.</font>

63
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,346
<font color="yellow">I have to talk with Mi-poong privately.</font>

64
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:02,948
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

65
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:11,253
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

66
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:14,989
<font color="yellow">I'll go wipe my clothes.</font>

67
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,378
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, eat some more.
That way, Mi-poong will eat more.</font>

68
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,355
<font color="yellow">No, I'm done eating.</font>

69
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:29,307
<font color="yellow">- You should eat more.
- No. Don't push yourself.</font>

70
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:32,399
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't get sick from overeating.</font>

71
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,580
<font color="yellow">Right. Thank you.</font>

72
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:38,573
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's go to my room.</font>

73
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,564
<font color="yellow">Sure. Thank you for the meal.</font>

74
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:54,648
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

75
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,500
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to go up.
- Okay.</font>

76
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:12,093
<font color="yellow">What kind of secrets are they sharing
that they have to go into his room?</font>

77
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:15,994
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing?
Why are you guys secretly</font>

78
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,290
<font color="yellow">making eye-contact? What are you up to now?</font>

79
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:22,475
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you talking about?
When did we secretly make eye-contact?</font>

80
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,169
<font color="yellow">It's not like we're secret lovers.</font>

81
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:33,181
<font color="yellow">- Shin-ae, take the tea inside.
- Yes, mother!</font>

82
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,166
<font color="yellow">Please give it to me.</font>

83
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,180
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, drink the green tea.
You, too, Mi-poong.</font>

84
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:49,586
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae,</font>

85
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:56,883
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to Mi-poong privately,
so can you go outside?</font>

86
00:05:58,165 --> 00:05:59,365
<font color="yellow">Sure, grandfather.</font>

87
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:01,995
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead and talk.
- Okay.</font>

88
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,781
<font color="yellow">- Did you eat well?
- Yes, the food was very delicious.</font>

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,414
<font color="yellow">What does he need to tell her that
he told you to go outside? What do we do?</font>

90
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:23,836
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

91
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:30,467
<font color="yellow">Stop your rebel meeting. Come here
and eat some fruit. The pear is very sweet.</font>

92
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,329
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

93
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:42,415
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

94
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,472
<font color="yellow">You saved my life.</font>

95
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:50,438
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I should just
sit by and do nothing.</font>

96
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,434
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's not a big amount.</font>

97
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,805
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as pocket money
I'm giving you.</font>

98
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,758
<font color="yellow">No, Mr. Kim!</font>

99
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,328
<font color="yellow">It's my heart.</font>

100
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:06,383
<font color="yellow">No, I'm just grateful you
invited me to your house. I mean it.</font>

101
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:08,024
<font color="yellow">Accept it.</font>

102
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,700
<font color="yellow">That way I'll feel comfortable.</font>

103
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,554
<font color="yellow">How about you buy me a lot of delicious
meals later on instead? You can just do that.</font>

104
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:19,008
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

105
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:25,843
<font color="yellow">Then how many meals do I have to buy?</font>

106
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,250
<font color="yellow">You can buy me many, many meals and coffee.</font>

107
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,804
<font color="yellow">All right then.</font>

108
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:36,406
<font color="yellow">Let's do that.</font>

109
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:42,797
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

110
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,133
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

111
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,477
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

112
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:56,538
<font color="yellow">Where did it go? Chung-ja! Shin-ae!</font>

113
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,172
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

114
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,154
<font color="yellow">My ring! Where did my ring go?</font>

115
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,562
<font color="yellow">Huh? Your ring?</font>

116
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:10,430
<font color="yellow">Yes, my ring! My ring in the frame!</font>

117
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,777
<font color="yellow">Where else would it be? It's in your room.</font>

118
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,709
<font color="yellow">It's not there! That's why I'm doing this!</font>

119
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,391
<font color="yellow">Did you remove the ring in
the frame in Mr. Kim's room?</font>

120
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:27,117
<font color="yellow">No! Isn't that on top of the table?</font>

121
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:29,648
<font color="yellow">I didn't touch it!</font>

122
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,023
<font color="yellow">I'll look for it!</font>

123
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:37,133
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

124
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,405
<font color="yellow">What kind of ring is it?</font>

125
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,038
<font color="yellow">Well, it's-</font>

126
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:45,094
<font color="yellow">Go and do your job.</font>

127
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,336
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

128
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,406
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I think you should leave.</font>

129
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:01,091
<font color="yellow">- The situation is pretty bad right now.
- Okay.</font>

130
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:03,836
<font color="yellow">I won't escort you out. Go home safe.</font>

131
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:07,719
<font color="yellow">But I think I should say good-bye
to Mr. Kim and the other adults.</font>

132
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,293
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to them. Don't worry about it.</font>

133
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,641
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

134
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:24,008
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear! Where did it go?</font>

135
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,966
<font color="yellow">Did anyone come into my room?</font>

136
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,789
<font color="yellow">Nope!</font>

137
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:30,453
<font color="yellow">Only the maid and I came to clean in here.</font>

138
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,790
<font color="yellow">This is very strange indeed!</font>

139
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,219
<font color="yellow">For sure I saw that it was here!</font>

140
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:43,441
<font color="yellow">You still haven't found it yet?
When was the last time you saw it?</font>

141
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:48,086
<font color="yellow">I saw it this morning for sure!</font>

142
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,016
<font color="yellow">Oh! Here it is!</font>

143
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:53,277
<font color="yellow">- It's right here!
- Where?</font>

144
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:57,563
<font color="yellow">- It was right here all along.
- Where? Where?</font>

145
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,830
<font color="yellow">It wasn't there when I was looking for it.</font>

146
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,970
<font color="yellow">Goodness. The maid must have left it under the</font>

147
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:11,235
<font color="yellow">blanket on accident while
she was cleaning the room.</font>

148
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,583
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't let the maid clean my room!</font>

149
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

150
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:21,268
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, I'll clean your room
from now on, so don't worry about it.</font>

151
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:24,732
<font color="yellow">Okay, I think that would be best.</font>

152
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:29,453
<font color="yellow">Hold on. What about Mi-poong?</font>

153
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:33,461
<font color="yellow">She left a while ago.</font>

154
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:38,422
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. She must have left
because of the commotion.</font>

155
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:44,359
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad when I invited her over.</font>

156
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,757
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
It seemed like she had other plans.</font>

157
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,204
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

158
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,408
<font color="yellow">But what ring was it?</font>

159
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,562
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm here.</font>

160
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,172
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

161
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:23,883
<font color="yellow">What about Young-soon and Chung-ja?</font>

162
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:26,455
<font color="yellow">Young-soon is almost here, and Chung-ja can't</font>

163
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,549
<font color="yellow">make it. She has something going on at home.</font>

164
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:29,574
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

165
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,444
<font color="yellow">But did something good happen to Young-soon?</font>

166
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:34,874
<font color="yellow">Why is she suddenly offering to buy a meal?</font>

167
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,010
<font color="yellow">Young-soon's son is getting married.</font>

168
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:41,082
<font color="yellow">She's so happy because her daughter-in-law
is the daughter of a hospital director.</font>

169
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:42,766
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

170
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,211
<font color="yellow">- I'm here.
- Hi.</font>

171
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,903
<font color="yellow">We were wondering when you would be here. But</font>

172
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:49,420
<font color="yellow">Young-soon, that mink coat is so beautiful!</font>

173
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,772
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law gave it to me as
a wedding present along with this bag.</font>

174
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:56,859
<font color="yellow">Your fate completely changed,
thanks to your wealthy daughter-in-law.</font>

175
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,097
<font color="yellow">This won't do. The smell of
meat will get on my mink coat.</font>

176
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:02,784
<font color="yellow">I'm going to put it in the car.
Go ahead and order.</font>

177
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,347
<font color="yellow">But her son is a health trainer.</font>

178
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:14,414
<font color="yellow">How did he end up marrying the
daughter of a hospital director?</font>

179
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:17,344
<font color="yellow">He met her while helping her
work out at the gym.</font>

180
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:22,397
<font color="yellow">As a wedding gift, her daughter-in-law gave
a foreign car and an apartment to her son.</font>

181
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:27,665
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, to be honest, I thought
your son would end up with the best life.</font>

182
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,873
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that? They just
have to live happily from now on.</font>

183
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:33,320
<font color="yellow">Let's just order meat.</font>

184
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:39,330
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil. Geum-sil.</font>

185
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:40,355
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

186
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,437
<font color="yellow">Isn't that your in-law over there?</font>

187
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,820
<font color="yellow">Does your in-law work here?</font>

188
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:55,950
<font color="yellow">No! She doesn't!</font>

189
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:59,754
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I forgot I had urgent plans.</font>

190
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,997
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'll be leaving first. Enjoy the food.</font>

191
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:04,618
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil!</font>

192
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,639
<font color="yellow">Young-soon, you should have
just pretended you didn't notice!</font>

193
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

194
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,712
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I'm so humiliated!</font>

195
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:30,000
<font color="yellow">I'd rather shave my head and
enter the mountains than endure this!</font>

196
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:37,556
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

197
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,736
<font color="yellow">Mom, what should I make for dinner?</font>

198
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,828
<font color="yellow">Should I make kimchi stew with pork?</font>

199
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:49,977
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

200
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,063
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,196
<font color="yellow">I want to live without seeing you.</font>

202
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,893
<font color="yellow">I even hate seeing your heels!</font>

203
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:02,195
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

204
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:04,714
<font color="yellow">I hate your mother! I hate you, too!</font>

205
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:08,386
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to get sick
just looking at you.</font>

206
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:15,634
<font color="yellow">Can't you just leave Jang-go alone
and take your family out of my house?</font>

207
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,516
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm sorry.</font>

208
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:22,147
<font color="yellow">I'll do better from now on.
I'll make more of an effort.</font>

209
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:24,635
<font color="yellow">I never told you to do better!</font>

210
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,415
<font color="yellow">I tried holding it in for the sake of
Jang-go, but I really can't do this.</font>

211
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,055
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

212
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,151
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out of this room!</font>

213
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,977
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see your face!
Hurry up and get out!</font>

214
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:44,579
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get out!</font>

215
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:56,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What's all this?</font>

216
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,337
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

217
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:01,736
<font color="yellow">I can't live!</font>

218
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:29,433
<font color="yellow">What about Hee-dong?</font>

219
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,291
<font color="yellow">He's working in the other room.</font>

220
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

221
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,996
<font color="yellow">I'm so nervous I could die.</font>

222
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:42,869
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, the girl who came earlier,
is working at</font>

223
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:47,033
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim's company,
and she's the sister-in-law of Hee-ra.</font>

224
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:50,876
<font color="yellow">It's only a matter of time before
it's revealed that you're an imposter!</font>

225
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:52,959
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

226
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,853
<font color="yellow">As long as you and I keep our mouths shut,</font>

227
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:57,908
<font color="yellow">we'll be fine, so why do
you keep saying such things?</font>

228
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:01,848
<font color="yellow">The only thing we can do
is send Mi-poong and her</font>

229
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:05,222
<font color="yellow">family far away to a place
where we can't see them.</font>

230
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,985
<font color="yellow">First, chase her out of the company
using whatever method you can.</font>

231
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:12,853
<font color="yellow">That way, Mi-poong and Mr. Kim won't meet up.</font>

232
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,398
<font color="yellow">I know. That's why I entered the company.</font>

233
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:19,798
<font color="yellow">All right. Do whatever
you can to chase her out.</font>

234
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:24,092
<font color="yellow">I’ll do whatever I can to make her
leave Geum-sil's house.</font>

235
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,865
<font color="yellow">That's the only way we'll be able to live!</font>

236
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:35,149
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I'm here!</font>

237
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,345
<font color="yellow">I knew you would be like this.</font>

238
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,034
<font color="yellow">Why are you here again?</font>

239
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,200
<font color="yellow">If you're here to put salt
on my wounds, just leave.</font>

240
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,667
<font color="yellow">I just came to visit you. That's all.</font>

241
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:51,590
<font color="yellow">Here. Have some sweet red bean porridge.</font>

242
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,641
<font color="yellow">I'll eat it later.</font>

243
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,786
<font color="yellow">I don't have an appetite right now.</font>

244
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,823
<font color="yellow">Young-soon called me.</font>

245
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:04,613
<font color="yellow">You guys met at a rib restaurant
yesterday, but you left without eating.</font>

246
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:11,642
<font color="yellow">Why is your in-law
working there of all places?</font>

247
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,959
<font color="yellow">My head hurts, so don't even bring that up.</font>

248
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:18,857
<font color="yellow">It would have been wonderful if your son had</font>

249
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:21,660
<font color="yellow">gotten married to the
daughter of that law firm.</font>

250
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,002
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Are you crying?</font>

251
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,013
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

252
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:35,169
<font color="yellow">I just start tearing up for no reason at all.</font>

253
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,076
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking about Ha-yeon.</font>

254
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,130
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon?</font>

255
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,640
<font color="yellow">The daughter of that law firm?</font>

256
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,629
<font color="yellow">I got attached to her. I miss her.</font>

257
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,352
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

258
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:56,104
<font color="yellow">But is your new daughter-in-law that terrible?</font>

259
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,049
<font color="yellow">I don't want to even look at her.</font>

260
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,312
<font color="yellow">Either they move out or I shave my head
and move into the mountains.</font>

261
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,505
<font color="yellow">I can't live with her.</font>

262
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:12,942
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why would you leave?
You should kick her out.</font>

263
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:14,529
<font color="yellow">Kick her out?</font>

264
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,794
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

265
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,689
<font color="yellow">Even if I tell her to leave,
she says she'll do better</font>

266
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,068
<font color="yellow">and sticks to this house like a leech.</font>

267
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,364
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! You'll get ill with anger!</font>

268
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:26,552
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

269
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:34,779
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, should I teach you the method
to chase your daughter-in-law out of here?</font>

270
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,505
<font color="yellow">Method? What method?</font>

271
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,538
<font color="yellow">Jang-go loves her so much,
so how will I be able to do that?</font>

272
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,732
<font color="yellow">If you really want to chase her out,</font>

273
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:51,247
<font color="yellow">you should make her quit her job first.</font>

274
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,051
<font color="yellow">Make her quit her job?</font>

275
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,919
<font color="yellow">Yes! That way, you'll be able to
keep her home and give her a hard time!</font>

276
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:09,233
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you all you need to know in
order to chase your daughter-in-law out.</font>

277
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:17,677
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

278
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:37,604
<font color="yellow">What will I do with her?</font>

279
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,950
<font color="yellow">She's here. She's there. She's everywhere!</font>

<font color="yellow">(Director Park Shin-ae)</font>

281
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,771
<font color="yellow">I need to give Hee-ra a store?</font>

282
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:50,966
<font color="yellow">Yes, right now!</font>

283
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:55,048
<font color="yellow">If we want to make Mi-poong quit this
company and chase her out of her house,</font>

be the only one to do the housework!</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes. My friend Geum-sil will do
anything to get rid of Mi-poong.</font>

00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,485
<font color="yellow">and you come up with
an issue to blame her with,</font>

296
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,629
<font color="yellow">she won't be able to endure anymore
and she'll leave the company.</font>

297
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,052
<font color="yellow">So hurry up and give a store to Hee-ra!</font>

298
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:43,371
<font color="yellow">You're a director now. You have
enough power to do that. Come on. Here.</font>

299
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:45,473
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

300
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,762
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, this is really your store?</font>

301
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:11,278
<font color="yellow">Yes. After my training, I'll become
the owner of this store next week!</font>

302
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,761
<font color="yellow">That's great!</font>

303
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:17,098
<font color="yellow">This is all thanks to my mom and Shin-ae.</font>

304
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,028
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Chung-ja.</font>

305
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,075
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

306
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:29,179
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything. Thank you for loving</font>

307
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:33,193
<font color="yellow">my daughter as your own. Thank you so much.</font>

308
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,723
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

309
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:40,022
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Jang-soo!</font>

310
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,684
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- Oh, come on!</font>

311
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,871
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo! Thank your mother-in-law first!</font>

312
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
<font color="yellow">Hello, mother!</font>

313
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

314
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:59,207
<font color="yellow">Run this store well and succeed.</font>

315
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:03,809
<font color="yellow">Next spring, you can have an official wedding.</font>

316
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:08,662
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you serious?</font>

317
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,777
<font color="yellow">Yes, but if this business goes under,
you'll get nothing!</font>

318
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:17,621
<font color="yellow">That'll never happen! Never!</font>

319
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:23,730
<font color="yellow">Thank you, mother!</font>

320
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,579
<font color="yellow">We'll do our best!</font>

321
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo!</font>

322
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:32,387
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

323
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:41,246
<font color="yellow">The store was so big, clean, and nice!</font>

324
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,033
<font color="yellow">The location is so great
that business will go well!</font>

325
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,807
<font color="yellow">When business goes well
and I make a lot of money,</font>

326
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,176
<font color="yellow">I'll give it all to you, mother and grandma!</font>

327
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,707
<font color="yellow">Don't even lie like that.</font>

328
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,152
<font color="yellow">I'm serious!</font>

329
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,121
<font color="yellow">Manage the business well
so that it doesn't go under.</font>

330
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,754
<font color="yellow">That way, you'll be able to
have a wedding next spring.</font>

331
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

332
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,277
<font color="yellow">People without their in-law's
connections will be so sad.</font>

333
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:08,582
<font color="yellow">Hey. Are you talking about me?</font>

334
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:13,618
<font color="yellow">Don't blame me. Blame your fate.</font>

335
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:18,871
<font color="yellow">Since we have good in-laws,
they gave us a store.</font>

336
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,707
<font color="yellow">They're supporting us so that we don't
have to worry about their daughter's living.</font>

337
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:25,539
<font color="yellow">That's why everyone is
bragging about their in-laws.</font>

338
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:31,973
<font color="yellow">I was worried because Jang-soo didn't
have a proper job. Now I can relax a bit.</font>

339
00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:34,872
<font color="yellow">Geez, mom. Why worry about me?</font>

340
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,863
<font color="yellow">We lived well so far.</font>

341
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:42,326
<font color="yellow">And I'm going to succeed, so don't you worry!</font>

342
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,871
<font color="yellow">Gosh. All you do is boast.</font>

343
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:49,405
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make a lot of money from now on</font>

344
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,138
<font color="yellow">and take care of Jang-soo, so don't you worry!</font>

345
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:53,605
<font color="yellow">- Thanks.
- All right then.</font>

346
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,446
<font color="yellow">This is all thanks to your family, so be good</font>

347
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,044
<font color="yellow">to your parents. Jang-soo,
be good to your in-laws.</font>

348
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:01,309
<font color="yellow">Yes, I got it.</font>

349
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,270
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go,</font>

350
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:08,543
<font color="yellow">you quit working for Jang & Ko Law Firm.</font>

351
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:11,431
<font color="yellow">For how much longer
will you waste your life away?</font>

352
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:13,379
<font color="yellow">What do you mean waste my life away?</font>

353
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:15,933
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work at my friend's office.</font>

354
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,508
<font color="yellow">Really? That's great!</font>

355
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,941
<font color="yellow">Come on, mother. How is that great?</font>

356
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,755
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even have his own office. He has to</font>

357
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,030
<font color="yellow">walk on eggshells in someone else's office.</font>

358
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:30,277
<font color="yellow">Obviously, he won't be able to make any money.</font>

359
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:32,895
<font color="yellow">But that all becomes experience.</font>

360
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,575
<font color="yellow">When will he be able to settle down?</font>

361
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:40,014
<font color="yellow">That's why I told him that
he needs good in-laws.</font>

362
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:41,793
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

363
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:48,191
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're embarrassing Mi-poong.
How can you say that right in front of her?</font>

364
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,347
<font color="yellow">I don't even meet my friends lately.</font>

365
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,511
<font color="yellow">Do you know why?</font>

366
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,387
<font color="yellow">Everyone says that Jang-go
is a waste. That they thought Jang-go</font>

367
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:04,519
<font color="yellow">would turn out the best. That he
met in-laws who leech off of him.</font>

368
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,975
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if you hears such things?</font>

369
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:15,582
<font color="yellow">I want to talk nicely, but I can't.</font>

370
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:48,394
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

371
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:50,751
<font color="yellow">What's on your mind?</font>

372
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,191
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

373
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,574
<font color="yellow">Is it because of what my mom said earlier?</font>

374
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:58,154
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

375
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,190
<font color="yellow">What's with that expression?</font>

376
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:05,021
<font color="yellow">Don't you trust me?</font>

377
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:08,915
<font color="yellow">I can go work at my friend's
office and settle down quickly.</font>

378
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:13,849
<font color="yellow">My mom won't be so upset
after she sees me settle down.</font>

379
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:14,996
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

380
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,558
<font color="yellow">All right. I trust you.</font>

381
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:23,926
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

382
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:25,592
<font color="yellow">I need to speak to you.</font>

383
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:39,594
<font color="yellow">I'll get straight to the point.</font>

384
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:43,068
<font color="yellow">You heard that I became the
owner of a fashion store, right?</font>

385
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:45,957
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

386
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,300
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll be very busy
from early morning to late at night.</font>

387
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:57,980
<font color="yellow">So don't make me tired with household chores
like making meals and doing the cleaning.</font>

388
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,021
<font color="yellow">That's what I had to tell you.</font>

389
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:01,949
<font color="yellow">Listen, Hee-ra.</font>

390
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:05,369
<font color="yellow">I go to work early in the morning
and come home late at night,</font>

391
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:07,801
<font color="yellow">too. Yet, I'm trying my best
to help with the housework.</font>

392
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:10,769
<font color="yellow">Tell that to mother.</font>

393
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:15,652
<font color="yellow">She told me to not worry about the
housework and just focus on the store.</font>

394
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:20,024
<font color="yellow">So from now on, discuss the
housework with mother and not me.</font>

395
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:21,652
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

396
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:27,121
<font color="yellow">That brat!</font>

397
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:29,542
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

398
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,253
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Come see me.</font>

399
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,042
<font color="yellow">Quit your job.</font>

400
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:47,605
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

401
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,574
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

402
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,872
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra is going to be in
charge of the store now.</font>

403
00:27:55,144 --> 00:28:01,893
<font color="yellow">That's why you should quit your job,
stay home, and take care of our family.</font>

404
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,224
<font color="yellow">Mother, I can't quit my job.</font>

405
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:08,465
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

406
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:14,498
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to take care of
both my working daughters-in-law?</font>

407
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:19,522
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm working,
but I'm doing the best that I can.</font>

408
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,839
<font color="yellow">Please tell Hee-ra that she and
I have to equally share the housework.</font>

409
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,355
<font color="yellow">If you help me out a little...</font>

410
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:28,239
<font color="yellow">How can you be so selfish?</font>

411
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:31,785
<font color="yellow">Are you and Hee-ra alike?</font>

412
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:38,316
<font color="yellow">Do you think your paycheck can even compare
with the money she makes at her store?</font>

413
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,652
<font color="yellow">All of us have to help her out.</font>

414
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:50,261
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You should be offering to quit
your work first. How can you be like this?</font>

415
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:54,535
<font color="yellow">Mother, I would like to work.</font>

416
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:56,339
<font color="yellow">Please allow me to.</font>

417
00:28:56,848 --> 00:29:00,741
<font color="yellow">It's the first official job I got ever
since I came here to South Korea.</font>

418
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:02,796
<font color="yellow">I don't want to quit now.</font>

419
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:07,988
<font color="yellow">Then what are you going
to do about the housework?</font>

420
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,777
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi goes out to work. I need
to go to Hee-ra's shop and help out.</font>

421
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,986
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to tell
my mother-in-law to do the housework?</font>

422
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:18,760
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

423
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:20,308
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

424
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,794
<font color="yellow">So please allow me to work.</font>

425
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,176
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

426
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:31,605
<font color="yellow">Then work and do all of
the housework by yourself.</font>

427
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,449
<font color="yellow">I was telling you to quit your job because
you might have a hard time doing both.</font>

428
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:40,894
<font color="yellow">But if you can do it,
then there's nothing I can do about it.</font>

429
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:44,160
<font color="yellow">I'm done talking. You can leave.</font>

430
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,613
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

431
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:55,702
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in the middle of the night?</font>

432
00:30:58,715 --> 00:31:02,503
<font color="yellow">I was making some side dishes
for tomorrow's breakfast.</font>

433
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:06,056
<font color="yellow">How can you only think of yourself?</font>

434
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:09,206
<font color="yellow">Everyone else is asleep.
If you make so much noise</font>

435
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:11,600
<font color="yellow">on that cutting board, they'll all wake up.</font>

436
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,921
<font color="yellow">Or are you doing this
so that the whole neighborhood</font>

437
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:19,116
<font color="yellow">will know I'm making you
work late into the night?</font>

438
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:23,259
<font color="yellow">That's not it. The mornings
are really busy. That's why...</font>

439
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,278
<font color="yellow">Then wake up early in
the morning and make them.</font>

440
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:29,801
<font color="yellow">If you make the side dishes now,
will they be good in the morning?</font>

441
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:33,246
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

442
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,452
<font color="yellow">How frustrating.</font>

443
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:54,191
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

444
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,128
<font color="yellow">What? Jung-geun's father?</font>

445
00:31:58,848 --> 00:31:59,848
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

446
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:02,513
<font color="yellow">I'll go to your house,
so let's carpool together.</font>

447
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,464
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

448
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,877
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, eat this, too.</font>

449
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,222
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Me, too.</font>

450
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:18,511
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

451
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,144
<font color="yellow">It's so delicious!</font>

452
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:23,753
<font color="yellow">Did someone pass away?</font>

453
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:27,280
<font color="yellow">Yes. My friend's father passed away.
I have to go to Yeosu.</font>

454
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:29,417
<font color="yellow">All the way to Yeosu?</font>

455
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:31,483
<font color="yellow">Then you won't be able to come home tonight.</font>

456
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:32,785
<font color="yellow">Probably not.</font>

457
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:34,998
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, I'll be back.</font>

458
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,167
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Be careful of cars!</font>

459
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:39,254
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Bye!</font>

460
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:40,925
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, be safe.</font>

461
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,956
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

462
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:54,612
<font color="yellow">Oh, my, Ms. Joo! You're here!</font>

463
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,402
<font color="yellow">Have all of you been well?</font>

464
00:32:57,262 --> 00:32:59,160
<font color="yellow">You must be working here again.</font>

465
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,228
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

466
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:04,288
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came! The regular customers from</font>

467
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:07,214
<font color="yellow">your home country have been looking for you!</font>

468
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,410
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Of course!</font>

469
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:16,488
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, you're here.</font>

470
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:18,598
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Jo.</font>

471
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,128
<font color="yellow">Hey, move.</font>

472
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,824
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

473
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,409
<font color="yellow">I was riding on the swings first.</font>

474
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:42,063
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and move!</font>

475
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:47,177
<font color="yellow">She must be a goat. She always does this.</font>

476
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:00,285
<font color="yellow">Hey, you guys!</font>

477
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:09,715
<font color="yellow">Why are you guys teasing
and bothering Yoo-jin?</font>

478
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:12,855
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin talks weirdly.</font>

479
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

480
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,677
<font color="yellow">Don't cry, Yoo-jin.</font>

481
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,134
<font color="yellow">You're not a goat.</font>

482
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:31,546
<font color="yellow">Last time I came, I told you about the bear
and chicken that traveled together, right?</font>

483
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,862
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

484
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:37,416
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you
when I was done reading the story?</font>

485
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:41,846
<font color="yellow">You told us to play nicely with our friends.</font>

486
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:43,926
<font color="yellow">All of you do remember.</font>

487
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,966
<font color="yellow">Even a bear and a chicken became friends.</font>

488
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:51,692
<font color="yellow">Should we tease and bother our friends
for speaking a little differently?</font>

489
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:53,309
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't.</font>

490
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:55,036
<font color="yellow">You guys are smart.</font>

491
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:59,778
<font color="yellow">I brought storybooks today, too.
Make sure you share them</font>

492
00:34:59,803 --> 00:35:02,909
<font color="yellow">with each other and
play nicely with Yoo-jin.</font>

493
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:04,547
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

494
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,683
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, I'm sorry.</font>

495
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,079
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, I'm sorry.</font>

496
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,503
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, I'm sorry.</font>

497
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:14,251
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

498
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,891
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, big brother!</font>

499
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:31,673
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

500
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:35,126
<font color="yellow">Thank you for earlier.</font>

501
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,836
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me "big brother?"</font>

502
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:48,034
<font color="yellow">You're handsome and cool,
so you're not an old man to me.</font>

503
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:49,462
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

504
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:55,463
<font color="yellow">I feel so happy that a pretty girl
like you called me her big brother.</font>

505
00:35:55,712 --> 00:36:00,860
<font color="yellow">But you really don't seem like an old man.
You seem like a big brother.</font>

506
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,739
<font color="yellow">Um, Hee-dong...</font>

507
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,485
<font color="yellow">Yes, Miss Yanbian?</font>

508
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:14,783
<font color="yellow">Can I call you when something
happens or when I miss you?</font>

509
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:16,521
<font color="yellow">Of course you can.</font>

510
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,909
<font color="yellow">Then give me your phone number.</font>

511
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:23,171
<font color="yellow">You have a cell-phone?</font>

512
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,399
<font color="yellow">Yes. My aunt bought it for me.</font>

513
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:28,337
<font color="yellow">You have an aunt?</font>

514
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:30,517
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

515
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:33,957
<font color="yellow">But that's a secret.</font>

516
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:36,157
<font color="yellow">Only you should know it.</font>

517
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:38,673
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

518
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:41,445
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't tell anyone.</font>

519
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:49,392
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

520
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:51,104
<font color="yellow">She can't quit her job?</font>

521
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,476
<font color="yellow">Yes. She said she can never quit her job.</font>

522
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:59,582
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, were you being too soft to her?</font>

523
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,594
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

524
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:06,180
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law
was like that at first, too.</font>

525
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:09,554
<font color="yellow">She said she would never leave
as long as she was alive.</font>

526
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:11,344
<font color="yellow">She would leave when she was dead.</font>

527
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,829
<font color="yellow">She really said that?</font>

528
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:14,016
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

529
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:16,423
<font color="yellow">I was so appalled back then.</font>

530
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:22,148
<font color="yellow">Eventually, she left. She was a stubborn one.
Your daughter-in-law will leave, too.</font>

531
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,485
<font color="yellow">But my daughter-in-law is stubborn, too.</font>

532
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:30,063
<font color="yellow">She was making side dishes
at two in the morning.</font>

533
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,383
<font color="yellow">That's why I told her to
make them early morning.</font>

534
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:37,285
<font color="yellow">I don't know how she did it, but she managed
to prepare everything in the morning.</font>

535
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,055
<font color="yellow">My goodness. She's not a normal one either.</font>

536
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:43,282
<font color="yellow">If you told her to quit, she should quit.</font>

537
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:46,633
<font color="yellow">She must think you were easy.</font>

538
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,585
<font color="yellow">Make her quit her job and
force her to do the housework.</font>

539
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,782
<font color="yellow">That's the only way she'll leave.</font>

540
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:57,470
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, my family is different from yours.</font>

541
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,394
<font color="yellow">If she can't do the dishes because she's busy,
then my mother-in-law does it for her.</font>

542
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,313
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, Nam-yi helps her, too.</font>

543
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:07,008
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

544
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:12,594
<font color="yellow">send all the women in the house to the
hot springs for two nights and three days...</font>

545
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,158
<font color="yellow">and force your daughter-in-law to make kimchi
with a hundred cabbages to exhaust her.</font>

546
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:21,884
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

547
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,406
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is away at a funeral and
won't be able to come home either.</font>

548
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,071
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

549
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:39,071
<font color="yellow">Hi, Geum-sil.</font>

550
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:41,173
<font color="yellow">Hot springs?</font>

551
00:38:41,495 --> 00:38:45,507
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hee-ra's mother made reservations
at a nice hot springs for us.</font>

552
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:47,165
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

553
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:52,495
<font color="yellow">I wasn't feeling well anyways, and I wanted
to dip my body into hot water, too.</font>

554
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:57,969
<font color="yellow">But it will be for two nights
and three days. Will that be all right?</font>

555
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:00,501
<font color="yellow">Yes. Don't worry.</font>

556
00:39:01,978 --> 00:39:02,978
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

557
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:06,978
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's good.</font>

558
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,391
<font color="yellow">I'm going to relax at the hot springs
and organize my mind there.</font>

559
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:13,540
<font color="yellow">I should use this chance to quit, too.</font>

560
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:17,355
<font color="yellow">Were there many customers today?</font>

561
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:19,057
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

562
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:21,921
<font color="yellow">I wrote it in the book.</font>

563
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,821
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, I want to quit.</font>

564
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:29,946
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

565
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,118
<font color="yellow">What are you suddenly talking about?</font>

566
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:37,342
<font color="yellow">I told you to work with Geum-sil
who dresses so sophisticated.</font>

567
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:39,649
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

568
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,415
<font color="yellow">You were serious?</font>

569
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:46,532
<font color="yellow">Yes. Then I'm going home now.</font>

570
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,961
<font color="yellow">Why on earth are you doing this?</font>

571
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:51,231
<font color="yellow">If you  have a problem, you can just tell me.</font>

572
00:39:51,844 --> 00:39:56,711
<font color="yellow">I just think it would be the best
for the both of us if I quit right now.</font>

573
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,344
<font color="yellow">You don't like me either.</font>

574
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,191
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

575
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:04,547
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

576
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,101
<font color="yellow">Look here, Lee Nam-yi.</font>

577
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:10,126
<font color="yellow">Lee Nam-yi!</font>

578
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:11,517
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

579
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:22,071
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited!</font>

580
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:28,249
<font color="yellow">How long has it been since
we went to the hot springs?</font>

581
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:31,935
<font color="yellow">I know. Let's relax in
the hot water, eat delicious foods,</font>

582
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,810
<font color="yellow">and just forget about everything there!</font>

583
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:40,221
<font color="yellow">You can forget about everything. If I forget
at this age, I'm going to get dementia.</font>

584
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,376
<font color="yellow">- Oh, grandma!
- Oh, grandma!</font>

585
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:45,547
<font color="yellow">- Why isn't Geum-sil coming out?
- I know.</font>

586
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:46,803
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Mother!</font>

587
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,636
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What do I do?</font>

588
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:55,270
<font color="yellow">My friend's father passed away,
so I have to go the funeral.</font>

589
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,913
<font color="yellow">We feel bad about going by ourselves.</font>

590
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:03,797
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I can go with my friends next time.</font>

591
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:06,407
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, take care of mother
and have a good time.</font>

592
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:08,625
<font color="yellow">Okay. We'll be going then.</font>

593
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:10,169
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Be careful driving.</font>

594
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:12,023
<font color="yellow">- I will.
- Bye, mother!</font>

595
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:13,817
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye, mom.</font>

596
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,336
<font color="yellow">Bye, mother!</font>

597
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:20,025
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Have a good time!</font>

598
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,251
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

599
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,743
<font color="yellow">- It's so nice to go on a trip!
- I know!</font>

600
00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:41,184
<font color="yellow">Grandma, it's nice to go in a car, right?</font>

601
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,906
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, did you bring the flower cards?</font>

602
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:47,137
<font color="yellow">Flower cards? No, I didn't.</font>

603
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:51,047
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I brought them. You always
want to play flower cards on a trip.</font>

604
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:55,055
<font color="yellow">Playing flower cards on
a trip is the most fun!</font>

605
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,439
<font color="yellow">I can't stop you.</font>

606
00:41:56,464 --> 00:41:57,727
<font color="yellow">Don't stop me.</font>

607
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,618
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, it's heavy, right?</font>

608
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:14,063
<font color="yellow">No. I'm strong, so it's not heavy at all.</font>

609
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:15,204
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

610
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:16,422
<font color="yellow">I'm okay, too.</font>

611
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:19,876
<font color="yellow">I'm not tired at all
because you're helping me.</font>

612
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,744
<font color="yellow">- You mean it?
- Of course I do!</font>

613
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:32,922
<font color="yellow">Wow! There are so many cabbages!</font>

614
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:35,649
<font color="yellow">Are these all yours?</font>

615
00:42:37,415 --> 00:42:39,615
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's a mountain of cabbages!</font>

616
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,517
<font color="yellow">Amazing!</font>

617
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:48,059
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, put that over there and go home.</font>

618
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:51,449
<font color="yellow">I'll make you yummy food soon. Okay?</font>

619
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:52,689
<font color="yellow">Okay, aunt.</font>

620
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:09,868
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

621
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:13,508
<font color="yellow">Hi. Did you buy the white radishes?</font>

622
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:15,642
<font color="yellow">Yes, mother.</font>

623
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:19,024
<font color="yellow">But there are a lot of cabbages...</font>

624
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:23,393
<font color="yellow">That's not a lot.
There are only a hundred of them.</font>

625
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:25,341
<font color="yellow">A hundred of them?</font>

626
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:29,883
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, my mother-in-law, Nam-yi,
Jang-soo, and Hee-ra went to the hot springs.</font>

627
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:37,766
<font color="yellow">I'm not feeling very well, so go
ahead and make the kimchi by yourself.</font>

628
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:42,063
<font color="yellow">Do I make all one hundred
cabbages into kimchi?</font>

629
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,337
<font color="yellow">Is that too much?</font>

630
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:50,688
<font color="yellow">I used to make a 100 cabbages
into kimchi all by myself.</font>

631
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,219
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, I would make
150 cabbages into kimchi, too.</font>

632
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:56,545
<font color="yellow">We need that much for all of
our family members to eat.</font>

633
00:43:57,642 --> 00:43:59,403
<font color="yellow">Why? You can't do it?</font>

634
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:06,993
<font color="yellow">First, split the cabbage leaves
and preserve them in salt.</font>

635
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:25,204
<font color="yellow">Good. Are you sick, Yoo-jin?</font>

636
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:27,321
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

637
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,184
<font color="yellow">Aren't you having a hard time there?</font>

638
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:32,290
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

639
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:37,954
<font color="yellow">Besides, you'll come pick
me up soon, so I can handle it.</font>

640
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,105
<font color="yellow">You're a good girl, Yoo-jin.</font>

641
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,437
<font color="yellow">Aunt, if I really wait six months...</font>

642
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,021
<font color="yellow">if I really wait 150 days...</font>

643
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,479
<font color="yellow">will we really be able to live together?</font>

644
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:51,845
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

645
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:54,282
<font color="yellow">So don't forget what I told you.</font>

646
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,512
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't tell anyone about you.</font>

647
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,032
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

648
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:02,219
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

649
00:45:03,274 --> 00:45:05,759
<font color="yellow">Who were you talking with?
Did you hang up because of me?</font>

650
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:07,809
<font color="yellow">No, I had something to discuss with Mr. Yang.</font>

651
00:45:08,024 --> 00:45:09,711
<font color="yellow">- I'm done talking.
- You are?</font>

652
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,954
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, guess what I bought?</font>

653
00:45:15,204 --> 00:45:16,204
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

654
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:17,229
<font color="yellow">Guess.</font>

655
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,718
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

656
00:45:20,032 --> 00:45:21,099
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes.</font>

657
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:28,414
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes.</font>

658
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:34,024
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! What are these?</font>

659
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:36,126
<font color="yellow">Baby shoes.</font>

660
00:45:37,282 --> 00:45:39,196
<font color="yellow">They're so adorable!</font>

661
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:41,118
<font color="yellow">But they're pink.</font>

662
00:45:42,634 --> 00:45:44,438
<font color="yellow">I was hoping we could have a daughter.</font>

663
00:45:44,751 --> 00:45:46,218
<font color="yellow">Do you like daughters?</font>

664
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:51,014
<font color="yellow">I like both daughters and sons,
but I changed my mind today.</font>

665
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,131
<font color="yellow">I really want a daughter
like that little girl.</font>

666
00:45:55,734 --> 00:45:56,734
<font color="yellow">Little girl?</font>

667
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,327
<font color="yellow">Actually, I go to orphanages
sometimes to collect information.</font>

668
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,568
<font color="yellow">One little girl called me her big brother.</font>

669
00:46:04,603 --> 00:46:06,463
<font color="yellow">It was so cute that I almost went crazy.</font>

670
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:08,773
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

671
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:15,145
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, can we have a pretty daughter?</font>

672
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:21,149
<font color="yellow">That's not up to me.</font>

673
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

674
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:47,306
<font color="yellow">All in.</font>

675
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:51,223
<font color="yellow">All in. Accepted.</font>

676
00:46:53,931 --> 00:46:54,931
<font color="yellow">I'm dead.</font>

677
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,889
<font color="yellow">Heukssal. Same thing.</font>

678
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,856
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. You're in a hurry.</font>

679
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:07,309
<font color="yellow">I got jangttang.</font>

680
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:10,986
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- What the hell!</font>

681
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,101
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much!</font>

682
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,962
<font color="yellow">It was a fun game today.</font>

683
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,678
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?</font>

684
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,987
<font color="yellow">Wait until I come back.</font>

685
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,666
<font color="yellow">You're going to get more money?</font>

686
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,151
<font color="yellow">I'm busy today.</font>

687
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:24,478
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

688
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,462
<font color="yellow">You better not go.</font>

689
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:39,067
<font color="yellow">Come back again.</font>

690
00:47:41,723 --> 00:47:44,012
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong said she can't quit her job?</font>

691
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:47,119
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's why she sent
her family to the hot springs</font>

692
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:49,815
<font color="yellow">and forced her to make
kimchi out of a 100 cabbages!</font>

693
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,121
<font color="yellow">Anyways, she won't be
able to come to work tomorrow.</font>

694
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:56,801
<font color="yellow">Can't you fire people for
skipping work to make kimchi?</font>

695
00:47:57,246 --> 00:47:59,680
<font color="yellow">You can't fire people so easily these days.</font>

696
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:03,879
<font color="yellow">Why can't you just fire people as you please?</font>

697
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,543
<font color="yellow">Anyways, now that Geum-sil
has made up her mind,</font>

698
00:48:08,879 --> 00:48:12,176
<font color="yellow">she'll force Mi-poong to quit her job somehow.</font>

699
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:14,810
<font color="yellow">But you never know what will happen.</font>

700
00:48:15,442 --> 00:48:18,109
<font color="yellow">Did you find out a way to get her fired?</font>

701
00:48:20,504 --> 00:48:21,684
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

702
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:24,348
<font color="yellow">Mom, you scared me! Knock, will you?</font>

703
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:27,730
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, you were here, too. Good.</font>

704
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:31,363
<font color="yellow">Where are you coming from?
What's with your face?</font>

705
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:32,926
<font color="yellow">Did something happen outside?</font>

706
00:48:33,317 --> 00:48:34,668
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae. Chung-ja.</font>

707
00:48:35,426 --> 00:48:37,863
<font color="yellow">Give me $20,000.</font>

708
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:41,692
<font color="yellow">$20,000?</font>

709
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,043
<font color="yellow">Yes. Right this instant.</font>

710
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:47,067
<font color="yellow">Mom, I haven't seen you all day.</font>

711
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,963
<font color="yellow">Were you doing this again?</font>

712
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,941
<font color="yellow">Are you going to give it to me or not?</font>

713
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:55,703
<font color="yellow">If you won't, I'll go to Mr. Kim.</font>

714
00:48:56,293 --> 00:48:57,652
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

715
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:00,523
<font color="yellow">When you get his inheritance later, you'll be</font>

716
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:03,315
<font color="yellow">able to spend as much
as you want before you die.</font>

717
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,740
<font color="yellow">Then what about me?</font>

718
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:08,355
<font color="yellow">So give me some money right now.
That way it'll be fair.</font>

719
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:12,898
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's wrong with you?</font>

720
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,152
<font color="yellow">Fine then.</font>

721
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:20,809
<font color="yellow">If you guys won't give me money,
I'll just go to Mr. Kim.</font>

722
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:23,348
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim!</font>

723
00:49:23,373 --> 00:49:24,973
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Grandmother!</font>

724
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:25,998
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim!</font>

725
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:28,230
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Mr. Kim!</font>

726
00:49:28,653 --> 00:49:29,653
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim!</font>

727
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:32,364
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

728
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:36,365
<font color="yellow">The thing is, I...</font>

729
00:49:36,636 --> 00:49:39,308
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong? Go ahead and tell me.</font>

730
00:49:39,473 --> 00:49:41,184
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, Mr. Kim.</font>

731
00:49:41,426 --> 00:49:43,199
<font color="yellow">- The thing is...
- Mom.</font>

732
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,984
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Why won't you let her speak?</font>

733
00:49:47,848 --> 00:49:48,848
<font color="yellow">Please tell me.</font>

734
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:53,019
<font color="yellow">I have something to ask you.</font>

735
00:49:55,097 --> 00:50:02,605
<font color="yellow">There's someone I know who sold balloon
flowers by lying that they were wild ginseng!</font>

736
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:07,479
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, what should I do in this case?</font>

737
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:10,051
<font color="yellow">It's someone I know really well.</font>

738
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:12,542
<font color="yellow">What else should you do?</font>

739
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:14,934
<font color="yellow">You must scold him.</font>

740
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,414
<font color="yellow">You should report it to the police.</font>

741
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:19,607
<font color="yellow">You can't let this slide just
because he's someone you know.</font>

742
00:50:19,632 --> 00:50:20,949
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

743
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:22,129
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

744
00:50:22,512 --> 00:50:27,128
<font color="yellow">That way, he'll never be able to do something
so terrible again. Then good night.</font>

745
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:29,807
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, good night.</font>

746
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:31,074
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

747
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:38,640
<font color="yellow">He wants me to report someone for
selling balloon flowers as wild ginseng.</font>

748
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,242
<font color="yellow">I wonder what he'll do when
he realizes you changed blood ties.</font>

749
00:50:42,574 --> 00:50:44,652
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you really going
to come out this way?</font>

750
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,419
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, I'll give that money to you.</font>

751
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:58,221
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Shin-ae! My granddaughter-in-law
is much better than my own daughter!</font>

752
00:51:00,004 --> 00:51:01,567
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

753
00:51:12,223 --> 00:51:13,887
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

754
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:16,782
<font color="yellow">Is she your biological mother?</font>

755
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:19,223
<font color="yellow">She is.</font>

756
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:23,152
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

757
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:26,361
<font color="yellow">she likes to play flower cards...</font>

758
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:30,465
<font color="yellow">No. She loves to play them.</font>

759
00:51:32,504 --> 00:51:33,715
<font color="yellow">Flower cards?</font>

760
00:51:34,644 --> 00:51:37,294
<font color="yellow">So she's doing this for gambling money?</font>

761
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:41,872
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, overlook this just once.</font>

762
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:46,207
<font color="yellow">Then I'll make sure this never happens again.</font>

763
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:52,019
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure she never gambles
or blackmails us again.</font>

764
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:57,643
<font color="yellow">So just help her out this once, okay?</font>

765
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:05,121
<font color="yellow">I can't live because of her.
I'm about to die here.</font>

766
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:09,581
<font color="yellow">- I'll finish up here.
- Bye.</font>

767
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,308
<font color="yellow">- Thanks!
- See you tomorrow.</font>

768
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:12,466
<font color="yellow">- See you tomorrow!
- Bye.</font>

769
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:29,346
<font color="yellow">Why is the light on in the office?</font>

770
00:52:40,114 --> 00:52:41,114
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

771
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:45,801
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Jo. You were still here.</font>

772
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,410
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go home now.</font>

773
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:51,393
<font color="yellow">Sure. Go on.</font>

774
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:55,507
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. It'll be hard for you to sew
that while you're still wearing your shirt.</font>

775
00:52:57,543 --> 00:52:59,899
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment,
but I can't go out like this.</font>

776
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:02,801
<font color="yellow">Then you should have told us.</font>

777
00:53:03,192 --> 00:53:04,676
<font color="yellow">Give me the needle.</font>

778
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:07,457
<font color="yellow">I'll do it for you.</font>

779
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,434
<font color="yellow">Sewing isn't easy.</font>

780
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:15,403
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

781
00:53:15,676 --> 00:53:18,604
<font color="yellow">It's like that if you haven't tried it before.</font>

782
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,191
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. It was sewed on
wrong from the beginning.</font>

783
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:39,177
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! Did I poke you? I'm sorry!</font>

784
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:44,738
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I yelled because
I was shocked, not hurt.</font>

785
00:53:45,364 --> 00:53:49,355
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Jo. I'll hurry up.</font>

786
00:54:12,504 --> 00:54:14,040
<font color="yellow">It's all done now.</font>

787
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:15,706
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

788
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:16,731
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

789
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:39,650
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, hold on!</font>

790
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:41,222
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

791
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:46,829
<font color="yellow">You forgot your cell-phone.</font>

792
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,183
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

793
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,919
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

794
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,200
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

795
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,565
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

796
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,535
<font color="yellow">Since it's on the way, I'll take you home.</font>

797
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:09,638
<font color="yellow">No. This bus will take me right home.</font>

798
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:12,254
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

799
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,863
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

800
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,403
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

801
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:09,060
<font color="yellow">I just asked you a question.
What are you doing right now?</font>

802
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,325
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?</font>

803
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:12,816
<font color="yellow">I'm making kimchi.</font>

804
00:56:13,777 --> 00:56:16,019
<font color="yellow">But why are you doing all of this by yourself?</font>

805
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,058
<font color="yellow">What about the other family members?</font>

806
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:19,769
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

807
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:23,613
<font color="yellow">mother is sick, so she's inside,
and grandmother</font>

808
00:56:23,924 --> 00:56:25,955
<font color="yellow">and the others went to the hot springs.</font>

809
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:28,144
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

810
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:32,750
<font color="yellow">All of them went to the
hot springs without you?</font>

811
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:34,995
<font color="yellow">What about Jang-go?</font>

812
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:40,370
<font color="yellow">Jang-go went to a funeral to Yeosu.</font>

813
00:56:41,355 --> 00:56:42,688
<font color="yellow">He'll come tomorrow.</font>

814
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:46,941
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

815
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:53,507
<font color="yellow">Your mother-in-law is doing this
just to give you a hard time, huh?</font>

816
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:55,199
<font color="yellow">- No!
- What do you mean no?</font>

817
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,566
<font color="yellow">No matter how much she hates you,
she shouldn't do this to you.</font>

818
00:56:59,855 --> 00:57:01,604
<font color="yellow">She should come out and help you!</font>

819
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:04,269
<font color="yellow">How can she tell you
do all of this by yourself?</font>

820
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:06,926
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

821
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:10,606
<font color="yellow">- Come out here, Ms. Hwang! Look here!
- Mom! Don't do this!</font>

822
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:15,190
<font color="yellow">Mother is sick. That's why I said
I would do it. Please ignore this, mom.</font>

823
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,230
<font color="yellow">Mom, please.</font>

824
00:57:20,597 --> 00:57:21,597
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

825
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,120
<font color="yellow">Wait a little bit.</font>

826
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,179
<font color="yellow">I'll change and come out.</font>

827
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:28,405
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. I can do this by myself.</font>

828
00:57:28,777 --> 00:57:32,402
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous! How will you
make all of this kimchi by yourself?</font>

829
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:34,769
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

830
00:58:09,238 --> 00:58:12,438
<font color="yellow">Her mother is helping her!
I can't believe this!</font>

831
00:58:13,012 --> 00:58:15,172
<font color="yellow">I need to chase her mother out first!</font>

832
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:44,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. It was sewed on
wrong from the beginning.</font>

833
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:55,222
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! Did I poke you? I'm sorry!</font>

834
00:59:25,472 --> 00:59:26,472
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

835
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:30,055
<font color="yellow">- You should sleep more.
- When did you come here?</font>

836
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:32,274
<font color="yellow">You should sleep more. Why did you come out?</font>

837
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:35,010
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you doing this? I can do it.</font>

838
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:38,808
<font color="yellow">Goodness, no. You don't need to do this.</font>

839
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:41,587
<font color="yellow">Go and sleep more.
That way, you can go to work.</font>

840
00:59:41,965 --> 00:59:45,105
<font color="yellow">You work, too. Go and sleep.</font>

841
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:46,559
<font color="yellow">I'll do the rest.</font>

842
00:59:46,754 --> 00:59:49,738
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to finish this by yourself.</font>

843
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,098
<font color="yellow">I said go inside.</font>

844
00:59:53,738 --> 00:59:56,089
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's do it together then.</font>

845
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,262
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, mom.</font>

846
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:06,333
<font color="yellow">Why would you be sorry? Don't say that.
It makes me feel sorrier.</font>

847
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:09,214
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

848
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:20,151
<font color="yellow">There are so many of them.</font>

849
01:00:32,051 --> 01:00:34,517
<font color="yellow">Hey! Where do you think you're going?</font>

850
01:00:35,722 --> 01:00:36,722
<font color="yellow">To work.</font>

851
01:00:36,747 --> 01:00:38,778
<font color="yellow">You're going to work while leaving behind that</font>

852
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,660
<font color="yellow">pile of cabbages? Are you out of your mind?</font>

853
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:42,506
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm in charge of something important</font>

854
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:44,311
<font color="yellow">at work today, so I have to hurry up and go.</font>

855
01:00:44,535 --> 01:00:47,050
<font color="yellow">Instead, I'll leave early
and finish the kimchi.</font>

856
01:00:47,075 --> 01:00:48,075
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry!</font>

857
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:50,857
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! How can you
just leave like that?</font>

858
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:19,394
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

859
01:01:20,207 --> 01:01:21,481
<font color="yellow">I almost passed it.</font>

860
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:24,519
<font color="yellow">I can't be late. What do I do?</font>

861
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:44,364
<font color="yellow">What's up with her?</font>

862
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:49,646
<font color="yellow">I thought she couldn't come to work
because she's making kimchi.</font>

863
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:53,527
<font color="yellow">Did she come to work
while she was making kimchi?</font>

864
01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:56,418
<font color="yellow">It got suddenly cold, you know, so we should</font>

865
01:01:56,443 --> 01:01:58,458
<font color="yellow">come up with a new
market plan for fur clothing.</font>

866
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:00,077
<font color="yellow">I think that's a good idea.</font>

867
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:03,966
<font color="yellow">I think pretty padding is in nowadays.
What about padding?</font>

868
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:07,203
<font color="yellow">Women do love padding.</font>

869
01:02:07,711 --> 01:02:10,727
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Mi-poong?</font>

870
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:14,832
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a good idea.</font>

871
01:02:17,844 --> 01:02:19,918
<font color="yellow">You smell like garlic and salted shrimp.</font>

872
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,721
<font color="yellow">You must not have taken
a shower before you came.</font>

873
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:25,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Do I smell that much?</font>

874
01:02:25,883 --> 01:02:29,167
<font color="yellow">I was so busy that I couldn't even shower.
All I did was wash my face.</font>

875
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:33,534
<font color="yellow">Did you make kimchi by yourself?
Why do you look so tired?</font>

876
01:02:33,873 --> 01:02:35,013
<font color="yellow">You didn't get enough sleep?</font>

877
01:02:35,038 --> 01:02:36,625
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay.</font>

878
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:40,705
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to send the new apparel
to the stores today. Will you be okay?</font>

879
01:02:43,196 --> 01:02:45,907
<font color="yellow">I don't think you can. The new apparel
we are sending today are</font>

880
01:02:45,932 --> 01:02:48,515
<font color="yellow">extremely valuable, so we need
to be extra careful with them.</font>

881
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,029
<font color="yellow">Young-ju, can you support Mi-poong today?</font>

882
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:56,139
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have to visit five stores today.</font>

883
01:02:56,432 --> 01:02:59,533
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I'm totally fine.</font>

884
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,376
<font color="yellow">All right then.</font>

885
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:08,330
<font color="yellow">But I have something important
to do at home today, so</font>

886
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:11,709
<font color="yellow">can I leave as soon as
I'm done with the warehouse?</font>

887
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:14,189
