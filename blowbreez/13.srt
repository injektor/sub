00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:26,636
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Jo Hee-dong.</font>

00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:28,727
<font color="yellow">Are you...?</font>

10
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:32,504
<font color="yellow">I would like to experience that
model work you offered me last time.</font>

11
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:34,133
<font color="yellow">Is the offer still on the table?</font>

12
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:35,158
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

13
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,516
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare tomorrow's lunch.</font>

00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,195
<font color="yellow">Don't eat before you come.</font>

15
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,617
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,984
<font color="yellow">I should be the thankful one.</font>

17
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:20,914
<font color="yellow">All I did was change a light bulb,
but I got to eat your delicious cooking.</font>

18
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:22,976
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

19
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:28,265
<font color="yellow">I was very grateful that
you ate with me today.</font>

20
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:31,555
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

21
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,940
<font color="yellow">today is my birthday.</font>

22
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,766
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Your birthday?</font>

23
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:48,856
<font color="yellow">Ever since both my parents passed away
in a car accident when I was in high school,</font>

24
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,937
<font color="yellow">I spent my birthdays alone.</font>

25
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,256
<font color="yellow">But when we were eating
seaweed soup together,</font>

26
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:05,561
<font color="yellow">I felt so strange.</font>

27
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:10,531
<font color="yellow">I felt so warm.</font>

28
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:20,331
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me? I'm so sorry.</font>

29
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:35,172
<font color="yellow">Kiss me.</font>

30
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:39,744
<font color="yellow">Why are you just looking at me? Kiss me.</font>

31
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,821
<font color="yellow">I was happy to be with you, too. Really.</font>

32
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:13,049
<font color="yellow">And I didn't just hug you now</font>

33
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,793
<font color="yellow">because of momentary feelings.</font>

34
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:19,257
<font color="yellow">So what I'm trying to say is...</font>

35
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:24,354
<font color="yellow">that ever since I first saw you...</font>

36
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,435
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

37
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,661
<font color="yellow">What a fool. Is he really a man?</font>

38
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:53,234
<font color="yellow">I set up everything for him!
All he had to do was finish it up!</font>

39
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:56,751
<font color="yellow">I liked you ever since I first saw you!</font>

40
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:58,831
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae,</font>

41
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,464
<font color="yellow">"Happy birthday-"</font>

42
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:06,737
<font color="yellow">"-to you!"</font>

43
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,962
<font color="yellow">He must have gone mad.</font>

44
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,031
<font color="yellow">So this is his house, huh?</font>

45
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,063
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll make sure
to go into this house.</font>

46
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:26,015
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that you won't
be able to accept our conditions?</font>

47
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:30,756
<font color="yellow">What my clients want are the promised
reinstatement and proper compensation.</font>

48
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:33,223
<font color="yellow">But how can you even
think of ending this whole</font>

49
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,923
<font color="yellow">thing with just a small amount of money?</font>

50
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,582
<font color="yellow">I knew you would do this.</font>

51
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,118
<font color="yellow">Aren't you the one who doesn't want to
settle this matter more than your clients?</font>

52
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,876
<font color="yellow">If you promise their reinstatement,
then we can settle with compensation.</font>

53
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,461
<font color="yellow">Then we have nothing
to say on our end either.</font>

54
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:59,399
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, you're going to regret
not doing the settlement today.</font>

55
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,815
<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait and
see about that. See you in court.</font>

56
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:42,977
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

57
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,063
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

58
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:46,962
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

59
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:48,912
<font color="yellow">What is it, mom?</font>

60
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:51,875
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking about?</font>

61
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:56,294
<font color="yellow">You could get hurt if
you space out on the streets.</font>

62
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,200
<font color="yellow">Did something happen at work?</font>

63
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,065
<font color="yellow">No, nothing happened.</font>

64
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:04,924
<font color="yellow">All right. Yoo-sung is waiting for us.
Let's hurry up and go.</font>

65
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:08,251
<font color="yellow">Let's make hot tofu stew for dinner.</font>

66
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,602
<font color="yellow">Tofu stew? Sounds good!</font>

67
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,665
<font color="yellow">With a lot of dried red pepper powder in it!</font>

68
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,338
<font color="yellow">It'll be delicious!</font>

69
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,282
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

70
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,079
<font color="yellow">You found Hee-ra?</font>

71
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,831
<font color="yellow">Where is she right now?</font>

72
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:45,555
<font color="yellow">Okay, all right.</font>

73
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:48,204
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

74
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:51,644
<font color="yellow">I think I ate too much.</font>

75
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,270
<font color="yellow">I'm so full. Jang-soo,
what if my stomach comes out?</font>

76
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:59,374
<font color="yellow">Come on. That's fine.</font>

77
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,761
<font color="yellow">Goodness. How cute will my baby
be with her stomach popping out?</font>

78
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,000
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about it is so adorable.</font>

79
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,841
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What's wrong with you, Jang-soo?</font>

80
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,120
<font color="yellow">Who looks cute with
their stomach popping out?</font>

81
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:10,383
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

82
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,259
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I don't know!</font>

83
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:18,813
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

84
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,501
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

85
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,851
<font color="yellow">There's not enough money in here.</font>

86
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,976
<font color="yellow">That can't be true.</font>

87
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:35,045
<font color="yellow">It's fine, Jang-soo. I'll pay.
I can pay with my card.</font>

88
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,686
<font color="yellow">This card has been suspended.</font>

89
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,511
<font color="yellow">My card has been suspended?</font>

90
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:45,595
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

91
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:46,885
<font color="yellow">That can't be true.</font>

92
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,989
<font color="yellow">Then I'll pay with cash.</font>

93
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,462
<font color="yellow">I have $15.</font>

94
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:53,602
<font color="yellow">I have $7.</font>

95
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,167
<font color="yellow">I have some coins, too.</font>

96
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,023
<font color="yellow">Is that the correct amount?</font>

97
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,048
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

98
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:08,807
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.</font>

99
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,610
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

100
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,955
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

101
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:20,524
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, this is
the correct place, right?</font>

102
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,266
<font color="yellow">He said it was this restaurant.</font>

103
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:27,201
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, what do we do now?
Our cards don't work</font>

104
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:30,242
<font color="yellow">and we don't have money either!
I'm so embarrassed!</font>

105
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,855
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! It's Hee-ra!</font>

106
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

107
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:39,735
<font color="yellow">- Run, Jang-soo!
- Why?</font>

108
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,056
<font color="yellow">Run away!</font>

109
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,081
<font color="yellow">Get them!</font>

110
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,149
<font color="yellow">Run!</font>

111
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:45,571
<font color="yellow">I got you!</font>

112
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,578
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

113
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,276
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra.
- Don't move! You guys are surrounded now!</font>

114
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:52,975
<font color="yellow">You guys are rats in a trap now!</font>

115
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,889
<font color="yellow">- Run!
- Hee-ra!</font>

116
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:57,560
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Rats in a trap!</font>

117
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:58,912
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, come here!</font>

118
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:00,985
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

119
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,306
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- No!</font>

120
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,740
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

121
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,653
<font color="yellow">Yes! I got him!</font>

122
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,843
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm sorry!</font>

123
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,149
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm sorry!</font>

124
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:28,382
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Hey, you brats!</font>

125
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,368
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

126
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,016
<font color="yellow">Hey! Stop!</font>

127
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,235
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

128
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:40,670
<font color="yellow">What are we doing? It's not like we're
working out in the moonlight.</font>

129
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,623
<font color="yellow">I lost Hee-ra because of you!</font>

130
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:46,257
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to scream?</font>

131
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,046
<font color="yellow">I'll get her.</font>

132
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:53,322
<font color="yellow">I'm going to shave her head bald and
trap her in the deepest part of the mountain!</font>

133
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:59,056
<font color="yellow">You don't think that I know
that you set this whole</font>

134
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,926
<font color="yellow">thing up with your son
to steal my daughter?</font>

135
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

136
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:08,506
<font color="yellow">"Cow Jang-soo. Dog Jang-soo. Thief?"</font>

137
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
<font color="yellow">The things she says!</font>

138
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:19,169
<font color="yellow">Mother, why aren't you sleeping?</font>

139
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:25,647
<font color="yellow">The more I think about this,
the angrier I get.</font>

140
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:29,324
<font color="yellow">I couldn't just lie down and sleep.</font>

141
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,619
<font color="yellow">I mean, how great are they to
be able to disrespect us like this?</font>

142
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,205
<font color="yellow">Aren't they the thieves
for trying to steal</font>

143
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,387
<font color="yellow">their father's distant
cousin's inheritance?</font>

144
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:44,042
<font color="yellow">But how dare they call us the thieves?</font>

145
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:48,266
<font color="yellow">It's all ridiculous talk,
so don't hold it in your heart.</font>

146
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:55,866
<font color="yellow">We don't need such a woman, whose parents
treat him worse than a dog, for Jang-soo.</font>

147
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:58,973
<font color="yellow">Make sure you tell them that
we don't want to be linked</font>

148
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,918
<font color="yellow">with them even if
they're millionaires or billionaires.</font>

149
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

150
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,578
<font color="yellow">Yes, I got it.</font>

151
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:10,475
<font color="yellow">Is it Jang-soo?</font>

152
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,155
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

153
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,413
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm doing well with Hee-ra.</font>

154
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,129
<font color="yellow">So don't worry.</font>

155
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,830
<font color="yellow">Tell grandma not to worry, too.</font>

156
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,109
<font color="yellow">Please be on our side, mom.</font>

157
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:29,210
<font color="yellow">Out of all the girls in the world,
why did he have to fall for that one?</font>

158
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:32,820
<font color="yellow">What do we do about Jang-soo?</font>

159
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,360
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong.</font>

160
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,974
<font color="yellow">Did you just get off work?</font>

161
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,017
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming home so late?</font>

162
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:57,698
<font color="yellow">What about you? How dare a woman
like you roam around so late at night?</font>

163
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,424
<font color="yellow">You're lecturing again.</font>

164
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:04,807
<font color="yellow">I wasn't roaming around. I came to buy
milk for Yoo-sung to drink in the morning.</font>

165
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:08,803
<font color="yellow">But were you working until now?</font>

166
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:10,593
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

167
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:12,775
<font color="yellow">I have an important trial tomorrow.</font>

168
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:15,080
<font color="yellow">Lately I've been
so busy preparing for that.</font>

169
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,718
<font color="yellow">But earlier...</font>

170
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,210
<font color="yellow">Earlier?</font>

171
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:26,444
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

172
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,555
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Why did you stop talking about it?</font>

173
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,069
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

174
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,561
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

175
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:35,015
<font color="yellow">You're making me really curious.</font>

176
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:36,554
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

177
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,326
<font color="yellow">It's not anything important.</font>

178
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,116
<font color="yellow">About your female friend from earlier...</font>

179
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:46,068
<font color="yellow">What kind of friend is she?</font>

180
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,432
<font color="yellow">My female friend?</font>

181
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,084
<font color="yellow">Oh, Ha-yeon?</font>

182
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:56,985
<font color="yellow">That's not such a hard question.
Why hesitate to ask me that?</font>

183
00:13:57,522 --> 00:13:58,657
<font color="yellow">She's my college friend.</font>

184
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:02,869
<font color="yellow">She's also the lawyer who'll be
fighting against me tomorrow.</font>

185
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:07,910
<font color="yellow">Then you're going against your friend?</font>

186
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,873
<font color="yellow">What kind of joke of a fate is that?</font>

187
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:12,655
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

188
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,944
<font color="yellow">It just happened.</font>

189
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,294
<font color="yellow">Oh! Your nose is bleeding!</font>

190
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,026
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

191
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,796
<font color="yellow">Don't. You'll ruin your shirt.</font>

192
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,747
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I can just wash it.</font>

193
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:25,678
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right.</font>

194
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:28,288
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

195
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:30,749
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

196
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,296
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm not bleeding much.</font>

197
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:37,472
<font color="yellow">How can you work so hard to prepare
for your trial that your nose bleeds?</font>

198
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,424
<font color="yellow">Is your friend that strong?</font>

199
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,608
<font color="yellow">Rather than that,
it's because I have to win this trial.</font>

200
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,959
<font color="yellow">If we lose this trial,
my clients will face a difficult time.</font>

201
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,569
<font color="yellow">They're giving up
their compensation for this.</font>

202
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:52,804
<font color="yellow">You'll do well.</font>

203
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,299
<font color="yellow">You're usually a silly fool,</font>

204
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,111
<font color="yellow">but when you work as a lawyer,
you're courageous and amazing.</font>

205
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,440
<font color="yellow">On top of that, the strong one
doesn't win. It's justice that wins.</font>

206
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:09,554
<font color="yellow">If you're on the side of justice,
you'll win for sure.</font>

207
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:15,128
<font color="yellow">I guess you do know your stuff.</font>

208
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,977
<font color="yellow">Of course! What do you take me for?</font>

209
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:24,124
<font color="yellow">You look pretty with your hair down.</font>

210
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,978
<font color="yellow">Well, my face is beautiful,
so whether I put my hair up or down,</font>

211
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:34,340
<font color="yellow">I'll look beautiful no matter what.</font>

212
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:36,638
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

213
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,630
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

214
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,403
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams!</font>

215
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:48,982
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

216
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:03,941
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

217
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,305
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

218
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,606
<font color="yellow">I was preparing for my trial tomorrow.</font>

219
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,167
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

220
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:10,777
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was about to.</font>

221
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,067
<font color="yellow">Did you eat dinner?</font>

222
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,571
<font color="yellow">Want me to fry rice cakes for you?</font>

223
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,012
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I won't be able
to digest if I eat so late.</font>

224
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,037
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

225
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:19,692
<font color="yellow">Then wash up and go to bed.</font>

226
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:20,848
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good night.</font>

227
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,482
<font color="yellow">Okay. Oh, and...</font>

228
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:27,206
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo said he won't be able to come
tonight because he has acting practice.</font>

229
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:29,146
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go to bed.</font>

230
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:31,057
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

231
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,083
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

232
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,911
<font color="yellow">What do I do about Jang-soo?</font>

233
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:41,224
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja is against him.
I can't do this or that.</font>

234
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,505
<font color="yellow">Oh, Ha-yeon? She's my college friend.</font>

235
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,841
<font color="yellow">She's also the lawyer who'll be
fighting against me tomorrow.</font>

236
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,747
<font color="yellow">I guess he met his friend
to talk about the trial.</font>

237
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:06,079
<font color="yellow">You look pretty with your hair down.</font>

238
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:12,276
<font color="yellow">Jang-go has good taste.</font>

239
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,068
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

240
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:53,661
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mi-poong.</font>

241
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:54,963
<font color="yellow">You didn't go to work yet?</font>

242
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,810
<font color="yellow">I had something to give you.</font>

243
00:17:58,255 --> 00:17:59,356
<font color="yellow">Something to give to me?</font>

244
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,381
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

245
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:02,552
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

246
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,398
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell? It's a handkerchief.</font>

247
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:08,529
<font color="yellow">Why? You think my nose will bleed again?</font>

248
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,055
<font color="yellow">It's a four-leaf clover.</font>

249
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:19,707
<font color="yellow">I thought you would need luck today,
so I spent all night stitching it up.</font>

250
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,478
<font color="yellow">Do you like it?</font>

251
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,275
<font color="yellow">It's a lucky handkerchief.</font>

252
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,617
<font color="yellow">You spent the night stitching it up?</font>

253
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:35,365
<font color="yellow">Hey. What's this?</font>

254
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:38,437
<font color="yellow">You should have done it properly.
It's all crooked.</font>

255
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,168
<font color="yellow">I spent all night making that.
If you're going to say something</font>

256
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,908
<font color="yellow">like that, just give it to me.
I'll wipe Yoo-sung's nose with it.</font>

257
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:47,894
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

258
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:49,657
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

259
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:53,794
<font color="yellow">Make sure to win
the trial today. Cheer up!</font>

260
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,533
<font color="yellow">Cheer up!</font>

261
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,361
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what are you doing?</font>

262
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:00,954
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go.</font>

263
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:01,979
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

264
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:05,697
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

265
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,213
<font color="yellow">I'll drive today.</font>

266
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:17,939
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

267
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:47,064
<font color="yellow">I thought you would need luck today,
so I spent all night stitching it up.</font>

268
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:06,855
<font color="yellow">We shall start the 2016 summation 21755:
the confirmation of the invalidity</font>

269
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,509
<font color="yellow">of the dismissal and demand of payment,
in the Seoul Central District Court.</font>

270
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:18,126
<font color="yellow">First of all, I would like to
thank you for coming out today.</font>

271
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,775
<font color="yellow">Please introduce yourself first.</font>

272
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,450
<font color="yellow">I'm the head of the personnel section
of Bang Bang Mart, Kim Doo-shik.</font>

273
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:30,501
<font color="yellow">Witness, what did you say was the
reason that plaintiffs Baek Seung-hwa</font>

274
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:34,837
<font color="yellow">and Shin Yong-cheol were unable
to become permanent employees?</font>

275
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:40,286
<font color="yellow">Well, that's because they had to leave
before the two-year contract ended.</font>

276
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,557
<font color="yellow">If they filled up the entire two years,
you'd have to make them permanent employees.</font>

277
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,671
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you intentionally
delayed their contract renewal?</font>

278
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:48,696
<font color="yellow">I object.</font>

279
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:54,159
<font color="yellow">That's the assumption of the
plaintiffs' lawyer. It's a groundless fact.</font>

280
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,184
<font color="yellow">(Judge)</font>

281
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,247
<font color="yellow">I acknowledge that.</font>

282
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:58,197
<font color="yellow">That is all.</font>

283
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,635
<font color="yellow">The defense side may
question the witness.</font>

284
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:08,792
<font color="yellow">Can you please explain
the exact details of why</font>

285
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,525
<font color="yellow">they were unable to become
permanent employees?</font>

286
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,197
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

287
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,428
<font color="yellow">As I said before,</font>

288
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:19,298
<font color="yellow">the business went bankrupt
before they were able to fulfill the</font>

289
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:24,298
<font color="yellow">two-year dispatch contracts and
was unable to renew their contracts</font>

290
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,899
<font color="yellow">So in other words, Bang Bang Mart
didn't delay the contract renewal.</font>

291
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:31,979
<font color="yellow">The company was just unable to do so
because of the bankruptcy.</font>

292
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:34,324
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

293
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,843
<font color="yellow">That means that Bang Bang Mart
has no responsibilities for their</font>

294
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:42,760
<font color="yellow">dismissals or pensions because they
were only temporary dispatch workers.</font>

295
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:46,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, we bear no responsibility.</font>

296
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,392
<font color="yellow">That is all.</font>

297
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:54,053
<font color="yellow">Your honor, I request
an additional interrogation.</font>

298
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:05,990
<font color="yellow">Witness, who was in charge
of supervising the plaintiffs'</font>

299
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:08,614
<font color="yellow">work schedule and allowing them
monthly and annual leaves?</font>

300
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,706
<font color="yellow">Was it Bang Bang Mart
or the dispatch company?</font>

301
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:13,692
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

302
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,183
<font color="yellow">we were.</font>

303
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:17,957
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

304
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:23,627
<font color="yellow">At Bang Bang Mart, if the employees
are tardy or late, it makes them</font>

305
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:27,066
<font color="yellow">write statements of reasons, gave them
a penalty, and docked their pay.</font>

306
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:30,832
<font color="yellow">This shows that the ones
who personally managed the</font>

307
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:34,558
<font color="yellow">plaintiffs was Bang Bang Mart
and not the dispatch company.</font>

308
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:39,140
<font color="yellow">I submit the employees' schedule
of work as evidence.</font>

309
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:54,515
<font color="yellow">Is Jang-go doing well?</font>

310
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:59,646
<font color="yellow">Last of all, there is
no dispatch business allowed</font>

311
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,274
<font color="yellow">in big markets.
Did you know that, witness?</font>

312
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

313
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:09,192
<font color="yellow">If you look at the dispatch laws, it states
that food salesmen, cigarette salesmen,</font>

314
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:12,246
<font color="yellow">clothing, shoes,
and accessories salesmen,</font>

315
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,962
<font color="yellow">furniture salesmen, electronic device
salesmen, and books and stationary</font>

316
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:18,498
<font color="yellow">salesmen are not
allowed to be dispatched.</font>

317
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:23,879
<font color="yellow">Witness, what kind of work
did Baek Seung-hwa do?</font>

318
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:29,494
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

319
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:33,209
<font color="yellow">don't know.</font>

320
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:37,667
<font color="yellow">Baek Seung-hwa sold furniture
at Bang Bang Mart, and</font>

321
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,707
<font color="yellow">Shin Yong-cheol sold electronic devices.</font>

322
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:45,121
<font color="yellow">Therefore, their departments
are not valid to have dispatch</font>

323
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:49,054
<font color="yellow">workers, so they can be seen
as illegal dispatch workers.</font>

324
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:57,902
<font color="yellow">The plaintiffs must, of course be re-hired as
permanent workers at the Bang Bang Mart,</font>

325
00:23:57,927 --> 00:24:03,550
<font color="yellow">be paid for six months of unemployment, and be
separately compensated $30,000 per person.</font>

326
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:14,449
<font color="yellow">That is all.</font>

327
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:30,098
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

328
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,832
<font color="yellow">Congratulations for winning.</font>

329
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You did well, too.</font>

330
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,998
<font color="yellow">See you around.</font>

331
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

332
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:47,629
<font color="yellow">I heard she's the daughter
of the head of Jang & Ko.</font>

333
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,683
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

334
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:52,507
<font color="yellow">Her expression doesn't change.
Is she spiteful or cool?</font>

335
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:56,939
<font color="yellow">She's a lawyer,
but she's fashionable and pretty.</font>

336
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:58,739
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

337
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:02,707
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee Jang-go, please tell us how
you feel about winning today's trial.</font>

338
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:05,957
<font color="yellow">Weren't you burdened that you were
going against Jang & Ko Law Firm?</font>

339
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:08,590
<font color="yellow">People are comparing
this to David and Goliath.</font>

340
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:11,469
<font color="yellow">- Do you think...
- Reporters, please don't do this.</font>

341
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:13,695
<font color="yellow">Please ask one question at a time.</font>

342
00:25:13,856 --> 00:25:15,604
<font color="yellow">Tell us how you feel about winning.</font>

343
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:26,695
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, Jang-go won
that tremendous law firm Jang & Ko.</font>

344
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:28,418
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

345
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,410
<font color="yellow">Jang-go totally became a star!</font>

346
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:31,746
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

347
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:34,395
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

348
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:39,457
<font color="yellow">So all these people here are reporters?</font>

349
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,770
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

350
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:45,638
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!
Jang-go is like some sort of celebrity</font>

351
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:47,901
<font color="yellow">He hit jackpot!</font>

352
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,551
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! Jang-go's
article is already up!</font>

353
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,572
<font color="yellow">"David and Goliath."</font>

354
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:58,497
<font color="yellow">"Lawyer Lee Jang-go
who won against Jang & Ko."</font>

355
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,605
<font color="yellow">Look at this, Geum-sil!</font>

356
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,465
<font color="yellow">- Goodness!
- Oh, my!</font>

357
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:04,067
<font color="yellow">This is my son, Jang-go!</font>

358
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,897
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this, Nam-yi!</font>

359
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:11,681
<font color="yellow">Now that this article is up,
we'll get a lot of clients!</font>

360
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:16,348
<font color="yellow">It would be so great if that happened!</font>

361
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:21,067
<font color="yellow">You should have told me
he was doing such a huge trial.</font>

362
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:24,369
<font color="yellow">He just talked to me last night
like it was no big deal,</font>

363
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:27,228
<font color="yellow">so I thought it was
one of those pathetic trials again.</font>

364
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,867
<font color="yellow">This was such an
important trial that I didn't</font>

365
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:31,817
<font color="yellow">want to burden him,
so I was being careful.</font>

366
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:37,590
<font color="yellow">And it was so chaotic
because of Jang-soo lately.</font>

367
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:39,917
<font color="yellow">Let me see my son's article again.</font>

368
00:26:39,942 --> 00:26:40,942
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

369
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:43,832
<font color="yellow">- Oh my goodness!
- Mom.</font>

370
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:47,981
<font color="yellow">Oh, my Jang-go! He's so handsome!
Who gave birth to him?</font>

371
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:49,574
<font color="yellow">- Mother.
- Yes?</font>

372
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,478
<font color="yellow">I gave birth to him!</font>

373
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,383
<font color="yellow">Grandma! Mom! Aunt!</font>

374
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:57,894
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

375
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,596
<font color="yellow">- Jang-soo!
- Lee Jang-soo!</font>

376
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:05,467
<font color="yellow">Oh, that young lady is...</font>

377
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:07,027
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

378
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,168
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

379
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:13,996
<font color="yellow">Grandma, mom, and aunt.
Give us some food. We're starving.</font>

380
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:34,207
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

381
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:48,017
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!
What are they doing while eating?</font>

382
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,046
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

383
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,739
<font color="yellow">It's delicious!</font>

384
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:55,488
<font color="yellow">- It's good.
- Do they really want to do that?</font>

385
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:56,513
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo.</font>

386
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,909
<font color="yellow">But they're so cute.</font>

387
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:12,865
<font color="yellow">Hey. When they're done eating,
tell her to go home.</font>

388
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,597
<font color="yellow">And make sure to let her know
we're against this relationship, too.</font>

389
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:18,277
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

390
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,199
<font color="yellow">You want to separate them
when they love each other so much?</font>

391
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:26,925
<font color="yellow">Hey, didn't you hear her mother call him
cow Jang-soo, dog Jang-soo, and a thief?</font>

392
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:31,430
<font color="yellow">I don't want that kind of family
to be linked to ours anyways!</font>

393
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,181
<font color="yellow">Mom, she's a phoenix.
Yet, you want to chase her away?</font>

394
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:39,097
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? You're supposed to
catch her even if she says she'll leave.</font>

395
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:42,080
<font color="yellow">Nowadays, daughters have rights, too.</font>

396
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:45,170
<font color="yellow">She's a phoenix worth
at least 50 million dollars!</font>

397
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,038
<font color="yellow">Calculate before
you say something like that.</font>

398
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,900
<font color="yellow">Anyways, call her mom and
let her know her daughter is here.</font>

399
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:02,043
<font color="yellow">Imagine how she would feel
as the parent of a daughter.</font>

400
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,774
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated!</font>

401
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:08,371
<font color="yellow">We told him to study
to become a civil servant!</font>

402
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:11,204
<font color="yellow">There's nothing
about him we can brag about!</font>

403
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,946
<font color="yellow">They have every right to be upset.</font>

404
00:29:13,972 --> 00:29:15,660
<font color="yellow">Think about it in their shoes.</font>

405
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:22,562
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, open up!</font>

406
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:26,510
<font color="yellow">- Is it good?
- Oh my gosh.</font>

407
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,934
<font color="yellow">They have honey
dripping out of their eyes.</font>

408
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:29,959
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

409
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:32,594
<font color="yellow">- They're so cute!
- It's so good!</font>

410
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:39,537
<font color="yellow">I'm so dizzy.</font>

411
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:49,370
<font color="yellow">This little brat.</font>

412
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,504
<font color="yellow">(Geum-sil)</font>

413
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:06,058
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

414
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,863
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

415
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,574
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra came to your house?</font>

416
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:16,495
<font color="yellow">Yeah, she just came with Jang-soo.</font>

417
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,517
<font color="yellow">I thought you had to know.</font>

418
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,862
<font color="yellow">All right! Don't let her go anywhere!</font>

419
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,082
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

420
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:28,995
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

421
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:41,415
<font color="yellow">So you two are saying
that you will never be able to</font>

422
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,980
<font color="yellow">separate from each other no matter what?</font>

423
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

424
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:51,139
<font color="yellow">Even if we die, we can never break up.</font>

425
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:53,542
<font color="yellow">I feel the same way.</font>

426
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:56,753
<font color="yellow">I can't live without Jang-soo now.</font>

427
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:01,863
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra!</font>

428
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:04,742
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Hee-ra!</font>

429
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:08,280
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra!
- Mom!</font>

430
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:11,113
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Nothing happened, right?</font>

431
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:12,807
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

432
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,792
<font color="yellow">Then that's fine. Let's go.</font>

433
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,230
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

434
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:20,074
<font color="yellow">I can't go. I won't go.</font>

435
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,329
<font color="yellow">What about Jang-soo?</font>

436
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:26,284
<font color="yellow">Let's go! This is not somewhere
you should be! Let's go!</font>

437
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,636
<font color="yellow">I'll go if you allow us to be together.</font>

438
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:31,987
<font color="yellow">Please give us permission.</font>

439
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,652
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Jang-soo.</font>

440
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:39,033
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

441
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:41,269
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

442
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,848
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- Hee-ra.</font>

443
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:46,855
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to your mom?</font>

444
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:50,286
<font color="yellow">How can you say that after
you see what this house looks</font>

445
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:52,826
<font color="yellow">like? It doesn't matter
if you're blinded by love!</font>

446
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:55,388
<font color="yellow">- Let's go!
- I don't want to!</font>

447
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,337
<font color="yellow">I said I don't want to go!</font>

448
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:01,492
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, what's wrong with you?</font>

449
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,842
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go with your mom!</font>

450
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:07,615
<font color="yellow">- You...
- Your mother hasn't eaten or slept</font>

451
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,895
<font color="yellow">because of you!
She's on the verge of dying!</font>

452
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:14,541
<font color="yellow">That's why you should
just give us permission!</font>

453
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,840
<font color="yellow">I love Jang-soo!</font>

454
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,840
<font color="yellow">You won't come home with me?</font>

455
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:27,057
<font color="yellow">Mom, please!</font>

456
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:36,334
<font color="yellow">Then is it him or me? Choose one of us.</font>

457
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,048
<font color="yellow">Is it me or him?</font>

458
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:41,423
<font color="yellow">Can't you just understand us?</font>

459
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:47,840
<font color="yellow">How can you tell me to
throw away the man I love?</font>

460
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:53,202
<font color="yellow">So you're going to choose him
and betray your mom?</font>

461
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:56,756
<font color="yellow">Goodness!
Get a hold of yourself, Hee-ra!</font>

462
00:32:57,512 --> 00:32:58,512
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra.</font>

463
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,485
<font color="yellow">I will ask you one last time.</font>

464
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:06,746
<font color="yellow">If you don't come with me now,
that's the end of us.</font>

465
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:09,090
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

466
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,386
<font color="yellow">Will you still stay here?</font>

467
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:17,825
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

468
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:24,047
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stay next to Jang-soo.</font>

469
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:30,166
<font color="yellow">I promised I would
stay with him forever.</font>

470
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:42,567
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

471
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:45,240
<font color="yellow">Fine. I understand.</font>

472
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:52,137
<font color="yellow">Starting from today,
you're not my daughter.</font>

473
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:54,864
<font color="yellow">We're over.</font>

474
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:58,614
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

475
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:01,049
<font color="yellow">You terrible brat!</font>

476
00:34:01,223 --> 00:34:06,074
<font color="yellow">How can you betray your mom
who raised you all this time?</font>

477
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:09,482
<font color="yellow">You and I are over, too!</font>

478
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,582
<font color="yellow">You horrible brat! Chung-ja!</font>

479
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:13,500
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Chung-ja!</font>

480
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:16,707
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

481
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:29,926
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja.</font>

482
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:34,105
<font color="yellow">You can't just leave like this.</font>

483
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:39,035
<font color="yellow">You need to lie that you'll allow them to
be together and take her away from here!</font>

484
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,043
<font color="yellow">Are you really just
going to leave like this?</font>

485
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:45,590
<font color="yellow">How can you still say that
after you witnessed everything?</font>

486
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:49,343
<font color="yellow">That brat isn't my daughter anymore.</font>

487
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:53,715
<font color="yellow">She's not my child!
She's not anything to me!</font>

488
00:34:57,403 --> 00:35:01,551
<font color="yellow">Her mom is very upset, but how could
she not even come out to see her off?</font>

489
00:35:01,576 --> 00:35:02,576
<font color="yellow">Terrible brat.</font>

490
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,441
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Chung-ja!</font>

491
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,646
<font color="yellow">Good work today. See you tomorrow.</font>

492
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,575
<font color="yellow">- Good work!
- Good work!</font>

493
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,300
<font color="yellow">- Good work!
- Good work!</font>

494
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,269
<font color="yellow">- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.</font>

495
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,137
<font color="yellow">Did Jang-soo's trial end?</font>

496
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:30,614
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

497
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,577
<font color="yellow">He probably won.</font>

498
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,391
<font color="yellow">No. He might not have won.</font>

499
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:39,833
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

500
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:45,672
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong!</font>

501
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,257
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what are you doing here?</font>

502
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:52,001
<font color="yellow">Of course I came to see you.</font>

503
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,568
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

504
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,027
<font color="yellow">about today's trial...</font>

505
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:58,565
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

506
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
<font color="yellow">The trial?</font>

507
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:04,123
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

508
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,146
<font color="yellow">I won.</font>

509
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,021
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

510
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:11,162
<font color="yellow">You could have just told me you won
right away! You scared me!</font>

511
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:14,297
<font color="yellow">You live to tease me, don't you?</font>

512
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
<font color="yellow">How'd you know?</font>

513
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:19,980
<font color="yellow">By the way, the handkerchief
you gave me actually worked.</font>

514
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:24,697
<font color="yellow">It made me feel like I took a pill of
bravery when I was nervous.</font>

515
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:26,498
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

516
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:31,185
<font color="yellow">So you're saying you won
today's trial because of me.</font>

517
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,654
<font color="yellow">Well, I guess you can say that.</font>

518
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,436
<font color="yellow">Then you should buy dinner tonight.</font>

519
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:40,864
<font color="yellow">That's why I came. To buy you dinner.</font>

520
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:44,982
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

521
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:55,287
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

522
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:10,423
<font color="yellow">What do you think of this place?</font>

523
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:12,500
<font color="yellow">Does it suit your taste?</font>

524
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:14,623
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

525
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:20,821
<font color="yellow">But it's such an expensive and
fancy place that I feel burdened.</font>

526
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,828
<font color="yellow">Don't feel burdened.</font>

527
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:28,826
<font color="yellow">From now on, I only want
to do good things for you.</font>

528
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,101
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo...</font>

529
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:37,984
<font color="yellow">By the way, can you just
call me by my first name?</font>

530
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

531
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:43,928
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

532
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:45,812
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

533
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:48,773
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

534
00:37:50,382 --> 00:37:51,382
<font color="yellow">Like that.</font>

535
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:55,327
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

536
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:07,421
<font color="yellow">Did you eat well?</font>

537
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:10,886
<font color="yellow">I did, but I think I ate too much.</font>

538
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:12,858
<font color="yellow">I think my stomach is going to explode.</font>

539
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,405
<font color="yellow">What if my stomach explodes and I die?</font>

540
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:18,658
<font color="yellow">You're fine. I never saw
anyone die because of that before.</font>

541
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:26,178
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, should we go over there
and digest our food?</font>

542
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,387
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a place for little kids?</font>

543
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:30,984
<font color="yellow">You are a little kid.</font>

544
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:32,997
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

545
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:40,302
<font color="yellow">Try hitting it.</font>

546
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:44,481
<font color="yellow">- You can hit with two hands, and I'll hit with one.
- Hit with this hand.</font>

547
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:45,506
<font color="yellow">This one?</font>

548
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,349
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

549
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,661
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

550
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,535
<font color="yellow">You're no match for me.</font>

551
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,742
<font color="yellow">Did you just play games your whole life?</font>

552
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:52,451
<font color="yellow">You can't win me.</font>

553
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,034
<font color="yellow">That. Let's play that.</font>

554
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,661
<font color="yellow">That one?</font>

555
00:39:58,794 --> 00:40:00,667
<font color="yellow">The loser has to buy coffee, okay?</font>

556
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,059
<font color="yellow">You can't change your mind.</font>

557
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:04,362
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

558
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:08,151
<font color="yellow">You can't win that! I told you
I got special lessons!</font>

559
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,530
<font color="yellow">I won, right? You surrender, right?</font>

560
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,458
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you won.</font>

561
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:50,868
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

562
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:57,879
<font color="yellow">Let's go over there.</font>

563
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:04,801
<font color="yellow">It's suddenly raining.</font>

564
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,380
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

565
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:09,549
<font color="yellow">I'm almost home now.</font>

566
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,276
<font color="yellow">You can go now.</font>

567
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,002
<font color="yellow">I'll go after I see you go.</font>

568
00:41:13,393 --> 00:41:15,757
<font color="yellow">I'll feel safe after watching you leave.</font>

569
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:17,702
<font color="yellow">Then hold on.</font>

570
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:29,398
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

571
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:34,945
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

572
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:03,917
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

573
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:09,648
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

574
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:17,506
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?</font>

575
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:21,132
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

576
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,278
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

577
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:54,855
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, can't you
stay until I fall asleep?</font>

578
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:57,132
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared.</font>

579
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:02,649
<font color="yellow">I'll stay by your side,
so don't worry and sleep.</font>

580
00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:48,843
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

581
00:43:49,445 --> 00:43:50,445
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

582
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:52,323
<font color="yellow">Did you have a nightmare?</font>

583
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,140
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

584
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:57,749
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

585
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:02,243
<font color="yellow">I miss my parents.</font>

586
00:44:04,304 --> 00:44:05,786
<font color="yellow">My parents...</font>

587
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,305
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Shin-ae.</font>

588
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,508
<font color="yellow">I'll stay by your side from now on,</font>

589
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:19,460
<font color="yellow">so don't be afraid. It's okay.</font>

590
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:26,398
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

591
00:45:11,406 --> 00:45:13,819
<font color="yellow">It's me. Good job today.</font>

592
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:18,144
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shin-ae. Call me anytime
you need that kind of help again.</font>

593
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:20,610
<font color="yellow">My brother did well, right?</font>

594
00:45:21,366 --> 00:45:22,366
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

595
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:24,528
<font color="yellow">I paid him well for that.</font>

596
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,013
<font color="yellow">It's really nice.</font>

597
00:45:49,177 --> 00:45:52,577
<font color="yellow">The breeze feels nice,
and dinner was delicious.</font>

598
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:56,783
<font color="yellow">We played games like little kids, too.
We're drinking coffee, too.</font>

599
00:45:58,115 --> 00:45:59,575
<font color="yellow">I feel great!</font>

600
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:03,458
<font color="yellow">The food was delicious,
and the coffee is good, too.</font>

601
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:09,106
<font color="yellow">This perfect day happened
because you won the trial, right?</font>

602
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,021
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

603
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:15,251
<font color="yellow">Thanks to who?</font>

604
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:22,259
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you! Thanks to you!</font>

605
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,442
<font color="yellow">Thanks to the lucky handkerchief
you made me!</font>

606
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:25,802
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

607
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,252
<font color="yellow">Bingo! You got it!</font>

608
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,785
<font color="yellow">Sometimes you take a lot of the credit.</font>

609
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:33,570
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. You're the one
who takes a lot of the credit.</font>

610
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:39,063
<font color="yellow">Did you already forget how much credit
you took because I won the logo competition?</font>

611
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:41,716
<font color="yellow">Did I do that?</font>

612
00:46:44,112 --> 00:46:47,143
<font color="yellow">Fine. You can take the credit, too.</font>

613
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

614
00:46:56,269 --> 00:47:00,815
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm very happy just
being with you like this.</i></font>

615
00:47:02,597 --> 00:47:04,510
<font color="yellow"><i>It's okay if you don't look at me.</i></font>

616
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:12,331
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm just very happy that
I can look at you like this.</i></font>

617
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:44,848
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja. Chung-ja.</font>

618
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:49,718
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja! Hurry up and get up!</font>

619
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:52,401
<font color="yellow">Mom, just leave me alone. Goodness.</font>

620
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:55,353
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, my head felt like
it was going to break, and</font>

621
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:57,621
<font color="yellow">today, my eyes feel like
they're going to pop out.</font>

622
00:48:57,646 --> 00:49:01,627
<font color="yellow">- I feel like I'm going to die.
- Dal-ho came back!</font>

623
00:49:02,378 --> 00:49:03,608
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho came back?</font>

624
00:49:03,962 --> 00:49:06,682
<font color="yellow">He's supposed to be back tomorrow!
Why did he come back already?</font>

625
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:09,574
<font color="yellow">What if he asks me where Hee-ra went?</font>

626
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,470
<font color="yellow">Tell him she went on a trip
to Hong Kong with her friends.</font>

627
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:14,159
<font color="yellow">Hong Kong?</font>

628
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,570
<font color="yellow">What about your dad?</font>

629
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:25,060
<font color="yellow">Father went into grandfather's room.</font>

630
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:26,995
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

631
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,171
<font color="yellow">This is his bag.</font>

632
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:36,302
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What's so important that
he went to see Elder right away?</font>

633
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:37,878
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

634
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:42,996
<font color="yellow">Why did it take so long?</font>

635
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:45,979
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even
tell me over the phone.</font>

636
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:48,980
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to tell me in person?</font>

637
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,057
<font color="yellow">Do you have bad news?</font>

638
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:59,120
<font color="yellow">Elder, I talked with
Jo Kyung-sook on the phone.</font>

639
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,499
<font color="yellow">What? What did you say?</font>

640
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:03,995
<font color="yellow">Jo Kyung-sook?</font>

641
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:07,614
<font color="yellow">Kyung-sook was alive?</font>

642
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:08,917
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

643
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,284
<font color="yellow">The Chinese broker in North Korea
helped me connect</font>

644
00:50:12,674 --> 00:50:14,753
<font color="yellow">with her, and she remembered
everything about you.</font>

645
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:19,050
<font color="yellow">So... so did you ask her?</font>

646
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:25,298
<font color="yellow">Did she really see my wife then?</font>

647
00:50:25,948 --> 00:50:27,802
<font color="yellow">Yes, she did.</font>

648
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,961
<font color="yellow">She said she remembers it very well.</font>

649
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:32,191
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

650
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:37,774
<font color="yellow">Then Soon-ok...</font>

651
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:43,673
<font color="yellow">was really alive?</font>

652
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:49,617
<font color="yellow">She really saw your pregnant wife
after the Third Battle of Seoul.</font>

653
00:50:50,118 --> 00:50:54,745
<font color="yellow">She even remembered that
your wife's dress was a wooden color.</font>

654
00:50:58,377 --> 00:50:59,790
<font color="yellow">She was alive.</font>

655
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:02,691
<font color="yellow">She was alive.</font>

656
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:05,673
<font color="yellow">Elder, are you okay?</font>

657
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,470
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

658
00:51:08,213 --> 00:51:10,451
<font color="yellow">How could this happen?</font>

659
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,080
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

660
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:15,682
<font color="yellow">That means Soon-ok...</font>

661
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,166
<font color="yellow">and my child...</font>

662
00:51:20,088 --> 00:51:22,568
<font color="yellow">might both be alive?</font>

663
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:25,264
<font color="yellow">Yes, Elder.</font>

664
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,470
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

665
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,108
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

666
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:40,446
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know my child was alive.</font>

667
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:43,889
<font color="yellow">Elder. Elder!</font>

668
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,371
<font color="yellow">Elder, have some water.</font>

669
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:06,174
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho,</font>

670
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:10,707
<font color="yellow">they'll be alive, won't they?</font>

671
00:52:12,728 --> 00:52:13,728
<font color="yellow">Elder...</font>

672
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:15,314
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

673
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:19,649
<font color="yellow">How can something
so unbelievable happen?</font>

674
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,949
<font color="yellow">Even after I heard that they're alive,</font>

675
00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:28,839
<font color="yellow">I can't even find them.</font>

676
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,428
<font color="yellow">I can't meet them.</font>

677
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:39,201
<font color="yellow">How can this happen?</font>

678
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:45,117
<font color="yellow">You must take care of yourself.</font>

679
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,309
<font color="yellow">If you have your health,
you can fulfill all of your wishes.</font>

680
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:51,478
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

681
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,220
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

682
00:52:57,658 --> 00:52:58,829
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

683
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:14,797
<font color="yellow">That old man keeps murmuring,
so I don't know what he's saying.</font>

684
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:16,478
<font color="yellow">Did you hear what they were saying?</font>

685
00:53:16,674 --> 00:53:18,572
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

686
00:53:19,478 --> 00:53:22,790
<font color="yellow">I think I heard something
about father fulfilling his wish.</font>

687
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,496
<font color="yellow">Wish? What wish?</font>

688
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:26,331
<font color="yellow">What's his wish?</font>

689
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:27,556
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

690
00:53:28,189 --> 00:53:30,334
<font color="yellow">I think the only wish he has is a union.</font>

691
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:31,931
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

692
00:53:33,903 --> 00:53:36,710
<font color="yellow">I don't know. What's the use
of knowing what his wish is?</font>

693
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:40,605
<font color="yellow">We'll be in big trouble if
he finds out Hee-ra is gone.</font>

694
00:53:43,005 --> 00:53:44,138
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim Mi-poong.</font>

695
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:45,163
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

696
00:53:48,794 --> 00:53:50,637
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, go to the store.</font>

697
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,888
<font color="yellow">Say hello to the manager, examine
the sales, and comprehend the inventory.</font>

698
00:53:54,913 --> 00:53:56,562
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

699
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,903
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
- Hello.</font>

700
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:04,317
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry!</font>

701
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:06,852
<font color="yellow">No, I was the one who dropped them.</font>

702
00:54:09,598 --> 00:54:10,598
<font color="yellow">Are you...?</font>

703
00:54:12,505 --> 00:54:13,505
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

704
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:17,906
<font color="yellow">You're Jang-go's friend's
younger sister, right?</font>

705
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:20,025
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

706
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,039
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

707
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:27,747
<font color="yellow">Oh, I work in the
marketing department here.</font>

708
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:29,193
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

709
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:31,701
<font color="yellow">I work here at the Jang & Ko Law Firm.</font>

710
00:54:32,286 --> 00:54:33,286
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

711
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,770
<font color="yellow">- It's good to see you again.
- Yes.</font>

712
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,898
<font color="yellow">Let's have tea next time.</font>

713
00:54:36,923 --> 00:54:38,464
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

714
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,473
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok, I'm sorry.</font>

715
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:18,973
<font color="yellow">I made you give birth to our child alone,
and I made you raise him alone as well.</font>

716
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,860
<font color="yellow">It must have been so difficult for you.</font>

717
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,982
<font color="yellow">Do I have a son or a daughter?</font>

718
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:32,530
<font color="yellow">I might have grandchildren, too.</font>

719
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:38,637
<font color="yellow">Whether I have a son or daughter...</font>

720
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:42,869
<font color="yellow">Whether I have a grandson
or a granddaughter...</font>

721
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:48,619
<font color="yellow">I want to see them at least once.</font>

722
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:55,905
<font color="yellow">Just for one day,
I wish I can live with them.</font>

723
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:59,630
<font color="yellow">Are you listening to me?</font>

724
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:02,489
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

725
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:10,111
<font color="yellow">Just please be alive.</font>

726
00:56:12,312 --> 00:56:14,248
<font color="yellow">Just please be healthy.</font>

727
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:21,671
<font color="yellow">I will make sure to find you.</font>

728
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:24,109
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

729
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,469
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

730
00:56:56,617 --> 00:57:00,140
<font color="yellow">- You may go.
- Yes, sir.</font>

731
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:03,421
<font color="yellow">After I'm done, I'll go home
on my own, so go.</font>

732
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:04,742
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

733
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:22,979
<font color="yellow">Sir, are you all right?</font>

734
00:57:23,354 --> 00:57:25,167
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm fine.</font>

735
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:26,989
<font color="yellow">Go. Go.</font>

736
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,406
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

737
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:41,202
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

738
00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:53,805
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

739
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:56,922
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

740
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:58,922
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

741
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,185
<font color="yellow">Drink some water.</font>

742
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:16,242
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better now?</font>

743
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:20,588
<font color="yellow">I was going to buy medicine,
but I thought you shouldn't</font>

744
00:58:20,613 --> 00:58:22,816
<font color="yellow">take just any medicine,
so I just bought water.</font>

745
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,908
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling better now.</font>

746
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,591
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

747
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:31,409
<font color="yellow">I think you should go to the hospital.</font>

748
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:33,023
<font color="yellow">Would you like me to take you?</font>

749
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:36,641
<font color="yellow">I don't need to go to the hospital.</font>

750
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,956
<font color="yellow">Miss, you must be busy. You can go now.</font>

751
00:58:42,246 --> 00:58:44,753
<font color="yellow">Then where do you live?
I'll catch you a taxi.</font>

752
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:50,882
<font color="yellow">I'm really fine now.
Someone is coming for me.</font>

753
00:58:54,738 --> 00:58:55,978
<font color="yellow">Then take care.</font>

754
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:57,003
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

755
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,773
<font color="yellow">Thank you, miss.</font>
