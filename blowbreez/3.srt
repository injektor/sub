2
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,562
<font color="yellow">Hello, sir! I brought the samples!</font>

3
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:30,218
<font color="yellow">You're always just on time.</font>

4
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,829
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, you're the best!</font>

5
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,848
<font color="yellow">You should check the samples.</font>

6
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,235
<font color="yellow">You never made a mistake before.</font>

7
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,226
<font color="yellow">It's obviously just right.</font>

8
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,604
<font color="yellow">You should still check.</font>

9
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,692
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, out of the clothes here, which one of them do you think will sell the best?</font>

10
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,792
<font color="yellow">You have good sense! Pick it again this time.</font>

11
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:50,523
<font color="yellow">That one.</font>

12
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:53,078
<font color="yellow">The length is just right, and the quality of the</font>

13
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,439
<font color="yellow">material is good, so it would be flexible to wear.</font>

14
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:56,758
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,546
<font color="yellow">Then I should hang up this dress in the front.</font>

16
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,622
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you move yet?</font>

17
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,835
<font color="yellow">I'm moving tomorrow.</font>

18
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,046
<font color="yellow">I'll finally be able to leave the semi-basement!</font>

19
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,071
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

20
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,909
<font color="yellow">You worked so hard to make money. You've succeed!</font>

21
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:15,223
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

22
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you! Have a good day!</font>

23
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:18,211
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

24
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:22,873
<font color="yellow">I ate so well. I think I overate. I'm so full.</font>

25
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:25,405
<font color="yellow">I'm glad the food was to your liking.</font>

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,955
<font color="yellow">The food was delicious, but why did you make</font>

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,177
<font color="yellow">so much? It must have been tiring for you.</font>

28
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:33,389
<font color="yellow">We could just have simply ate some noodles.</font>

29
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:35,590
<font color="yellow">It wasn't tiring at all.</font>

30
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,983
<font color="yellow">The maid did everything.</font>

31
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,024
<font color="yellow">If I was struck by money like you were, I wouldn't do the household chores either.</font>

32
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:46,577
<font color="yellow">But is the Elder not home?</font>

33
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,289
<font color="yellow">He went out to attend a meeting today.</font>

34
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:52,752
<font color="yellow">Maid!</font>

35
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:55,400
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to prepare the fruits and tea?</font>

36
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,915
<font color="yellow">-Hold on a minute. -Sure.</font>

37
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:00,683
<font color="yellow">Money really is good!</font>

38
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:02,921
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja looks so nice!</font>

39
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:07,399
<font color="yellow">But isn't the Elder's family in North Korea?</font>

40
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:11,110
<font color="yellow">I heard you can give your inheritance to your family in North Korea nowadays.</font>

41
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:14,824
<font color="yellow">He has no family in North Korea. They're all dead.</font>

42
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,300
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

43
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,352
<font color="yellow">-Honey, I'm home- -Honey, you're home!</font>

44
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,378
<font color="yellow">These are my friends. Say hello.</font>

45
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,095
<font color="yellow">This is my husband Jo Dal-ho.</font>

46
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:30,478
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello.</font>

47
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,639
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,016
<font color="yellow">Enjoy yourselves comfortably.</font>

49
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,072
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

50
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:42,753
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and talk amongst yourselves. I'll be back!</font>

51
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,652
<font color="yellow">Is he really Chung-ja's husband?</font>

52
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:52,189
<font color="yellow">Doesn't he look ten years younger than her?</font>

53
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:55,089
<font color="yellow">Not ten years. He's only two years younger than her.</font>

54
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,854
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja must have saved a country in her past life.</font>

55
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,853
<font color="yellow">When she was little, she was shabby and had a difficult life.</font>

56
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,290
<font color="yellow">Now she has a young, handsome husband and a 100 million dollar inheritance.</font>

57
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:07,017
<font color="yellow">She must have saved the country ten times in her past life.</font>

58
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:15,155
<font color="yellow">Your friends are here, so why did you ask me to come home early?</font>

59
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:18,857
<font color="yellow">Just...You can meet my friends.</font>

60
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,354
<font color="yellow">What's the point of me meeting your friends?</font>

61
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,678
<font color="yellow">It's not like we're going to play patty cake.</font>

62
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,048
<font color="yellow">I wanted to show off my handsome husband.</font>

63
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,923
<font color="yellow">It's too wasteful for me to see you alone.</font>

64
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,549
<font color="yellow">Come on. Don't say that anywhere else.</font>

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,559
<font color="yellow">I'm not a young man anymore.</font>

66
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,616
<font color="yellow">To other people, I'm just an old man.</font>

67
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,871
<font color="yellow">How can you be just an old man?</font>

68
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:50,009
<font color="yellow">You're still a handsome and firm young man!</font>

69
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,904
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

70
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,598
<font color="yellow">You're like a little kid.</font>

71
00:04:58,658 --> 00:04:59,658
<font color="yellow">We ate a lot.</font>

72
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:05,903
<font color="yellow">Why are you already leaving? You don't have to mind my husband.</font>

73
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:09,199
<font color="yellow">Since we know where you live, we can visit again next time.</font>

74
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,430
<font color="yellow">You're right. Visit often.</font>

75
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:16,047
<font color="yellow">But your husband isn't acting like a bachelor outside, is he?</font>

76
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,761
<font color="yellow">You should keep an eye on him.</font>

77
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:24,450
<font color="yellow">If he does, I'll kill him. I'll kill him slowly and painfully.</font>

78
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:27,711
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! He would be too scared to cheat on you!</font>

79
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,295
<font color="yellow">-We're leaving. Don't come out. -Bye!</font>

80
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,524
<font color="yellow">I'll take you guys home.</font>

81
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,095
<font color="yellow">-Oh, really? Okay! -No, go ahead.</font>

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,336
<font color="yellow">I have somewhere to go.</font>

83
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,491
<font color="yellow">-Okay then. Bye, Geum-sil. -See you again!</font>

84
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,433
<font color="yellow">-Come out to our gatherings! -Bye!</font>

85
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,711
<font color="yellow">Hello, Nam-yi.</font>

86
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:17,301
<font color="yellow">Jang-go bought a lot of meat to celebrate his</font>

87
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,482
<font color="yellow">winning today. So hurry up and come home.</font>

88
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,159
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm on my way home right now.</font>

89
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,047
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

90
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:31,941
<font color="yellow">I have Jang-go and Jang-soo, so why should I feel pathetic or be envious?</font>

91
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:35,914
<font color="yellow">Mister!</font>

92
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:48,855
<font color="yellow">-Cheers! -Cheers!</font>

93
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,547
<font color="yellow">It feels so refreshing!</font>

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
<font color="yellow">Grandma, eat a lot of meat.</font>

95
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:58,825
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

96
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,818
<font color="yellow">Mom, you eat, too.</font>

97
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,124
<font color="yellow">Aunt, you eat a lot, too.</font>

98
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,729
<font color="yellow">You should eat a lot since you worked hard.</font>

99
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,111
<font color="yellow">Mom, you should eat a lot. I'll eat, too.</font>

100
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,136
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

101
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:14,680
<font color="yellow">The meat is tastier since Jang-go bought it.</font>

102
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:20,443
<font color="yellow">So you bought this meat today because you won the case?</font>

103
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:21,993
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandma.</font>

104
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:26,427
<font color="yellow">I see. Then you don't have to worry about the office rent anymore?</font>

105
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,410
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

106
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:34,924
<font color="yellow">The money hasn't come in yet, but it will.</font>

107
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,465
<font color="yellow">Mom, eat a lot!</font>

108
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:39,164
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

109
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:42,794
<font color="yellow">But what about Jang-soo?</font>

110
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,283
<font color="yellow">Aunt, did you call Jang-soo?</font>

111
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,422
<font color="yellow">He said he'll be here soon.</font>

112
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,288
<font color="yellow">Oh, Jang-soo is here! Hurry up and come sit here!</font>

113
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,406
<font color="yellow">We have the pork belly you like so much.</font>

114
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,475
<font color="yellow">We have a guest.</font>

115
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,508
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

116
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,649
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

117
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:06,563
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

118
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,172
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

119
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,812
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, Ms. Song?</font>

120
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:24,343
<font color="yellow">Oh, are you the owner of the beauty parlor on the side of the street?</font>

121
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,221
<font color="yellow">That's right! It's her!</font>

122
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,255
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

123
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:31,313
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo.</font>

124
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:35,781
<font color="yellow">Everyone, don't be surprised.</font>

125
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,273
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri is my girlfriend.</font>

126
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:41,844
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry her.</font>

127
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,625
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat first.</font>

128
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,369
<font color="yellow">You can't sit down!</font>

129
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,891
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

130
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,956
<font color="yellow">What? You're going to get married? To who?</font>

131
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,251
<font color="yellow">With Ms. Song?</font>

132
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:09,469
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

133
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,946
<font color="yellow">-Jang-soo, you crazy fool! -Geum-sil!</font>

134
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:13,164
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

135
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,721
<font color="yellow">Ms. Song, aren't you over forty years old?</font>

136
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,009
<font color="yellow">Aunt!</font>

137
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:22,101
<font color="yellow">She's not over forty! She's exactly forty years old! She's only forty years old!</font>

138
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,347
<font color="yellow">She's only forty years old?</font>

139
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,374
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes any sense?</font>

140
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:33,929
<font color="yellow">Do you not know how old Jang-soo is?</font>

141
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,525
<font color="yellow">She knows I'm twenty-nine years old.</font>

142
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,152
<font color="yellow">But what does age gap have to do with anything?</font>

143
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:40,906
<font color="yellow">Our hearts are important.</font>

144
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,978
<font color="yellow">And I'll be thirty soon!</font>

145
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,407
<font color="yellow">How dare you, you crazy fool!</font>

146
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,072
<font color="yellow">-Mom! -Geum-sil!</font>

147
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:51,595
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous!</font>

148
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,212
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

149
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,561
<font color="yellow">Look here, Ms. Song.</font>

150
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:59,174
<font color="yellow">You must really have no conscience.</font>

151
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:06,306
<font color="yellow">How dare you come after our pure baby Jang-soo?</font>

152
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:10,124
<font color="yellow">We have nothing else to say to you. Get out of this house at once. Get out!</font>

153
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,351
<font color="yellow">Grandma, why are you doing this to my Joo-ri?</font>

154
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:16,904
<font color="yellow">-What? -And grandma, I'm not a baby! I'm twenty-nine years old!</font>

155
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:21,744
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness, you crazy idiot!</font>

156
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,751
<font color="yellow">-You idiot! -Gosh, seriously!</font>

157
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:32,665
<font color="yellow">All this time, you cut my hair for free and were really friendly to me.</font>

158
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:37,134
<font color="yellow">Was that all because you wanted to seduce Jang-soo?</font>

159
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:39,830
<font color="yellow">Get out of my house at once!</font>

160
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,300
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out at once!</font>

161
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,736
<font color="yellow">It's not like that!</font>

162
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:46,950
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri! Song Joo-ri!</font>

163
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,048
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri!</font>

164
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,651
<font color="yellow">-Oh my gosh. -This is ridiculous!</font>

165
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,441
<font color="yellow">-Oh my goodness. -Mom!</font>

166
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,040
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri! Song Joo-ri!</font>

167
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:07,306
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri!</font>

168
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,017
<font color="yellow">Wasn't Ms. Song married once?</font>

169
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:34,556
<font color="yellow">That's not all. She has two kids, too. A son and a daughter.</font>

170
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

171
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,254
<font color="yellow">She has kids?</font>

172
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,712
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

173
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:40,234
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

174
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,728
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

175
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,446
<font color="yellow">She has kids.</font>

176
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,578
<font color="yellow">Is Jang-soo out of his mind?</font>

177
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,287
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo is out of his mind. He's crazy!</font>

178
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:50,993
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

179
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,164
<font color="yellow">-Get out! How dare you come inside! -Mom!</font>

180
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,078
<font color="yellow">Am I kid? Use your words! Your words!</font>

181
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,767
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes. Just use your words.</font>

182
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,665
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, Ms. Song has kids.</font>

183
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:17,724
<font color="yellow">That's not right, Jang-soo!</font>

184
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:22,287
<font color="yellow">People marry people from different countries, so age gap doesn't really matter.</font>

185
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,579
<font color="yellow">But what are you going to do about her kids?</font>

186
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,388
<font color="yellow">Will you raise them?</font>

187
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:27,884
<font color="yellow">Why? Can't I?</font>

188
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,502
<font color="yellow">I can raise them!</font>

189
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:30,962
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

190
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:32,748
<font color="yellow">Hey, Lee Jang-soo!</font>

191
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,759
<font color="yellow">Why? If they're the kids of the woman I love, they're my kids, too.</font>

192
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:40,600
<font color="yellow">And once I get married to Joo-ri, I'm going to tie it up!</font>

193
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,220
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to have kids!</font>

194
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,814
<font color="yellow">-Oh my goodness! -What? Tie what up?</font>

195
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,329
<font color="yellow">That thing! He's going to have that surgery where you can't have kids anymore!</font>

196
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,149
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

197
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:59,080
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, you've gone completely mad!</font>

198
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:05,182
<font color="yellow">What on earth did that old fox do to him to bewitch him like this? Jang-soo!</font>

199
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:08,001
<font color="yellow">Grandma, don't talk about her like that!</font>

200
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,565
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri is the woman I like.</font>

201
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,654
<font color="yellow">She's the woman I love!</font>

202
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,168
<font color="yellow">She's the only person who understands my dreams and talents of becoming an actor.</font>

203
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:23,055
<font color="yellow">She said she would make money and feed me until I succeed.</font>

204
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:28,615
<font color="yellow">And grandma, Joo-ri didn't bewitch me. I was the one who begged her to date me!</font>

205
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,301
<font color="yellow">I was the first one to tell her that I like her and</font>

206
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,283
<font color="yellow">I was the first one to tell her that I love her!</font>

207
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,796
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri's parents were against us, but I finally</font>

208
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,673
<font color="yellow">got permission after I knelt before them!</font>

209
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,642
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

210
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,407
<font color="yellow">Die. You should just die instead!</font>

211
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,830
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

212
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,548
<font color="yellow">Use your words!</font>

213
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:51,892
<font color="yellow">Is it a crime to love someone?</font>

214
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:57,579
<font color="yellow">-What did I do so wrong? -Grandma!</font>

215
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,594
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, be quiet, will you?</font>

216
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,470
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri is such a kind woman!</font>

217
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,650
<font color="yellow">Is it a crime to love someone?</font>

218
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,226
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve to talk back to me! What are you, a little kid?</font>

219
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,393
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, do you know about love?</font>

220
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,212
<font color="yellow">Do you know about love?</font>

221
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,110
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything.</font>

222
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:28,277
<font color="yellow">There's no solution for you.</font>

223
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:32,891
<font color="yellow">If you're going to curse someone, you should curse me! Why curse my nice Joo-ri?</font>

224
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,672
<font color="yellow">How can he become so crazy?</font>

225
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,442
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?</font>

226
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,915
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault!</font>

227
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,533
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

228
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,099
<font color="yellow">Ever since Jang-soo was little, you would only take</font>

229
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:49,486
<font color="yellow">care of Jang-go and leave Jang-soo out in the dust.</font>

230
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,416
<font color="yellow">Because of the lack of affection, he fell for an old woman!</font>

231
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,649
<font color="yellow">Mom, stop it. Geum-sil is upset enough already.</font>

232
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,924
<font color="yellow">Aren't I telling the truth?</font>

233
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,963
<font color="yellow">Because you stopped Jang-soo from becoming an actor,</font>

234
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,602
<font color="yellow">he fell for that old woman who encouraged him on!</font>

235
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:19,805
<font color="yellow">Mother, you can't say that just because he isn't your son.</font>

236
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,250
<font color="yellow">If he was your son, would you have allowed him to become a stage actor?</font>

237
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,106
<font color="yellow">He doesn't make proper money from that, and</font>

238
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:27,003
<font color="yellow">all he does is stick posters on street lamps!</font>

239
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,891
<font color="yellow">What? Jang-soo is your son?</font>

240
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:32,242
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo is my son. My son.</font>

241
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:38,777
<font color="yellow">He's my son who I raised in my arms while you left him behind to do business!</font>

242
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,406
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

243
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

244
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:45,573
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo is not my son anymore. He's your son,</font>

245
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,735
<font color="yellow">so you can take him out of this house and let him do whatever he wants.</font>

246
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,316
<font color="yellow">He can become a stage actor or get married to that divorcee with children.</font>

247
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:57,526
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Are you telling me to leave this house?</font>

248
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:02,172
<font color="yellow">-Mom! That's not what she means! Go to your room!-You!</font>

249
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:07,168
<font color="yellow">My son bought this house with money he worked hard to make!</font>

250
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:10,988
<font color="yellow">Who are you to tell me to leave this house!</font>

251
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:15,873
<font color="yellow">-How dare you tell me to leave! -What's wrong with you?</font>

252
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:32,438
<font color="yellow">Mommy, hurry up!</font>

253
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:33,464
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

254
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:41,357
<font color="yellow">It's hot, so be careful.</font>

255
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,026
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

256
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,704
<font color="yellow">There you go! Here.</font>

257
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,226
<font color="yellow">This is okay, right?</font>

258
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,679
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's perfect!</font>

259
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,605
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, starting from tomorrow, we're going</font>

260
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,529
<font color="yellow">to live in a house that has a lot of warm water.</font>

261
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:05,846
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

262
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,425
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes, or they'll sting.</font>

263
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,507
<font color="yellow">The new house that we're moving into isn't a semi-basement</font>

264
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,443
<font color="yellow">like this one, so there will be plenty of sunshine and wind.</font>

265
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:18,310
<font color="yellow">Sounds great, right?</font>

266
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,335
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

267
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,825
<font color="yellow">You're so cute, Yoo-sung!</font>

268
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,971
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

269
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,754
<font color="yellow">I knew you would be like this.</font>

270
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:07,057
<font color="yellow">After losing your dad in a car accident,</font>

271
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,506
<font color="yellow">I thought I had lived pretty well.</font>

272
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:17,997
<font color="yellow">Today he's on my mind a lot.</font>

273
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,838
<font color="yellow">If your dad had been alive,</font>

274
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,365
<font color="yellow">I wonder what he would have said about what happened tonight.</font>

275
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,907
<font color="yellow">You still have me by your side.</font>

276
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,076
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

277
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:36,693
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

278
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:40,192
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Jang-soo too much.</font>

279
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:43,356
<font color="yellow">After a few days pass, I'll talk to him about it.</font>

280
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,846
<font color="yellow">No matter what we tell him right now, he won't listen.</font>

281
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,371
<font color="yellow">So just let it go.</font>

282
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,451
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

283
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,865
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

284
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:57,684
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

285
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,785
<font color="yellow">I can't fall asleep thinking about moving tomorrow.</font>

286
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:17,216
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

287
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,834
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, you need to hurry up and sleep so that we can</font>

288
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,669
<font color="yellow">move tomorrow. If you don't sleep, tomorrow won't come.</font>

289
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,447
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

290
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,255
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

291
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:33,966
<font color="yellow">You worked so hard all this time.</font>

292
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,082
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

293
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,560
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, you were the one who worked hard.</font>

294
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:50,748
<font color="yellow">Grandma, why do you keep calling aunt "Seung-hee?"</font>

295
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,318
<font color="yellow">Aunt's name is Mi-poong. Kim Mi-poong.</font>

296
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,973
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're right.</font>

297
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,385
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

298
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:05,194
<font color="yellow">But why do you, my smarty-pants, call your aunt "mommy?"</font>

299
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,346
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

300
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:10,182
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

301
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:15,198
<font color="yellow">Because I fed you milk, carried you on my back, and bathed you.</font>

302
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,761
<font color="yellow">I am your mommy, right?</font>

303
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,617
<font color="yellow">You can call me whatever you want.</font>

304
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,544
<font color="yellow">What will you do if you never get married because of that?</font>

305
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:24,870
<font color="yellow">What else will I do?</font>

306
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:30,518
<font color="yellow">I'll keep living with you and Yoo-sung.</font>

307
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,385
<font color="yellow">You really can't fall asleep? Huh?</font>

308
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:43,558
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

309
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

310
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:48,965
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

311
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:50,933
<font color="yellow">Exhale.</font>

312
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:52,379
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

313
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,222
<font color="yellow">Elder, when you're exercising, breathing is very important.</font>

314
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:01,778
<font color="yellow">When you lower your arm, you should exhale like this.</font>

315
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:03,808
<font color="yellow">Yes, just like that.</font>

316
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,831
<font color="yellow">When I pull up my arm, I need to inhale?</font>

317
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:10,069
<font color="yellow">Okay. Inhale.</font>

318
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:12,659
<font color="yellow">Exhale.</font>

319
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,308
<font color="yellow">I really hate that song.</font>

320
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,519
<font color="yellow">Who on earth made that kind of song?</font>

321
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,972
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone trying to live until they're a hundred years old?</font>

322
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

323
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:39,612
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated.</font>

324
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:47,784
<font color="yellow">"Ask him when I'll naturally be able to go."</font>

325
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,004
<font color="yellow">Is the green vegetable juice not done yet? Elder is thirsty.</font>

326
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,712
<font color="yellow">For how much longer are you going to call him "Elder?"</font>

327
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:58,897
<font color="yellow">If we decided to serve him as a father, then you should call him father.</font>

328
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,811
<font color="yellow">Is it so hard to call him father?</font>

329
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:05,732
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting mad at me over nothing so early in the morning?</font>

330
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,821
<font color="yellow">This is "nothing?"</font>

331
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:14,495
<font color="yellow">You need to call him father so that he'll think of you as his child!</font>

332
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,576
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense and hurry up!</font>

333
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:21,388
<font color="yellow">Stop turning on that song.</font>

334
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:23,394
<font color="yellow">I'm getting sick of it.</font>

335
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:29,820
<font color="yellow">Do you really want father to live until he's a hundred years old?</font>

336
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,185
<font color="yellow">Then?</font>

337
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,005
<font color="yellow">You don't?</font>

338
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:37,787
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

339
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,919
<font color="yellow">I just heard it's not good if you live for so long.</font>

340
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,706
<font color="yellow">They say longevity is a disaster.</font>

341
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,542
<font color="yellow">Don't you read the newspaper?</font>

342
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:52,731
<font color="yellow">You need to live moderately. That's order.</font>

343
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:54,435
<font color="yellow">Stop talking crap!</font>

344
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:58,294
<font color="yellow">Crap?</font>

345
00:22:59,802 --> 00:23:02,536
<font color="yellow">Did he just say that I'm talking crap?</font>

346
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,895
<font color="yellow">Elder, you're thirsty, aren't you?</font>

347
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,763
<font color="yellow">Drink this.</font>

348
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:23,940
<font color="yellow">Today, I mixed enough carrots and apples together, so it won't taste bitter.</font>

349
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:25,232
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

350
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

351
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:29,185
<font color="yellow">Let me try.</font>

352
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

353
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:43,706
<font color="yellow">Father, how's your condition today?</font>

354
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:46,941
<font color="yellow">Are you uncomfortable anywhere?</font>

355
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:52,649
<font color="yellow">I feel great. Thanks to you, I'll be living for a long time.</font>

356
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:54,615
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

357
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:57,602
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

358
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:01,551
<font color="yellow">You need to live a long life until you're two hundred years old!</font>

359
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:02,794
<font color="yellow">Two hundred?</font>

360
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:10,023
<font color="yellow">It's an insult to tell old people to live for a long time.</font>

361
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,552
<font color="yellow">But as for me,</font>

362
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,025
<font color="yellow">I won't ask for more or less.</font>

363
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:23,731
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live until we're unified and I can step onto my home country.</font>

364
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:25,999
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

365
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:29,995
<font color="yellow">You need to be healthy until then, so drink up.</font>

366
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:31,701
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

367
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,037
<font color="yellow">I'll drink it.</font>

368
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,312
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. So is he saying he'll live over a hundred</font>

369
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:43,404
<font color="yellow">years old if the countries aren't unified?</font>

370
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,606
<font color="yellow">When on earth will that unification happen?</font>

371
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:02,513
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

372
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,021
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to grandfather about it?</font>

373
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,576
<font color="yellow">Talk to him about what?</font>

374
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,931
<font color="yellow">About buying me a fashion shop in Cheongdam-dong.</font>

375
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:14,035
<font color="yellow">Cheongdam-dong fashion shop, my foot.</font>

376
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,616
<font color="yellow">I sent you to study abroad, but you didn't even graduate. Shop, my foot!</font>

377
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,476
<font color="yellow">Why do I need to graduate to own a shop? All I need is money!</font>

378
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,787
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Where did you get your stubbornness from?</font>

379
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:29,816
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm really confident about it!</font>

380
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,309
<font color="yellow">Although I didn't graduate,</font>

381
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:35,291
<font color="yellow">but I lived in New York! I have those senses!</font>

382
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,994
<font color="yellow">What's more important for my career than the fact that I was once a New Yorker?</font>

383
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:43,003
<font color="yellow">You didn't even study. You shopped and played around</font>

384
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:45,575
<font color="yellow">while spending money. Is that part of your career?</font>

385
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:51,731
<font color="yellow">I had such a hard time gathering money for your expenses when you were living abroad!</font>

386
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,846
<font color="yellow">Grandfather paid for the tuition.</font>

387
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,817
<font color="yellow">Tuition wasn't the only thing wasted on you!</font>

388
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:59,004
<font color="yellow">I borrowed money without your dad or grandfather knowing in</font>

389
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,138
<font color="yellow">order to cover up for your costs of living as a New Yorker!</font>

390
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,398
<font color="yellow">That's why I'll pay you back once I make money.</font>

391
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:08,904
<font color="yellow">Don't even lie.</font>

392
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,412
<font color="yellow">Mom! Shop! Shop! Mom! Shop!</font>

393
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,347
<font color="yellow">What if grandfather finds out you didn't even graduate?</font>

394
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:19,763
<font color="yellow">If you get on grandfather's bad side, it will be the end of you!</font>

395
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,161
<font color="yellow">If you don't have any brains, the least you should have is some tact!</font>

396
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,090
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Who would know how I feel?</font>

397
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,756
<font color="yellow">No one else will know that I didn't graduate as long as you and Hee-dong stay silent.</font>

398
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:32,802
<font color="yellow">The two of you are the only ones who know.</font>

399
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:34,232
<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

400
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,988
<font color="yellow">Go and wake up your brother for breakfast!</font>

401
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:44,824
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for Hee-dong, mom wouldn't have found out I hadn't graduated either.</font>

402
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:47,552
<font color="yellow">Shit!</font>

403
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:00,123
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-dong.</font>

404
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,377
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-dong, you better wake up.</font>

405
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:11,820
<font color="yellow">How can you act so rudely to your big brother?</font>

406
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,699
<font color="yellow">Brother, my foot.</font>

407
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,434
<font color="yellow">You rag-like blabbermouth!</font>

408
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:18,538
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

409
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:20,468
<font color="yellow">Rag-like?</font>

410
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:24,059
<font color="yellow">You went to go study abroad after begging and</font>

411
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:26,531
<font color="yellow">begging the adults that you wanted to study design.</font>

412
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:32,293
<font color="yellow">Grandfather and father have no clue yet that you didn't graduate, do they?</font>

413
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,335
<font color="yellow">Grandfather! Father! She-</font>

414
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:38,703
<font color="yellow">Don't do it! Don't do it!</font>

415
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,993
<font color="yellow">Watch what happens if you tell them!</font>

416
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,749
<font color="yellow">Please don't do that.</font>

417
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,000
<font color="yellow">If grandfather and dad finds out, they'll be so disappointed.</font>

418
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:51,945
<font color="yellow">Please!</font>

419
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,544
<font color="yellow">Big brother.</font>

420
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,154
<font color="yellow">Big brother.</font>

421
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,015
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go get me some water.</font>

422
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,031
<font color="yellow">I'm very thirsty.</font>

423
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,070
<font color="yellow">Got it.</font>

424
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:14,312
<font color="yellow">Watch.</font>

425
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:17,715
<font color="yellow">I'll get you back.</font>

426
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,202
<font color="yellow">(Fasting)</font>

427
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,079
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo said he's not going to eat.</font>

428
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:48,527
<font color="yellow">Why not? If he doesn't feel like eating, he should</font>

429
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,721
<font color="yellow">have some of this beansprout soup at least.</font>

430
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:51,976
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

431
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,171
<font color="yellow">he's not just saying he won't eat.</font>

432
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,975
<font color="yellow">He said he would rather die of starvation if we don't allow him to marry Ms. Song.</font>

433
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,820
<font color="yellow">He said he would go on a hunger strike until we give them permission.</font>

434
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:03,458
<font color="yellow">What? A hunger strike?</font>

435
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,722
<font color="yellow">He can starve to death if he wants. He can get married to Ms. Song if he wants.</font>

436
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,568
<font color="yellow">He's not my son anymore, so tell him to do whatever he wants.</font>

437
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:16,413
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that towards me?</font>

438
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:18,882
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

439
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:22,015
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and pig out by yourself.</font>

440
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,663
<font color="yellow">If Jang-soo starves to death, so will I.</font>

441
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:28,242
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

442
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,288
<font color="yellow">Why is she acting like this now?</font>

443
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:37,319
<font color="yellow">Don't mind him. Jang-soo will stop soon enough.</font>

444
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:39,635
<font color="yellow">It just doesn't make sense!</font>

445
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:42,046
<font color="yellow">What about Jang-go?</font>

446
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,919
<font color="yellow">He went out early to the police station for work.</font>

447
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:48,847
<font color="yellow">Oh, it must be because of that grandmother yesterday.</font>

448
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:52,061
<font color="yellow">Every day he only works on such small cases.</font>

449
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:54,894
<font color="yellow">Jang-go needs to do something that will make money.</font>

450
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:00,520
<font color="yellow">Hi, Young-soon.</font>

451
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:02,479
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling me so early in the morning?</font>

452
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:04,453
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

453
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,218
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

454
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:09,477
<font color="yellow">Of course he can take that case!</font>

455
00:30:10,406 --> 00:30:13,455
<font color="yellow">Okay, then bring him so my son's office later today.</font>

456
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,856
<font color="yellow">I'll send you the address through a text message.</font>

457
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,583
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later!</font>

458
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,796
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Did Jang-go get a new case?</font>

459
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:24,374
<font color="yellow">My friend's brother-in-law runs some kind of business,</font>

460
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,977
<font color="yellow">but the product he has been creating for over ten years</font>

461
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,999
<font color="yellow">has been copied and released by another company.</font>

462
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:32,085
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! So he's going to leave such a big case in Jang-go's hands?</font>

463
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,515
<font color="yellow">It's a big case?</font>

464
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,875
<font color="yellow">Of course! Not everyone can handle such a big case!</font>

465
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,765
<font color="yellow">Those are only cases that can be gotten through lobbying by skillful office managers.</font>

466
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:41,866
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

467
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:43,741
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't just sit around like this.</font>

468
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:48,912
<font color="yellow">Wait for me! Oh my goodness! It was such a big case? Oh my.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Seoul Law Office)</font>

470
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,285
<font color="yellow">Thank you for introducing such a big case to Jang-go.</font>

471
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:59,171
<font color="yellow">If this works out well, make sure to buy a big meal for your friend.</font>

472
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,547
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

473
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:02,483
<font color="yellow">I'll buy two or three meals.</font>

474

<font color="yellow">Thank you so much, Young-soon.</font>

475
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,079
<font color="yellow">It has to work out well.</font>

476
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:09,278
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is very competent. It'll definitely work out well.</font>

477
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:13,022
<font color="yellow">Maybe he can't find this place.</font>

478
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:15,404
<font color="yellow">Why don't you call him?</font>

479
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:17,804
<font color="yellow">I got a call.</font>

480
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

481
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,009
<font color="yellow">Okay, I understand.</font>

482
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:29,398
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

483
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,046
<font color="yellow">He decided to leave his lawsuit up to Jangaenggo Law Firm.</font>

484
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:37,373
<font color="yellow">It's such an important matter for the company.</font>

485
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:39,952
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

486
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,398
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

487
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:44,366
<font color="yellow">I hope it gets solved nicely.</font>

488
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Geum-sil.</font>

489
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,145
<font color="yellow">I'll call you next time.</font>

490
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:58,147
<font color="yellow">"Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear!</font>

491
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:03,310
<font color="yellow">Daddy bear is fat!</font>

492
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:08,241
<font color="yellow">Mommy bear is skinny!</font>

493
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:13,024
<font color="yellow">Baby bear is so pretty!</font>

494
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:17,852
<font color="yellow">Shrug, shrug. You are growing tall!"</font>

495
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,659
<font color="yellow">I wasted your time. I'm sorry.</font>

496
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:30,382
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's fine.</font>

497
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:33,046
<font color="yellow">Aunt, I'm going to the court.</font>

498
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:34,903
<font color="yellow">-Bye. -Bye.</font>

499
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:40,523
<font color="yellow">So what if he has skills? He has no connections.</font>

500
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:43,497
<font color="yellow">Everyone looks down on him because this office is so small.</font>

501
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:50,221
<font color="yellow">He needs to either get married to a wealthy woman or hire a skillful office manager.</font>

502
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,210
<font color="yellow">Jang-go's skills are too wasteful to be stuck in here.</font>

503
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,012
<font color="yellow">In order to try something, he needs an opportunity!</font>

504
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,006
<font color="yellow">The truth is, a matchmaker introduced him to a wealthy business</font>

505
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:02,818
<font color="yellow">family, but Jang-go said no, so we quit the whole thing.</font>

506
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:07,101
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, you should have still pushed him to do it!</font>

507
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:10,473
<font color="yellow">Jang-go would become big if someone just supported him!</font>

508
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,647
<font color="yellow">Try this just once.</font>

511
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:29,492
<font color="yellow">Grandma, don't test my love.</font>

512
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:31,624
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to eat it even if I die.</font>

513
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:33,695
<font color="yellow">You can just pretend you didn't eat.</font>

514
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:40,586
<font color="yellow">I'll take this secret to my grave. So just take one bite.</font>

515
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,002
<font color="yellow">Good. That's it.</font>

516
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:46,673
<font color="yellow">Really, grandma?</font>

517
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,647
<font color="yellow">-You really have to take this secret to the grave. Okay? -Yes.</font>

518
00:33:51,202 --> 00:33:56,232
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say that you're going to tie it up again.</font>

519
00:33:56,552 --> 00:34:02,552
<font color="yellow">The day you tie that up will be my death day. Got it?</font>

520
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,443
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly.</font>

521
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:12,146
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

522
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,490
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

523
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,126
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who's eating this.</font>

524
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,501
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo didn't even take a bite.</font>

525
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,285
<font color="yellow">Darn it! Grandma, I said I wouldn't eat it!</font>

526

537
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:10,509
<font color="yellow">Conned?</font>

538
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:13,235
<font color="yellow">This house has been put up for auction ever since the owners were</font>

539
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,001
<font color="yellow">indebted to the bank. You were conned into signing a fake contract.</font>

<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

541

542
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:25,875
<font color="yellow">Then your close friend must have teamed up with the con-artists.</font>

<font color="yellow">Ma'am, go inside.</font>

00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:28,868
<font color="yellow">Teamed up?</font>

545
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,219

<font color="yellow">Let me go meet my friend. Wait right here.</font>

553
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,591
<font color="yellow">It's nearby, so I'll be back soon.</font>

554
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:15,375
<font color="yellow">Open the door! Come out!</font>

555
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:17,938

<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

558
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:26,309
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't know that.</font>

559
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,028

<font color="yellow">What's the point of living a worthless life that's lower than dirt?</font>

753
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:01,219
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's wrong with you?</font>

754
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,695
<font color="yellow">Don't be like this. Please!</font>

755
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:11,970
<font color="yellow">I can't handle this any longer!</font>

756
00:53:13,435 --> 00:53:15,717
<font color="yellow">The three of us should just die together.</font>

757
00:53:16,544 --> 00:53:22,387
<font color="yellow">We can go meet your brother and your father.</font>

758
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:24,607
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

759
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:27,170
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard life is,</font>

760
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,127
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't say that to me.</font>

761
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:33,304
<font color="yellow">We worked so hard to come this far!</font>

762
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:40,371
<font color="yellow">We survived when that wench Kang Mi-Jung fled with our money.</font>

763
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:45,294
<font color="yellow">We survived when we had to beg on the streets in China.</font>

764
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,301
<font color="yellow">We even survived...</font>

765
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:55,161
<font color="yellow">when we saw father and brother being shot to death in front of our eyes.</font>

766
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:59,943
<font color="yellow">But now you want to give up?</font>

767
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:03,614
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, I...</font>

768
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:09,122
<font color="yellow">feel like this is all just a dream.</font>

769
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:13,216
<font color="yellow">A nightmare that I won't be able to wake up from unless I die.</font>

770
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:15,822
<font color="yellow">Mom, this isn't a dream.</font>

771
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:17,829
<font color="yellow">This isn't a dream.</font>

772
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:21,311
<font color="yellow">This is reality that we must overcome!</font>

773
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,465
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee...</font>

774
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,137
<font color="yellow">Mom, what did dad say?</font>

775
00:54:27,021 --> 00:54:30,964
<font color="yellow">He told us that we had to live no matter what!</font>

776
00:54:32,497 --> 00:54:33,497
<font color="yellow">We can do this.</font>

777
00:54:34,435 --> 00:54:35,825
<font color="yellow">We can survive through this.</font>

778
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:39,770
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee.</font>

779
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:41,888
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

780
00:55:35,653 --> 00:55:36,653
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

781
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:40,107
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

782
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,755
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

783
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:53,950
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok.</font>

784
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,853
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time left.</font>

785
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:06,824
<font color="yellow">Wait a little bit longer.</font>

786
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:08,881
<font color="yellow">Just a little longer.</font>

787
00:57:38,256 --> 00:57:40,434
<font color="yellow">Well, the thing is...</font>

788
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,005
<font color="yellow">I wanted to check if you and I were meant to be.</font>

789
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:46,385
<font color="yellow">I don't want to!</font>

790
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:50,678
<font color="yellow">I can't go! I'll never go until I hear that song!</font>

791
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,107
<font color="yellow">Stay here by yourself.</font>

792
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,435
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me for help even when a ghost appears.</font>

793
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:06,849
<font color="yellow">-It's a ghost! -It's a ghost!</font>

794
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:07,874
<font color="yellow">Help!</font>

795
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:55,165
<font color="yellow">Come on now. How can you do this in a park?</font>

796
00:58:57,803 --> 00:58:59,956
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. We have nowhere else to go.</font>

797
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:02,159
<font color="yellow">We'll go as soon as we get a place.</font>

798
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:05,330
<font color="yellow">-Please let it slide. -If we could, we would.</font>

799
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,927
<font color="yellow">We're getting complaints that someone set up a home underneath the bridge.</font>

800
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:12,053
<font color="yellow">Excuse me! Hold on!</font>

801
00:59:13,396 --> 00:59:14,396
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jung?</font>

802
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:17,514
<font color="yellow">Oh, hi mister!</font>

803
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:18,693
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

804
00:59:19,029 --> 00:59:21,191
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of this matter.</font>

805
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:24,591
<font color="yellow">-(Home of Free Immigrants. Name: Jung Woo-Jin.) Don't worry.</font>

806
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,110
<font color="yellow">Then we'll leave it up to you.</font>

807
00:59:36,912 --> 00:59:38,045
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim Mi-poong,</font>

808
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:41,407
<font color="yellow">why didn't you contact me when things have become so terrible for you?</font>

809
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:44,606
<font color="yellow">I felt so bad that you always had to help us.</font>

810
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:47,487
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Why would you feel bad about this?</font>

811
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,227
<font color="yellow">It's my job to make sure you and your family live well in this country.</font>

812
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:55,516
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I found a temporary place for you to live in, so let's go there first.</font>

813
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:57,898
<font color="yellow">You'll do as I say, right?</font>

814
01:00:44,646 --> 01:00:46,134
<font color="yellow">-Hello. -Hello.</font>

815
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:48,139
<font color="yellow">Sorry for troubling you.</font>

816
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:49,978
<font color="yellow">It's no trouble at all.</font>

817
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,896
<font color="yellow">It's an empty storage room anyways.</font>

818
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,561
<font color="yellow">Is Mr. Kim in today?</font>

819
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:55,177
<font color="yellow">I would like to say hi.</font>

820
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:56,912
<font color="yellow">He's not here today.</font>

821
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,467
<font color="yellow">I'll tell him you said hi.</font>

822
01:00:59,998 --> 01:01:00,998
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

823
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:08,909
<font color="yellow">I heard your story from Mr. Jung.</font>

824
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:11,560
<font color="yellow">How did something so terrible happen to you?</font>

825
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:15,770
<font color="yellow">You can stay here comfortably until you find a new home.</font>

826
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:19,425
<font color="yellow">I don't know how we can pay you back.</font>

827
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,913
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

828
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:27,209
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

829
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:32,592
<font color="yellow">Go on in.</font>

830
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,201
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

831
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:56,177
<font color="yellow">She did seem a bit immature, but she was bright and pretty.</font>

832
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,450
<font color="yellow">Speaking of the devil...</font>

833
01:02:03,779 --> 01:02:04,779
<font color="yellow">Hi, Chung-ja.</font>

834
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:08,895
<font color="yellow">I'm so grateful about yesterday that I think I should pay you back.</font>

835
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:13,560
<font color="yellow">Come on. You don't need to pay me back when we're friends.</font>

836
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:16,444
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm grateful and sorry to you.</font>

837
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:19,885
<font color="yellow">Then buy my son dinner.</font>

838
01:02:20,943 --> 01:02:23,287
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow? Sure, that's fine.</font>

839
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:28,474
<font color="yellow">My son won't have any fun eating with just you and me.</font>

840
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:32,234
<font color="yellow">Your daughter seems to have a bright personality. Bring her out with you.</font>

841
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:34,994
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you tomorrow.</font>

842
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:39,623
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

843
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:41,201
<font color="yellow">I did well.</font>

844
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:44,974
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make Hee-Ra into Jang-go's wife.</font>

845
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:50,186
<font color="yellow">If Jang-go gets support from wealthy in-laws, he'll be able to thrive in his work.</font>

846
01:02:50,779 --> 01:02:53,732
<font color="yellow">It'll be good for Chung-ja since they'll have a lawyer as a son-in-law.</font>

847
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:00,324
<font color="yellow">I'm going to create a sturdy support system for Jang-go.</font>

848
01:03:09,357 --> 01:03:12,181
<font color="yellow">Mom, lie down.</font>

849
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:18,693
<font color="yellow">Yes. This is a much better place than under that bridge.</font>

850
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:25,253
<font color="yellow">But Yoo-sung, what's wrong?</font>

851
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:28,568
<font color="yellow">Aunt, does this mean I can't go to kindergarten anymore?</font>

852
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:30,993
<font color="yellow">Why not? You can go.</font>

853
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,903
<font color="yellow">It's too far from here.</font>

854
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:36,996
<font color="yellow">It's not far at all.</font>

855
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:39,568
<font color="yellow">If you ride a bus, you'll be there in no time.</font>

856
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:45,595
<font color="yellow">Grandma and I will take you to kindergarten every day.</font>

857
01:03:45,975 --> 01:03:46,975
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

858
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:48,553
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

859
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:52,109
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, stay here with grandma.</font>

860
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:56,972
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

861
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:03,025
<font color="yellow">Well, I saw a law office on the third floor of this building.</font>

862
01:04:03,693 --> 01:04:06,611
<font color="yellow">I want to ask if there's a way I can get my money back.</font>

863
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,606
<font color="yellow">We need to get our money back, mom.</font>

864
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:25,556
<font color="yellow">Ms. Lawyer, that security deposit is money that we</font>

865
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:29,372
<font color="yellow">saved over the year while not eating and not shopping.</font>

866
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:30,912
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

867
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:33,417
<font color="yellow">Please help me get that money back.</font>

868
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:35,867
<font color="yellow">That's so pitiful.</font>

869
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:39,367
<font color="yellow">All right. We'll be able to come up with a way together.</font>

870
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:43,122
<font color="yellow">Thank you! Thank you, Ms. Lawyer!</font>

871
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,776
<font color="yellow">But I'm not a lawyer.</font>

872
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:48,596
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

873
01:04:49,779 --> 01:04:50,951
<font color="yellow">You're not a lawyer?</font>

874
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:54,326
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a law firm?</font>

875
01:04:55,013 --> 01:05:00,143
<font color="yellow">This is a law firm, but the lawyer is away for the moment. I'm the office manager.</font>

876
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:02,404
<font color="yellow">If you wait here for a moment-</font>

877
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:06,794
<font color="yellow">Speaking of the devil. He came right on time.</font>

878
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,800
<font color="yellow">You have a client.</font>

881
01:05:18,826 --> 01:05:21,162

<font color="yellow">No! Where the heck did she go?</font>

888
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:09,873
<font color="yellow">Your daughter is coming, too, right?</font>

889
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:11,823
<font color="yellow">Why is she so interested in Hee-Ra?</font>

890
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:14,084
<font color="yellow">There was this crazy psycho in the parking lot.</font>

891
01:06:14,109 --> 01:06:15,130
<font color="yellow">Crazy psycho?</font>

892
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:17,873
<font color="yellow">He blocked me so that I couldn't even move!</font>

893
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:20,224
<font color="yellow">I have no choice but to get the money from your husband.</font>

894
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:22,380
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back this week along with the interest.</font>

895
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:24,786
<font color="yellow">-Let go! -What are you doing to my friend?</font>

897
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:29,912
<font color="yellow">Get on. I'll give you a ride.</font>

898
01:06:29,937 --> 01:06:31,935
<font color="yellow">If you don't eat, you'll become a fish.</font>
