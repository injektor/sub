00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,270
<font color="yellow">- (Episode 39)
- This is the apartment in America
where the three of you will live in.</font>

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,823
<font color="yellow">It's close to Winner Group's
American headquarters.</font>

4
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:18,065
<font color="yellow">There is a foreign school nearby, too.</font>

5
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:21,218
<font color="yellow">Everything is prepared,
so you just have to choose</font>

6
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:23,456
<font color="yellow">the date you'll leave
and get your plane tickets.</font>

7
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:28,500
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, we're not going to America.</font>

8
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:32,733
<font color="yellow">What? You're not going to America?</font>

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,183
<font color="yellow">Are you stupid?
How can you lose a good opportunity like this?</font>

10
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:40,406
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, Mi-poong said
the wrong thing, didn't she?</font>

11
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:43,290
<font color="yellow">You're going to go to America, aren't you?</font>

12
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:47,598
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, we can't go to America.</font>

13
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:49,840
<font color="yellow">There's a reason we can't go.</font>

14
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:53,624
<font color="yellow">Why? Why can't you go? What's the reason?</font>

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,890
<font color="yellow">We think our father is in South Korea.</font>

16
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,602
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

17
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,774
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

18
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,000
<font color="yellow">My mom and I saw him.</font>

19
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:11,287
<font color="yellow">That's why we're going to find him.</font>

20
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:16,554
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you're going
to find your father?</font>

21
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,226
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo. Mi-poong.</font>

22
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,827
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim passed away at the Amnok River.</font>

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,751
<font color="yellow">But where did you see him?
What kind of nonsense are you saying?</font>

24
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,588
<font color="yellow">No, I definitely saw him,
and Mi-poong even made</font>

25
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:31,718
<font color="yellow">eye-contact with him at the amusement park.</font>

26
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,641
<font color="yellow">We didn't believe it in the beginning,
so you won't be able to believe it either.</font>

27
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,643
<font color="yellow">But he was really my husband.</font>

28
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,216
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

29
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:43,146
<font color="yellow">It's just someone who looks like him.</font>

30
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,375
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, thank you for
being concerned about us.</font>

31
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:51,409
<font color="yellow">However, my father might be alive,
so we can't go to such a far place.</font>

32
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:55,281
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- So you can give this chance to someone else.</font>

33
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:58,460
<font color="yellow">How can you do this?</font>

34
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:01,370
<font color="yellow">You said you were going
to go to America, Ms. Joo!</font>

35
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:03,710
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have said
you were going to go then!</font>

36
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,422
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard I worked to prepare this?</font>

37
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,121
<font color="yellow">I made a spot at the American headquarters
and signed the apartment contract!</font>

38
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,218
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, just go to America!</font>

39
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:15,077
<font color="yellow">You should think about Yoo-sung!</font>

40
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,632
<font color="yellow">What is there for you to do here?</font>

41
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,828
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae...</font>

42
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,226
<font color="yellow">calm down.</font>

43
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:27,794
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, there's no reason
for you to be so angry.</font>

44
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:30,724
<font color="yellow">We never begged you to
send us to America.</font>

45
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,656
<font color="yellow">Neither did we make
the final decision to go there.</font>

46
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,462
<font color="yellow">You planned and prepared this all by yourself.</font>

47
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:38,507
<font color="yellow">That's true...</font>

48
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,772
<font color="yellow">but Ms. Joo, you said
you were going to go to America.</font>

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,484
<font color="yellow">I said I would think about going.
I never said I would go.</font>

50
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,378
<font color="yellow">And even if we said we were going to go,</font>

51
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,825
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you tell us
that we should find my father?</font>

52
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,937
<font color="yellow">Finding my father is more
important than going to America.</font>

53
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,430
<font color="yellow">Or is there a different reason
why we must go to America?</font>

54
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,649
<font color="yellow">So you're really not going to America?</font>

55
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:13,213
<font color="yellow">Yes! We're not going to America!</font>

56
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,218
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, I'm sorry things turned out this way.</font>

57
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:22,773
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

58
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:29,831
<font color="yellow">Opportunities like this one don't come
by easily. Just don't regret it later on.</font>

59
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:37,149
<font color="yellow">And how on earth will you
be able to find your dead father?</font>

60
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:44,494
<font color="yellow">Mom, isn't she a bit strange?</font>

61
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,953
<font color="yellow">Is this something she has
to get so angry about?</font>

62
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:52,859
<font color="yellow">(We are looking for a person)</font>

63
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:23,984
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

64
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,967
<font color="yellow">What will I do about them?</font>

65
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,171
<font color="yellow">Is her daughter-in-law really an imposter?</font>

66
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:41,359
<font color="yellow">Her mother knows about it,
so wouldn't she know about it as well?</font>

67
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:46,046
<font color="yellow">Is Chung-ja playing along with it
even though she knows Shin-ae is an imposter?</font>

68
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,557
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

69
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,149
<font color="yellow">You said you had something to tell me.</font>

70
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,520
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why are you hesitating?</font>

71
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:57,734
<font color="yellow">Well, it's a bit difficult to believe...</font>

72
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:01,496
<font color="yellow">You're frustrating. What's wrong with you?</font>

73
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,281
<font color="yellow">Oh, fine.</font>

74
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:10,026
<font color="yellow">The truth is, your mother came to
my house yesterday and said something strange.</font>

75
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,497
<font color="yellow">What? My mother was here?</font>

76
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:16,806
<font color="yellow">What did she say that was so strange?</font>

77
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:20,359
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, I heard your daughter-in-law...</font>

78
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:25,742
<font color="yellow">is pretending to be
Mr. Kim's real granddaughter.</font>

79
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,531
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

80
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:31,465
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Oh, no!
What do we do?</font>

81
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,820
<font color="yellow">- You must've gotten burned! Are you all right?
- It's hot!</font>

82
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:37,029
<font color="yellow">- It's hot! Oh, no!
- I'm fine.</font>

83
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,885
<font color="yellow">What did my mom say?</font>

84
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,334
<font color="yellow">You must be really shocked.
You didn't know about it?</font>

85
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,984
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

86
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:48,226
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. You really didn't know about this.</font>

87
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:51,287
<font color="yellow">But if your daughter-in-law really is an</font>

88
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:54,149
<font color="yellow">imposter, shouldn't you do something about it?</font>

89
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:56,673
<font color="yellow">No matter how much
she coveted the huge inheritance,</font>

90
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:59,187
<font color="yellow">how can she try to fool bloodlines?</font>

91
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:00,773
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

92
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:04,687
<font color="yellow">That's a terrible thing to do to Mr. Kim.</font>

93
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,228
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that.</font>

94
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:10,322
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae really is his granddaughter.</font>

95
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:11,781
<font color="yellow">She is?</font>

96
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,360
<font color="yellow">Then why would your mom say such a thing?</font>

97
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,610
<font color="yellow">There's something weird going on!</font>

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,171
<font color="yellow">Did they do a DNA test?</font>

99
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:22,599
<font color="yellow">Of course they did!
He was looking for his bloodline.</font>

100
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,712
<font color="yellow">Don't you think he did that already?</font>

101
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,933
<font color="yellow">You know how Mr. Kim is.
Do you think he'll be lax about such a thing?</font>

102
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,926
<font color="yellow">Are you sure they're a 99.99% match?</font>

103
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,316
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

104
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:36,293
<font color="yellow">That was hot.</font>

105
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:40,105
<font color="yellow">I guess you're right.
He wouldn't have accepted her</font>

106
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:43,482
<font color="yellow">as his granddaughter
without doing a DNA test first.</font>

107
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:48,200
<font color="yellow">But why did your mom say such a thing?</font>

108
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,741
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't she be in trouble if
she went around saying things like that?</font>

109
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,350
<font color="yellow">Well, the truth is,
my mom is showing signs of dementia lately.</font>

110
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,968
<font color="yellow">What? She has dementia?</font>

111
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:08,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. So that's what happened.
I didn't know that, and I got the wrong idea.</font>

112
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:14,990
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I'll be going now.
I have to take my mom to the hospital today.</font>

113
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,894
<font color="yellow">Okay, go on.</font>

114
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,647
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

115
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,287
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

116
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:41,960
<font color="yellow">- Oh, I lost again! Woe is me!
- Mom!</font>

117
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:44,859
<font color="yellow">Mom, what the heck are you doing outside?</font>

118
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:48,817
<font color="yellow">What did you say to Hee-ra's
grandmother-in-law yesterday?</font>

119
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:56,797
<font color="yellow">I was so drunk yesterday,
so I don't remember what I said.</font>

120
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:02,305
<font color="yellow">I heard you revealed to her
that Shin-ae is an imposter!</font>

121
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:03,857
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

122
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:06,549
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to see me die?</font>

123
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:12,787
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, I told her that I made
a slip of the tongue because I was so drunk!</font>

124
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,966
<font color="yellow">I told her it was nothing like that!</font>

125
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,555
<font color="yellow">How could you do such a thing
when you never did anything great for me?</font>

126
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:21,872
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja...</font>

127
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,654
<font color="yellow">I get so sick and tired
when I think of the past!</font>

128
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,961
<font color="yellow">I never got to eat proper meat, and every
single day we had to eat the dough soup!</font>

129
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,321
<font color="yellow">At a young age,
I couldn't wear new clothes, and</font>

130
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,113
<font color="yellow">I always wore stockings with holes in them!</font>

131
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:43,291
<font color="yellow">Despite everything, I met Dal-ho,
and I was able to start living a proper life.</font>

132
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,339
<font color="yellow">What? I'm going to get punished?</font>

133
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,858
<font color="yellow">I told you I'm okay with getting punished.</font>

134
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:56,301
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because I don't want
to live a pathetic life anymore!</font>

135
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:57,987
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

136
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:03,557
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even do anything nice
for you as a parent, yet I just</font>

137
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,648
<font color="yellow">stick to you like glue and
give you nothing but a hard time.</font>

138
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:11,838
<font color="yellow">But Chung-ja, I'm doing this because
I'm worried you'll get in big trouble later.</font>

139
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,413
<font color="yellow">Eventually, lies will always be exposed.
That's how this world works.</font>

140
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:19,837
<font color="yellow">I don't have any inheritance
to leave you, but I just want to</font>

141
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,580
<font color="yellow">give you some words of wisdom
about what the world is like.</font>

142
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,945
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim's son has appeared now.</font>

143
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,049
<font color="yellow">One day, everyone will find out
Shin-ae is an imposter!</font>

144
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:36,679
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying frightful
things that make my heart burst?</font>

145
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,762
<font color="yellow">If you're going to be like this,
get out of this house!</font>

146
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:41,793
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae is an imposter?</font>

147
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:49,829
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae isn't my father's granddaughter?</font>

148
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,023
<font color="yellow">She's an imposter?</font>

149
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,776
<font color="yellow">Then Shin-ae isn't my daughter either?</font>

150
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,488
<font color="yellow">No, you misheard!</font>

151
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:02,659
<font color="yellow">Of course she's your daughter.
Whose daughter is she then?</font>

152
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,480
<font color="yellow">Whose granddaughter is she then?</font>

153
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,132
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chun just said that
Shin-ae is an imposter!</font>

154
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,128
<font color="yellow">I definitely heard her say that.
Why are you lying?</font>

155
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:19,344
<font color="yellow">Look here! When did I say that?</font>

156
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,988
<font color="yellow">I never said that before!</font>

157
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:24,232
<font color="yellow">I heard very clearly with my own two ears!</font>

158
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,103
<font color="yellow">I'm very offended!</font>

159
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:31,701
<font color="yellow">I'm going to call Shin-ae.</font>

160
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,717
<font color="yellow">When I press number one,
I'll be able to talk to my father.</font>

161
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:40,699
<font color="yellow">I'm going to call him and tell him
that you called Shin-ae an imposter!</font>

162
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:46,241
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no! What do we do, mom? No!
- Chung-ja!</font>

163
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:53,021
<font color="yellow">You evil woman! This is my cell-phone!</font>

164
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:57,797
<font color="yellow">I'm going to call Shin-ae!
I'm going to call my father!</font>

165
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,574
<font color="yellow">You're going to die if you call them!</font>

166
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,153
<font color="yellow">You evil woman! This is mine!</font>

167
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:06,067
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. What's going on?
Dad, what's wrong?</font>

168
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,511
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

169
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:14,259
<font color="yellow">That evil woman tried to take
my cell-phone so that I couldn't call you.</font>

170
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:19,183
<font color="yellow">Also, she said I was going
to die if I called you or father.</font>

171
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:22,267
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

172
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,487
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

173
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:29,275
<font color="yellow">And Ms. Chun said you were an imposter.</font>

174
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:32,427
<font color="yellow">Then those two had a fight about it.</font>

175
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,357
<font color="yellow">If you're not my father's granddaughter,
it means you're not my daughter either.</font>

176
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:42,808
<font color="yellow">I felt offended, so I was going to
call father, but that evil woman stopped me.</font>

177
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,669
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

178
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,401
<font color="yellow">what is he talking about?</font>

179
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:52,739
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, you misheard.</font>

180
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,568
<font color="yellow">No! I heard you very clearly
with my own two ears!</font>

181
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:01,071
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, I don't want
to live with such mean women.</font>

182
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:02,973
<font color="yellow">I hate them!</font>

183
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,841
<font color="yellow">They're so offensive!</font>

184
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,713
<font color="yellow">How can they call you an imposter?</font>

185
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,884
<font color="yellow">So hurry up and scold them, huh?</font>

186
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:20,502
<font color="yellow">The thing is, my mother has dementia,
so she was saying nonsense.</font>

187
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:23,926
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

188
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,284
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

189
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:33,317
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'll explain everything,
so let's go upstairs.</font>

190
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:35,652
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

191
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,586
<font color="yellow">My father said that
I'm the owner of this house!</font>

192
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,274
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

193
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,059
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

194
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:57,894
<font color="yellow">Yes, dad.</font>

195
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:01,769
<font color="yellow">Dementia is a disease when you grow old
and your brain doesn't function well.</font>

196
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:07,163
<font color="yellow">When you get dementia,
you start to say ridiculous nonsense.</font>

197
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:12,326
<font color="yellow">Just like how you're upset
that you don't remember anything,</font>

198
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,098
<font color="yellow">that grandmother says
strange nonsense sometimes,</font>

199
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:19,662
<font color="yellow">so they fought because they're upset.</font>

200
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,972
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

201
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:29,077
<font color="yellow">So you should understand her and
not feel offended. It's because she's sick.</font>

202
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:30,332
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

203
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:33,976
<font color="yellow">Since she's doing this because
her head hurts, I'll understand her.</font>

204
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:37,753
<font color="yellow">Thanks, dad.</font>

205
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:42,819
<font color="yellow">And you can never tell this to grandfather.</font>

206
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:44,941
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

207
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:48,137
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get angry because
she said I was an imposter?</font>

208
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:54,844
<font color="yellow">Grandfather will get angry, too, and he
might kick grandmother out of the house.</font>

209
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:58,652
<font color="yellow">It's the middle of winter, so if she
gets kicked out now, she'll freeze to death.</font>

210
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:02,432
<font color="yellow">Do you want her to freeze to death?</font>

211
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,022
<font color="yellow">No. No.</font>

212
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:07,936
<font color="yellow">So you can never tell grandfather, okay?</font>

213
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:10,694
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

214
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,217
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

215
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:15,382
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

216
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:16,936
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

217
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:22,944
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad you're not an imposter.</font>

218
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,537
<font color="yellow">Mother, I have no idea what I should do!</font>

219
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:41,154
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I have no excuse.</font>

220
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:44,957
<font color="yellow">Look at this flyer!</font>

221
00:14:45,663 --> 00:14:47,134
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. This is...</font>

222
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,823
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong is trying to
find her dad, so what am I</font>

223
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,254
<font color="yellow">supposed to do when grandmother
is making such a mess?</font>

224
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:55,493
<font color="yellow">I asked you to make sure
nothing like this happens!</font>

225
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:58,670
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll be the only one
who will die if this gets exposed?</font>

226
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:01,920
<font color="yellow">I know we're all going to die.</font>

227
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:05,037
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure nothing
like this ever happens again.</font>

228
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:07,968
<font color="yellow">How? How are you going to do that?</font>

229
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,826
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

230
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:43,159
<font color="yellow">Mom, we need to-</font>

231
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:46,149
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

232
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,059
<font color="yellow">I'm going down to the country
where your Aunt Dae-bok lives.</font>

233
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,506
<font color="yellow">Is this because I told you to get out?</font>

234
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:55,116
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you upsetting me like this?</font>

235
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:57,157
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because
I don't want to see you!</font>

236
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:05,085
<font color="yellow">Let me just say one last word to you.</font>

237
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:08,376
<font color="yellow">You should beg for
forgiveness now when you can.</font>

238
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:13,207
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to stop this
if it gets any bigger.</font>

239
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:17,566
<font color="yellow">Mom, why do you keep being ridiculous?</font>

240
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,730
<font color="yellow">Fine. Fine.</font>

241
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,990

<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

244
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:37,459
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'll send you enough money,
so just wait a little bit, okay?</font>

245
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,718
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

246
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:07,712

00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,286
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang?</font>

250
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,927
<font color="yellow">The case of the missing boxes
at the distribution center.</font>

251
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:26,108
<font color="yellow">The case of the leaked information.</font>

252
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:29,871
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

253
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,810
<font color="yellow">Those two are definitely related.</font>

254
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:48,831
<font color="yellow">When we put an ad in the
newspaper, we got a lot</font>

255
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,330
<font color="yellow">of calls, so how come no one is calling now?</font>

256
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,768
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, it might cost
a lot of money to put an ad in</font>

00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,918
<font color="yellow">the newspaper,
but I think it would be much better.</font>

258
00:17:57,231 --> 00:18:00,767
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom. This is just
the beginning. Would they call already?</font>

259
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,808
<font color="yellow">If there is no response
after we spread out all the</font>

260
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,169
<font color="yellow">fliers we ordered, let's put
an ad in the newspaper then.</font>

261
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,057
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that.</font>

262
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,690
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

263
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:23,637
<font color="yellow">Pardon? You're calling because of the flyer?</font>

264
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:28,479
<font color="yellow">What? You know where Kim Dae-hoon is?</font>

265
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,869
<font color="yellow">Where is Kim Dae-hoon? Where is my husband?</font>

266
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:41,275
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you after I get my money.</font>

267
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,138
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you.
As long as I can find him,</font>

268
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,628
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you. How much do you want?</font>

269
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:53,035
<font color="yellow">How do we know if the person
you have is really my father?</font>

270
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,581
<font color="yellow">You're very suspicious.</font>

271
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,315
<font color="yellow">Kim Dae-hoon was born in 1951,
and he's from Pyeongyang.</font>

272
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:03,748
<font color="yellow">His son's name is Kim Yeong-cheol.</font>

00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,531
<font color="yellow">His daughter's name is Kim Seung-hee.</font>

00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:09,597
<font color="yellow">His wife's name is Joo Young-ae.
His mother's name is Kim Soon-ok.</font>

275
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,152
<font color="yellow">He got shot while trying
to escape, and he gave</font>

276
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:16,008
<font color="yellow">a ring with the character
"Cheon" on it to you.</font>

277
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:18,749
<font color="yellow">Need I say more?</font>

278
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:23,063
<font color="yellow">No, no. He's really my husband.</font>

279
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,283
<font color="yellow">Where is he right now?</font>

280
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:29,083
<font color="yellow">Please bring my father to us.
I'm begging you.</font>

281
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,971
<font color="yellow">Then prepare $20,000.</font>

282
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,969
<font color="yellow">$20,000?</font>

283
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:40,987
<font color="yellow">Yes. It took $20,000 to
bring him here from China.</font>

284
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:45,025
<font color="yellow">I need that money in order to
bring Kim Dae-hoon to you.</font>

285
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:51,528
<font color="yellow">But we don't have that
much money right now...</font>

286
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:56,452
<font color="yellow">You don't have money?</font>

287
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,746
<font color="yellow">- It's too bad then.
- No, wait!</font>

288
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:01,927
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

289
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:06,813
<font color="yellow">We'll give you the money.
We'll come up with the money somehow.</font>

290
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:12,886
<font color="yellow">So please take care
of my husband until then.</font>

291
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:16,300
<font color="yellow">When you have the money,
give me a call.</font>

292
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,339
<font color="yellow">How will we be able to come up
with $20,000 immediately?</font>

293
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,965
<font color="yellow">Mom, let's ask the owner
of the house if we can</font>

294
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,554
<font color="yellow">take some money out of
the security deposit.</font>

295
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,362
<font color="yellow">You want me to give you $20,000
from the security deposit?</font>

296
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:44,049
<font color="yellow">Yes, something urgent came up,
so we really need the money. Please.</font>

297
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:46,678
<font color="yellow">If I take out $20,000
from the security deposit</font>

298
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,453
<font color="yellow">of $30,000, then there's only $10,000 left.</font>

299
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:52,503
<font color="yellow">I can't let you live on a security deposit
of $10,000 with a monthly payment of $300.</font>

300
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:56,370
<font color="yellow">If it's really an emergency,
let's raise the monthly rate to $500 then.</font>

301
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,306
<font color="yellow">Then I'll give you $20,000.</font>

302
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,071
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

303
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:02,964
<font color="yellow">Let's raise it then.</font>

304
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:07,155
<font color="yellow">But if you can't pay the monthly rent,
it'll become troublesome for me.</font>

305
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,657
<font color="yellow">So give me a year's worth
of monthly rent in advance.</font>

306
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,006
<font color="yellow">Pardon? A year's worth?</font>

307
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:15,737
<font color="yellow">If you don't like that,
I can't give you the money then.</font>

308
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:19,145
<font color="yellow">It's common for people who
take the security deposit in advance to</font>

309
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,603
<font color="yellow">run away in the middle of the night
because they can't pay the rent.</font>

310
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:26,675
<font color="yellow">Yes, all right. We'll do that.</font>

311
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:30,049
<font color="yellow">Then I'll deposit the money
into your account right away.</font>

312
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:35,157
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.</font>

313
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:05,497
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

314
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:10,409
<font color="yellow">Hello. Your co-workers said
I'll be able to meet you here.</font>

315
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,387
<font color="yellow">There's no reason for us to meet anymore.</font>

316
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,636
<font color="yellow">I would like to ask you something.</font>

317
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:21,045
<font color="yellow">You know Kim Mi-poong is my wife, don't you?</font>

318
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:29,199
<font color="yellow">But this time, my wife was involved in a
case of leaked information and was fired.</font>

319
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:37,710
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking that the
case of the missing boxes you</font>

320
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:42,478
<font color="yellow">committed is connected to
this case of the leaked information.</font>

321
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,087
<font color="yellow">No matter how many times I think about this,</font>

322
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:47,876
<font color="yellow">I don't think you would plan such a thing.</font>

323
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:53,689
<font color="yellow">It seems like someone
ordered you to do this, but who?</font>

324
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:56,899
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

325
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,086
<font color="yellow">It's all over already. If you're going to
mention this again, don't come back here.</font>

326
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:07,212
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

327
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,758
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll go for today.</font>

328
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:13,557
<font color="yellow">I'll see you next time.</font>

329
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:41,670
<font color="yellow">Hello? I deposited the money
into your account. Where should I go?</font>

330
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,602
<font color="yellow">The first exit at Cheonggu Station
in front of the park?</font>

331
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:46,184
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

332
00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:48,593
<font color="yellow">Let's go. We're going
to meet him an hour later.</font>

333
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:51,431
<font color="yellow">An hour later?
Okay, let's hurry up and go!</font>

334
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:11,034
<font color="yellow">Your father used
to love my dumplings.</font>

335
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:16,030
<font color="yellow">He said they tasted
just like the dumplings his</font>

336
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:19,593
<font color="yellow">mother used to make
and never got sick of them.</font>

337
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:26,182
<font color="yellow">That's why I had thought of
your father a lot when I made dumplings.</font>

338
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:35,557
<font color="yellow">Today, we'll be able to eat
dumpling soup with your father.</font>

339
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:40,113
<font color="yellow">You're right. When I think
about how I'll be able to eat</font>

340
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:43,873
<font color="yellow">dinner with father later tonight,
I feel like I'm dreaming.</font>

341
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,487
<font color="yellow">Mom, this isn't a dream, right?</font>

342
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:49,042
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

343
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,799
<font color="yellow">But why isn't he coming?</font>

344
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,144
<font color="yellow">Ten minutes have already passed.</font>

345
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,870
<font color="yellow">Oh, mom!</font>

346
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:10,440
<font color="yellow">I think he's coming. That looks like father.</font>

347
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:12,531
<font color="yellow">Where? Where?</font>

348
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:18,964
<font color="yellow">That's not him.</font>

349
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,674
<font color="yellow">All the men who pass by
look like your father now.</font>

350
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:27,597
<font color="yellow">But why isn't he coming?</font>

351
00:25:28,104 --> 00:25:30,943
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead and call him.
- Okay.</font>

352
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:43,855
<font color="yellow">- Your call cannot be completed at this time.
- Why? He's not answering?</font>

353
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,578
<font color="yellow">No, I think he's on his way.</font>

354
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,542
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's wait.</font>

355
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:50,831
<font color="yellow">He'll be here.</font>

356
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,353
<font color="yellow">They fell into the trap?</font>

357
00:25:57,675 --> 00:26:00,542
<font color="yellow">Good job. I'll send you your payment later.</font>

358
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,365
<font color="yellow">They fell for it?</font>

359
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:04,855
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

360
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,757
<font color="yellow">How did they fall so easily?</font>

361
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,222
<font color="yellow">That's amazing!</font>

362
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:12,859
<font color="yellow">Because they used their
security deposit, they'll</font>

363
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:15,628
<font color="yellow">never be able to refuse
my offer to go to America.</font>

364
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,745
<font color="yellow">That's great!</font>

365
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:23,154
<font color="yellow">But, despite their loss, what if
they still refuse to go to America?</font>

366
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:25,227
<font color="yellow">They wont' be able to last long.
We just have to</font>

367
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,105
<font color="yellow">make sure they don't
meet him in the meantime.</font>

368
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:32,099
<font color="yellow">So mother, even though I'm not around,
make sure you check if grandfather's son's</font>

369
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:36,094
<font color="yellow">memory is coming back or not. Also check
if he says or does anything strange.</font>

370
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:39,448
<font color="yellow">All right. Don't worry.</font>

371
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:42,714
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

372
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,402
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

373
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,113
<font color="yellow">Use this to get an
apartment for grandmother.</font>

374
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,253
<font color="yellow">It's going to be hard for
her to live in the country.</font>

375
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,268
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, thank you.</font>

376
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:57,714
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

377
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:13,964
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'll stay here, so go home.</font>

378
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,393
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay.</font>

379
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:21,260
<font color="yellow">But what happened? Why isn't he here yet?
He's not answering his phone either.</font>

380
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:25,698
<font color="yellow">What if something happened on the way here?</font>

381
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:28,942
<font color="yellow">What if they got into a car accident?</font>

382
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:31,091
<font color="yellow">I'll call him one more time.</font>

383
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,130
<font color="yellow">- The number you have dialed does not exist...
- What's wrong with the phone?</font>

384
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,675
<font color="yellow">Why? What's wrong?</font>

385
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,287
<font color="yellow">The number you have
dialed does not exist...</font>

386
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:55,054

Did it say this earlier, too?</font>

387
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:57,415
<font color="yellow">Why can't I reach him?</font>

388
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,177
<font color="yellow">No, it wasn't like that earlier.</font>

389
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:00,961
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

390
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,974
<font color="yellow">- The number you have dialed does
not exist, so please check again.
- Mom...</font>

391
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:09,983
<font color="yellow">what do we do?</font>

392
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:17,529
<font color="yellow">Did we just get conned?</font>

393
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,029

pick him up right away.</font>

<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

398

- I'll stay here, so hurry up and go.</font>

399
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,013
<font color="yellow">This can't be true. No.</font>

400
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:51,684
<font color="yellow">Mom, why did grandma
suddenly go to the country?</font>

401
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:53,607
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get to say bye to her.</font>

402
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:59,524
<font color="yellow">Well, your grand-aunt
was sick and summoned her.</font>

403
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,474
<font color="yellow">Then shouldn't we go, too?</font>

404
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,701
<font color="yellow">But it turned out that
she was faking her illness.</font>

405
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,069
<font color="yellow">She lied because
she wanted to see your grandma.</font>

406
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,552
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

407
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:14,301
<font color="yellow">She said she's going to stay there for
a while to keep your grand-aunt company.</font>

408
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:19,102
<font color="yellow">She said she was sorry
she couldn't leave without</font>

409
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:22,539
<font color="yellow">telling you good-bye
since she had to leave urgently.</font>

410
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:24,099
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

411
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,998
<font color="yellow">It's not like she's gone forever.
She'll come back.</font>

412
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:28,428
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

413
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,003
<font color="yellow">Did you give her enough bus fare?</font>

414
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:36,323
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. Don't worry.</font>

415
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,970
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

416
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:42,508
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for him, my mom wouldn't
have gotten kicked out of here!</font>

417
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:47,767
<font color="yellow">Gosh! That moron! That idiot!
Where the hell did he come from?</font>

418
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:54,266
<font color="yellow">Do you hate me?</font>

419
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:57,118
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

420
00:29:57,501 --> 00:30:00,318
<font color="yellow">No. Why would you suddenly ask me that?</font>

421
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:01,960
<font color="yellow">You just glared at me.</font>

422
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:04,267
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

423
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:08,001
<font color="yellow">I did? Oh, no, I didn't!</font>

424
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:11,048
<font color="yellow">I'm not stupid. You did glare at me.</font>

425
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:16,062
<font color="yellow">I think you saw something wrong.
I didn't glare at you.</font>

426
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:19,410
<font color="yellow">My eyes normally look like this!</font>

427
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:24,097
<font color="yellow">Even when I don't do anything,
people think I'm glaring at them!</font>

428
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:27,542
<font color="yellow">I really didn't glare at you!
I really didn't!</font>

429
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,081
<font color="yellow">Right, honey?</font>

00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:09,967
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'll stay here, so take
Yoo-sung and go home first.</font>

435
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:13,316
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

436
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:18,119
<font color="yellow">I'll stay, so go home with Yoo-sung.
He'll catch a cold at this rate.</font>

437
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:19,441
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

438
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,026
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

439
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,683
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

440
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,737
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, go to grandma.</font>

441
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,885
<font color="yellow">Oh, Yoo-sung.</font>

442
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:40,356
<font color="yellow">Mom, go.</font>

443
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:44,943
<font color="yellow">If you meet your father by
any chance, call me right away.</font>

444
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:47,392
<font color="yellow">I will. Hurry up and go.</font>

445
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:15,004
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's cold!</font>

446
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,677
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung!</font>

447
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:20,394
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung! Mother!</font>

448
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

449
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:31,363
<font color="yellow">Why isn't anyone home at this hour?</font>

450
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:40,514
<font color="yellow">Mother! Are you just coming home? I'm just
going to give you this pizza and go home.</font>

451
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:45,622
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

452
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:47,169
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

453
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:49,653
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

454
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:59,305
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-jin is good at this!
- Dae-hoon, do you love games so much?</font>

455
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,906
<font color="yellow">Father, don't talk to me.</font>

456
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,886
<font color="yellow">I won!</font>

457
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:11,962
<font color="yellow">- I lost.
- I won!</font>

458
00:33:11,987 --> 00:33:16,223
<font color="yellow">You're so amazing!
How can you be so good at this game?</font>

459
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,085
<font color="yellow">You're the best!</font>

460
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:21,125
<font color="yellow">You're better at this
than my friend Seung-yeon.</font>

461
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:24,090
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yoo-jin, do you want me
to get revenge for you?</font>

462
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,480
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Father, let's play.</font>

463
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:27,887
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

464
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,408
<font color="yellow">Start.</font>

465
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:35,629
<font color="yellow">- What's so great about games?
They're crazy over them.
- Go, Mr. Jo!</font>

466
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:41,731
<font color="yellow">Go, Mr. Jo!</font>

467
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:55,778
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong!</font>

468
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,364
<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

469
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,848
<font color="yellow">You're completely frozen.</font>

470
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:08,919
<font color="yellow">You're such a fool. How long were
you planning to stay out here?</font>

471
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:10,934
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

472
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,666
<font color="yellow">My dad isn't coming.</font>

473
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:24,439
<font color="yellow">My dad isn't coming.</font>

474
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:32,220
<font color="yellow"><i>The season silently leaves</i></font>

475
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:39,494
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm silently crying</i></font>

476
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:46,234
<font color="yellow"><i>I miss you, I miss you so much</i></font>

477
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:56,511
<font color="yellow"><i>The one person who crashes into the empty air</i></font>

478
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:04,887
<font color="yellow">My goodness. How could that happen?</font>

479
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:09,879
<font color="yellow">Isn't there a way to
catch that horrible jerk?</font>

480
00:35:11,098 --> 00:35:13,963
<font color="yellow">I'm trying my best,
but I think it's going to be difficult.</font>

481
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,647
<font color="yellow">It's impossible to locate him
because his phone is fake.</font>

482
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,332
<font color="yellow">My goodness.
He was resolved on conning them.</font>

483
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:26,632
<font color="yellow">It's like trying to
squeeze water from a stone.</font>

484
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,410
<font color="yellow">How could any human being
do such an awful thing?</font>

485
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:33,004
<font color="yellow">They suffered to come
all the way here from</font>

486
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:35,521
<font color="yellow">North Korea and managed
to barely get a room.</font>

487
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,410
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Now they wasted their money
trying to find her father.</font>

488
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,241
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. What will they do now?</font>

489
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,441
<font color="yellow">That vulgar bastard!</font>

490
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:50,344
<font color="yellow">Such terrible jerks will
be struck by lightning one day.</font>

491
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:51,739
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

492
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:55,079
<font color="yellow">But I'm worried about
Mi-poong and her mother.</font>

493
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:58,689
<font color="yellow">They lost their money in a fraud,
but since it was while trying</font>

494
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:01,224
<font color="yellow">to find her father,
they're even more heartbroken about it.</font>

495
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:03,090
<font color="yellow">Of course they would be.</font>

496
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:06,277
<font color="yellow">They lost their security deposit.</font>

497
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:13,168
<font color="yellow">I would feel much better if they
moved back into the back house.</font>

498
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:16,737
<font color="yellow">Mother, what are you saying?</font>

499
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:21,072
<font color="yellow">They already left, so why would
you want them to come back?</font>

500
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:23,754
<font color="yellow">Those people have nothing
to do with Jang-go now.</font>

501
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:29,819
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?
Were you eavesdropping on us?</font>

502
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:33,101
<font color="yellow">Of course I wasn't. I just happened
to hear the two of you talk.</font>

503
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:36,887
<font color="yellow">Those people are so hopeless.</font>

504
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:40,900
<font color="yellow">They lost their security deposit
trying to find her dead father?</font>

505
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,402
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- What?</font>

506
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:45,020
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, get a hold of yourself.</font>

507
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,110
<font color="yellow">You already divorced her,
so why would you see her?</font>

508
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,401
<font color="yellow">So what if she's looking
for someone or got</font>

509
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:52,272
<font color="yellow">conned? She has nothing
to do with you now!</font>

510
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,606
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

511
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,481
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong's father must be alive.</font>

512
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:11,098
<font color="yellow">I know. My grandfather
found his son, too.</font>

513
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:13,877
<font color="yellow">I hope she can find her father.</font>

514
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,553
<font color="yellow">It would be even better
if she found him, and</font>

515
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,613
<font color="yellow">he was rich like your grandfather! Right?</font>

516
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:20,434
<font color="yellow">That won't be easy.</font>

517
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:31,612
<font color="yellow">Mom, I bought medicine.</font>

518
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:35,327
<font color="yellow">Did Yoo-sung go to school?</font>

519
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,316
<font color="yellow">Yes. Take your medicine.</font>

520
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:51,238
<font color="yellow">How are we going to live now?</font>

521
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:56,300
<font color="yellow">If I think about losing
our precious security deposit...</font>

522
00:37:57,247 --> 00:37:58,647
<font color="yellow">I become so hopeless.</font>

523
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:03,331
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying
something so weak?</font>

524
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:07,145
<font color="yellow">We lived well under the
bridge with Yoo-sung before.</font>

525
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:10,598
<font color="yellow">At least we have a house now that
will shield us from the rain and snow.</font>

526
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,435
<font color="yellow">Compared to the past, aren't we rich?</font>

527
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:18,628
<font color="yellow">We need to leave here next year.
What will we do then?</font>

528
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:21,582
<font color="yellow">We'll think about it when
we come to that bridge.</font>

529
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:26,958
<font color="yellow">At least we have hope that father
is alive here somewhere in North Korea.</font>

530
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:31,888
<font color="yellow">So mom, you need to be healthy
so that we can find</font>

531
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:35,117
<font color="yellow">father and work hard
to make money for the rent.</font>

532
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,767
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

533
00:38:38,008 --> 00:38:40,141
<font color="yellow">Yes. I do</font>

534
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:42,672
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't worry.</font>

535
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:48,398
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get my head on straight
and live harder than before.</font>

536
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:50,648
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

537
00:38:53,438 --> 00:38:56,351
<font color="yellow">When you met him, was there anything
strange or suspicious about him?</font>

538
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:58,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

539
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:02,823
<font color="yellow">He just said that he called us
after he saw the flyer we put up.</font>

540
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:08,632
<font color="yellow">He said that he would bring my father to us
as long as we pay him for the broker fees.</font>

541
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:10,523
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

542
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:16,912
<font color="yellow">He even knew my mother-in-law's name, too.</font>

543
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,814
<font color="yellow">He also knew about what happened at
the Amnok River when we escaped here.</font>

544
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,744
<font color="yellow">If he hadn't heard it from my husband,
where would he have heard that from?</font>

545
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:31,415
<font color="yellow">I think they're doing this
to get more money from us.</font>

546
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:35,725
<font color="yellow">That's possible, but since
they used a fake phone, it seems</font>

547
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,185
<font color="yellow">as if they approached you
with the intent to con you.</font>

548
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:44,066
<font color="yellow">First of all, I think
it would be best if we find</font>

549
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,602
<font color="yellow">out if father is here
in South Korea or not.</font>

550
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:49,195
<font color="yellow">How do we find that out?
Is there a way?</font>

551
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,190
<font color="yellow">We need to go to
a non-governmental organization</font>

552
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:54,059
<font color="yellow">or center run by North Korean defectors.</font>

553
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:58,498
<font color="yellow">If father is really alive, then
he would have left his traces somewhere.</font>

554
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:03,555
<font color="yellow">So there was that method.
Why didn't I think of this before?</font>

555
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,937
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mi-poong, let's hurry up and go.</font>

556
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:08,895
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Let's go right now.</font>

557
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:18,916
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, for the past
two years, the Kim Dae-hoon you</font>

558
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:21,972
<font color="yellow">are searching for has never
visited our office before.</font>

559
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,097
<font color="yellow">I heard this was the most active center.</font>

560
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:29,820
<font color="yellow">Then was there anyone searching for
Kim Mi-poong, Kim Seung-hee, or Joo Young-ae?</font>

561
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,638
<font color="yellow">I searched through the forms,
but there isn't such a person here.</font>

562
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:39,516
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

563
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:44,463
<font color="yellow">Then isn't there
a program that helps the</font>

564
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:47,516
<font color="yellow">defectors search for
their family in South Korea?</font>

565
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:51,415
<font color="yellow">You can put up information,
such as name, age, and hometown,</font>

566
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,843
<font color="yellow">of the person you are searching for as
well as your phone number on our homepage.</font>

567
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:57,921
<font color="yellow">If you film a video searching for
your family, we can upload that also.</font>

568
00:40:58,516 --> 00:40:59,943
<font color="yellow">A video searching for their family?</font>

569
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:14,578
<font color="yellow">Honey...</font>

570
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:18,335
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon...</font>

571
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:25,398
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'll talk.</font>

572
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:37,539
<font color="yellow">Father, it's me, Seung-hee.</font>

573
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,937
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time, hasn't it?</font>

574
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:45,636
<font color="yellow">Here in South Korea,</font>

575
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:53,940
<font color="yellow">I'm living well as Kim Mi-poong,
the name you gave me.</font>

576
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,398
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong.</font>

577
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:04,562
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the name you gave me?</font>

578
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:08,656
<font color="yellow">All this time,</font>

579
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:12,089
<font color="yellow">we thought you were dead...</font>

580
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,302
<font color="yellow">so we didn't even think
about searching for you.</font>

581
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,559
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

582
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:22,410
<font color="yellow">mom and I...</font>

583
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:27,980
<font color="yellow">saw you here in South Korea.</font>

584
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:32,068
<font color="yellow">The person we saw is you, right?</font>

585
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,582
<font color="yellow">You're alive, aren't you?</font>

586
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:42,269
<font color="yellow">Father, we miss you so much.</font>

587
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:45,457
<font color="yellow">Dad...</font>

588
00:42:47,684 --> 00:42:49,017
<font color="yellow">let's meet for sure.</font>

589
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:35,988
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

590
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:38,753
<font color="yellow">You're late today.</font>

591
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,074
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

592
00:43:43,348 --> 00:43:46,699
<font color="yellow">But why are you suddenly wearing glasses?
Is there something wrong with your eye?</font>

593
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:52,857
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that. I just
can't make eye-contact with you.</font>

594
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:55,720
<font color="yellow">Why can't you make eye-contact with me?</font>

595
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,324
<font color="yellow">Is it because of what happened that night?</font>

596
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,288
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, have a seat.
Let's straighten what happened that night.</font>

597
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:08,371
<font color="yellow">Straighten?</font>

598
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,199
<font color="yellow">Straighten what?</font>

599
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:12,537
<font color="yellow">So that night was...</font>

600
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,173
<font color="yellow">So that night was...</font>

601
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:17,769
<font color="yellow">We were very drunk and...</font>

602
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:20,129
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

603
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,336
<font color="yellow">So are you trying to
say that you made a mistake</font>

604
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,147
<font color="yellow">that night because
you were very drunk?</font>

605
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:30,832
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel now.</font>

606
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:35,073
<font color="yellow">I'll be going home now. Bye.</font>

607
00:44:35,098 --> 00:44:38,692
<font color="yellow">When did I say it was a mistake?
I didn't even get to say anything yet!</font>

608
00:44:41,902 --> 00:44:42,902
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim...</font>

609
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:44,543
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi...</font>

610
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:49,304
<font color="yellow">Father, what are you doing?</font>

611
00:44:51,144 --> 00:44:52,929
<font color="yellow">Are you scolding Nam-yi?</font>

612
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:54,186
<font color="yellow">It's not like that!</font>

613
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:58,823
<font color="yellow">Then what is it? Father,
don't hurt Nam-yi's feelings anymore.</font>

614
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,410
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, don't call her Nam-yi anymore.</font>

615
00:45:03,293 --> 00:45:04,293
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

616
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,433
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi is my girlfriend.</font>

617
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,161
<font color="yellow">So you're forbidden to
call her Nam-yi from now on.</font>

618
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:13,354
<font color="yellow">Call her something else.</font>

619
00:45:13,871 --> 00:45:15,675
<font color="yellow">What? Girlfriend?</font>

620
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:45,855
<font color="yellow">Oh my god! What's wrong with the house?</font>

621
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:47,793
<font color="yellow">Kang Yoo-jin!</font>

622
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,349
<font color="yellow">Is this your house? If you keep doing this,
I'll send you back to the orphanage!</font>

623
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,207
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

624
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:59,645
<font color="yellow">Take these to the second floor
and play there! Hurry up! Go!</font>

625
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:02,184
<font color="yellow">How annoying!</font>

626
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,972
<font color="yellow">Look here, Ms. Ma.</font>

627
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,769
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did you call me?</font>

628
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,919
<font color="yellow">My father said
I'm the owner of this house.</font>

629
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:16,304
<font color="yellow">I'm the owner of this house,
so why are you the one who's yelling?</font>

630
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:18,598
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

631
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:25,174
<font color="yellow">The house is messy because Yoo-jin was
playing with me, so don't yell at her anymore.</font>

632
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:26,715
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

633
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:29,871
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

634
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:34,738
<font color="yellow">And apologize to Yoo-jin
for getting mad at her.</font>

635
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,915
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Yoo-jin.</font>

636
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:43,090
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, let's go play upstairs.</font>

637
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:44,441
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go.</font>

638
00:46:49,784 --> 00:46:54,051
<font color="yellow">He thinks he's the owner of
this house. What can I do about him?</font>

639
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:06,222
<font color="yellow">But Yoo-jin, why do you live here?</font>

640
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:08,569
<font color="yellow">Did your mom die, too?</font>

641
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:10,364
<font color="yellow">Do you not have a mom?</font>

642
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,183
<font color="yellow">No, my mom didn't die.</font>

643
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:14,543
<font color="yellow">I have a mom.</font>

644
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:15,738
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

645
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:18,652
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

646
00:47:19,097 --> 00:47:20,097
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

647
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:25,148
<font color="yellow">she's here in this house.</font>

648
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:26,668
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

649
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:28,699
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

650
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,910
<font color="yellow">Your mom is in this house?</font>

651
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:33,988
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

652
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:35,589
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

653
00:47:37,918 --> 00:47:41,032
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you if you
promise to keep this a secret.</font>

654
00:47:41,332 --> 00:47:43,158
<font color="yellow">I'll keep it. I promise.</font>

655
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:48,714
<font color="yellow">The truth is, Aunt Shin-ae is my mom.</font>

656
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:50,582
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

657
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,035
<font color="yellow">My Shin-ae?</font>

658
00:47:54,152 --> 00:47:55,152
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

659
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:57,012
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

660
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,449
<font color="yellow">But why do you call
her aunt instead of mom?</font>

661
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:07,886
<font color="yellow">There's an important reason, so she said
I have to call her aunt for three months.</font>

662
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:12,175
<font color="yellow">That way, I'll be able
to live here with her.</font>

663
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:17,707
<font color="yellow">So you can never tell this to anyone.</font>

664
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:23,535
<font color="yellow">I told you this because
you're my one and only true friend.</font>

665
00:48:24,629 --> 00:48:25,629
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

666
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:28,597
<font color="yellow">You must keep this a secret. Promise.</font>

667
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:30,434
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

668
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:49,795
<font color="yellow">Now that they lost their
security deposit, they'll be</font>

669
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,527
<font color="yellow">as desperate as a drowning man
who would catch a straw.</font>

670
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:56,252
<font color="yellow">Where will they be able to
find such a big straw as this one?</font>

671
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:10,293
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

672
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:23,902
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy!</font>

673
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:27,686
<font color="yellow">This is why I said I wouldn't
hire a newbie like you!</font>

674
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:30,331
<font color="yellow">But what did you say?
You said there was no problem!</font>

675
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:34,461
<font color="yellow">You were bragging how well you
could do the job! How is this doing well?</font>

676
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:36,633
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll quickly clean all this up.</font>

677
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:38,795
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem right now!</font>

678
00:49:39,098 --> 00:49:41,274
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about all this fish?</font>

679
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,175
<font color="yellow">They dropped onto the floor!
Who would buy these?</font>

680
00:49:45,363 --> 00:49:49,730
<font color="yellow">Sir, I'll pay for all the damage.
Just take it out of today's pay.</font>

681
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:51,347
<font color="yellow">God damn it!</font>

682
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:53,561
<font color="yellow">I'll never hire a woman again!</font>

683
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:27,832
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, did something happen?</font>

684
00:50:28,504 --> 00:50:30,562
<font color="yellow">You don't look very well.</font>

685
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:32,925
<font color="yellow">No, nothing happened.</font>

686
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:35,617
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened?</font>

687
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:41,510
<font color="yellow">She lost the security deposit in a fraud.
Is she trying not to ask me for anything?</font>

688
00:50:42,356 --> 00:50:47,333
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to be begging me for help.
Is this the time for you to be so prideful?</font>

689
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:50,027
<font color="yellow">But what brings you were again?</font>

690
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:55,537
<font color="yellow">No matter how many times I think of it,
this is an opportunity</font>

691
00:50:55,562 --> 00:50:58,627
<font color="yellow">that is too good to lose,
so I came to persuade you again.</font>

692
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:03,443
<font color="yellow">These are the photos of
America and the documents</font>

693
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:06,678
<font color="yellow">you'll need to go there that
I showed you last time.</font>

694
00:51:07,176 --> 00:51:10,293
<font color="yellow">Look at them again
and discuss it with Mi-poong.</font>

695
00:51:10,996 --> 00:51:13,589
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, thank you.</font>

696
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:18,035
<font color="yellow">However, Mi-poong will say no.</font>

697
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:20,668
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go right now either.</font>

698
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:22,543
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

699
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:26,321
<font color="yellow">Do you really think Mr. Kim is alive?</font>

700
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:31,096
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to America
because you're searching for him?</font>

701
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:34,151
<font color="yellow">I'm certain that he's alive.</font>

702
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:38,974
<font color="yellow">I met someone, and he knew
so much about my family.</font>

703
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:43,288
<font color="yellow">If my husband wasn't alive,
how would he have known all of that?</font>

704
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:49,329
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Did I fail because
I told the fake broker too much information?</font>

705
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:54,363
<font color="yellow">And right now, we're looking up
different ways to find him.</font>

706
00:51:55,175 --> 00:51:58,923
<font color="yellow">We even uploaded a video on the website
of a center that will help us find him.</font>

707
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:01,582
<font color="yellow">A video?</font>

708
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:09,410
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, you should go
to America for Yoo-sung's sake.</font>

709
00:52:10,356 --> 00:52:13,579
<font color="yellow">You can still search for
Mr. Kim when you're in America.</font>

710
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:18,157
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be in Korea. Nowadays,
you can find people through the internet.</font>

711
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:20,645
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

712
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:22,058
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

713
00:52:22,816 --> 00:52:26,452
<font color="yellow">If you go to America, Mi-poong will have
a high-paying job, and you'll have a house.</font>

714
00:52:26,832 --> 00:52:28,826
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you're suffering here.</font>

715
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:33,672
<font color="yellow">The benefits are so great that it would
be a waste to give to anyone else.</font>

716
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:49,339
<font color="yellow">We'll still decline.
Thank you for your kindness though.</font>

717
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,782
<font color="yellow">If we go to America
to live a comfortable life,</font>

718
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:56,886
<font color="yellow">do you really think
we'll feel comfortable?</font>

719
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:04,865
<font color="yellow">Thank you, but give
this opportunity to someone else.</font>

720
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,691
<font color="yellow">They lost their security deposit
and don't have any money now!</font>

721
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:22,741
<font color="yellow">I was going to give them a job,
house, and resettlement funds!</font>

722
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:25,254
<font color="yellow">Why the heck can't they go to America?</font>

723
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:28,667
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

724
00:53:29,316 --> 00:53:33,575
<font color="yellow">Let's see if you can resist
my temptation until the end.</font>

725
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:35,918
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

726
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:40,298
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim said we're going to watch
a cartoon film! Join us, mom!</font>

727
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:50,347
<font color="yellow">Kang Yoo-jin, who told you that you can
call me mom so loudly in the house?</font>

728
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,277
<font color="yellow">No one is on the second floor.</font>

729
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:54,313
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

730
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,339
<font color="yellow">From now on,
you must always call me aunt.</font>

731
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,269
<font color="yellow">Don't call me mom. Got it?</font>

732
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,520
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

733
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:05,271
<font color="yellow">You said I can call you mom
when it's just the two of us.</font>

734
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:09,123
<font color="yellow">If someone finds out about us,
we can't live together!</font>

735
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:11,864
<font color="yellow">Is it okay if you don't live with me? Huh?</font>

736
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,803
<font color="yellow">I'm still going to call you mom!
I don't want to call you aunt!</font>

737
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:17,967
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so disobedient?</font>

738
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:20,536
<font color="yellow">Are you going to upset me, too?</font>

739
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:21,809
<font color="yellow">I hate you!</font>

740
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:24,527
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin!</font>

741
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:27,574
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin!</font>

742
00:54:33,254 --> 00:54:36,183
<font color="yellow">Dad, what are you doing here?</font>

743
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:43,628
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, why won't you
let Yoo-jin call you mom?</font>

744
00:54:44,762 --> 00:54:45,762
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

745
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:49,856
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about, dad?</font>

746
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:52,582
<font color="yellow">Why would Yoo-jin call me mom?</font>

747
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:56,800
<font color="yellow">I know you're Yoo-jin's mom.</font>

748
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:59,084
<font color="yellow">She told me everything.</font>

749
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:00,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

750
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:07,746
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I promised Yoo-jin
I wouldn't tell anyone that you're her mom.</font>

751
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:11,339
<font color="yellow">So I won't tell father or anyone else.</font>

752
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,121
<font color="yellow">But if you made a promise,
why are you telling me?</font>

753
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:22,420
<font color="yellow">You're her mom, but she can't call
you that, so imagine how sad she would feel.</font>

754
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:26,480
<font color="yellow">It's not wrong to call your mom "mom."</font>

755
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:32,199
<font color="yellow">So don't scold her. This is my command.</font>

756
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:39,715
<font color="yellow">Then, as promised, I'll keep this
a secret for the next three months.</font>

757
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:43,652
<font color="yellow">Okay, dad.</font>

758
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:47,714
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I won't scold her,</font>

759
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:53,457
<font color="yellow">so go down and watch the movie with her.
I'll be down soon.</font>

760
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,519
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

761
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:57,654
<font color="yellow">What are you two talking about?</font>

762
00:55:58,496 --> 00:55:59,675
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

763
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,660
<font color="yellow">I'm even more curious
since he said it's a secret.</font>

764
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,308
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

765
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:09,105
<font color="yellow">He just wanted to watch
a cartoon movie together.</font>

766
00:56:09,354 --> 00:56:11,887
<font color="yellow">I'll quickly change and join you guys.</font>

767
00:56:23,137 --> 00:56:26,223
<font color="yellow">Come out, "Frozen!"</font>

768
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:31,116
<font color="yellow">- Which cartoon movie are you going to watch?
- "Frozen."</font>

769
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,371
<font color="yellow">Again? You already watched
that so many times!</font>

770
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:39,183
<font color="yellow">It's still fun, and Mr. Kim
hasn't watched it yet.</font>

771
00:56:40,895 --> 00:56:42,628
<font color="yellow">Okay, then "Frozen" it is.</font>

772
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:46,815
<font color="yellow">When you watch a movie, you need popcorn.</font>

773
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,427
<font color="yellow">Popcorn?</font>

774
00:56:50,465 --> 00:56:51,465
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

775
00:56:52,254 --> 00:56:56,269
<font color="yellow">Pop! Pop! It's puffed rice
made out of corn! It's delicious!</font>

776
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:57,699
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

777
00:56:58,645 --> 00:57:00,386
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, do we have popcorn at home?</font>

778
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:04,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, there's microwaveable popcorn.
Do you want me to make that for you?</font>

779
00:57:04,496 --> 00:57:07,760
<font color="yellow">- Yes, please give us juice, too.
- Okay.</font>

780
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:12,605
<font color="yellow">But can you really
make puffed rice at home?</font>

781
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:14,987
<font color="yellow">Yes. It quickly turns
into something like snow.</font>

782
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:18,160
<font color="yellow">Then I need to watch it happen!</font>

783
00:57:18,262 --> 00:57:21,067
<font color="yellow">We can even say, "Pop!" Let's go!</font>

784
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:31,510
<font color="yellow">It's so fascinating!</font>

785
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:37,414
<font color="yellow">The corn is really popping
and turning into snow!</font>

786
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:59,261
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Ms. Chun!</font>

787
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:02,714
<font color="yellow">- Father!
- Dad!</font>

788
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:03,739
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

789
00:58:04,152 --> 00:58:06,362
<font color="yellow">- Dad! Dad!
- Father!</font>

790
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,340
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

791
00:58:23,176 --> 00:58:24,475
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Kang Mi-jung?</font>

792
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,988
<font color="yellow">But why am I your father?</font>

793
00:58:31,348 --> 00:58:32,683
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

794
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:38,652
<font color="yellow">Father. Father!</font>

795
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:44,574
<font color="yellow">Father, are you okay? Father!</font>

796
00:58:46,543 --> 00:58:47,543
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

797
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,316
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon! Dae-hoon!</font>

798
00:59:01,902 --> 00:59:02,902
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

799
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:05,152
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

800
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:07,363
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

801
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:11,074
<font color="yellow">Do you recognize me?</font>

802
00:59:14,777 --> 00:59:17,347
<font color="yellow">I was watching the popcorn popping.</font>

803
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,595
<font color="yellow">Did I faint again?</font>

804
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:22,301
<font color="yellow">Popcorn?</font>

805
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:27,265
<font color="yellow">I think he was shocked
by the popping sound.</font>

806
00:59:27,676 --> 00:59:30,776
<font color="yellow">Don't ever pop popcorn again! Got that?</font>

807
00:59:32,066 --> 00:59:33,730
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes, sir.</font>

808
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:39,732
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, you really don't
remember fainting today?</font>

809
00:59:40,668 --> 00:59:41,668
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

810
00:59:42,902 --> 00:59:44,036
<font color="yellow">I don't remember.</font>

811
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,025
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, you were pretty shocked
because of your father, huh?</font>

812
00:59:56,621 --> 00:59:57,621
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

813
01:00:00,754 --> 01:00:03,339
<font color="yellow">But who is Kang Mi-jung?</font>

814
01:00:04,082 --> 01:00:05,082
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

815
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:07,027
<font color="yellow">Do you know her?</font>

816
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,628
<font color="yellow">No, I don't know who she is.</font>

817
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:14,742
<font color="yellow">But why did he call you Kang Mi-jung?</font>

818
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

819
01:00:16,777 --> 01:00:22,372
<font color="yellow">Maybe she's someone from his past.</font>

820
01:00:26,066 --> 01:00:28,399
<font color="yellow">Anyways, how frustrated will he be?</font>

821
01:00:29,316 --> 01:00:31,351
<font color="yellow">I hope his memory will return soon.</font>

822
01:00:33,652 --> 01:00:36,275
<font color="yellow">Yes. Me, too...</font>

823
01:00:40,863 --> 01:00:43,930
<font color="yellow">I think his memory
is returning bit by bit.</font>

824
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,699
<font color="yellow">Kang Mi-jung is your old name.</font>

825
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:49,167
<font color="yellow">How did he remember that name?</font>

826
01:00:51,098 --> 01:00:54,271
<font color="yellow">Just like my mom said,
are we going to get caught now?</font>

827
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:58,078
<font color="yellow">If we get caught,
that'll be the end of us.</font>

828
01:00:59,395 --> 01:01:05,106
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, should we turn ourselves in now?</font>

829
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:08,231
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

830
01:01:08,886 --> 01:01:12,209
<font color="yellow">We came too far to turn ourselves in now.</font>

831
01:01:12,856 --> 01:01:16,172
<font color="yellow">And if we turn ourselves in,
we'll be doomed!</font>

832
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:21,478
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, Dal-ho, and Hee-dong
will never see us again.</font>

833
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,485
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, what do we do now?</font>

834
01:01:27,368 --> 01:01:29,493
<font color="yellow">We just need to get rid of Mi-poong's father.</font>

835
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:32,220
<font color="yellow">Get rid of him?</font>

836
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:36,017
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

837
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:49,556
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin is going to school, and you'll
be home all by yourself. Will you be okay?</font>

838
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,220
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

839
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:54,813
<font color="yellow">I'll study and play games.
I'll be busy, too.</font>

840
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:55,838
<font color="yellow">Good!</font>

841
01:01:57,783 --> 01:02:01,885
<font color="yellow">Then I'll come pick you up
when I'm done with work.</font>

842
01:02:02,423 --> 01:02:05,648
<font color="yellow">I'll show you around my company today.</font>

843
01:02:05,978 --> 01:02:06,978
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

844
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:09,290
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

845
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:14,071
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, I'll see you
at the company later.</font>

846
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:15,096
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

847
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,595
<font color="yellow">Bye, Mr. Kim.</font>

848
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:27,498
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting my friends today,
so I should get ready and leave.</font>

849
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,861
<font color="yellow">Father, I need to talk to you.</font>

850
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,720
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

851
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:42,181
<font color="yellow">Today is my father's birthday?</font>

852
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:48,048
<font color="yellow">Yes, dad. So how about you and
I give him a surprise party?</font>

853
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:49,892
<font color="yellow">A surprise party?</font>

854
01:02:50,556 --> 01:02:53,156
<font color="yellow">No one will know, not even grandfather.</font>

855
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:56,700
<font color="yellow">We'll prepare a birthday party
and surprise him.</font>

856
01:02:57,447 --> 01:03:00,376
<font color="yellow">Wow! That sounds fun!</font>

857
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:05,644
<font color="yellow">- The housekeeper can't know
that we're planning a surprise party.
- Okay.</font>

858
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:07,877
<font color="yellow">I'll go out and wait for your first.</font>

859
01:03:08,713 --> 01:03:11,579
<font color="yellow">Dad, do you remember the building
where you ate ice cream last time?</font>

860
01:03:11,884 --> 01:03:13,056
<font color="yellow">Come to that building.</font>

861
01:03:13,736 --> 01:03:16,290
<font color="yellow">We can go to the mall and
buy things we'll need for the party.</font>

862
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

863
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,248
<font color="yellow">You need to come out secretly
so that the housekeeper can't see you.</font>

864
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,064
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

865
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:27,831
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

866
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:30,361
<font color="yellow">- Are you really going to tell my mom?
- Yes.</font>

867
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:33,307
<font color="yellow">- I'll make you bleed from both nostrils!
- Isn't this Chinese Quince Tea?</font>

868
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:36,472
<font color="yellow">You divorced him, and yet,
you take his money behind my back?</font>

869
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:39,176
<font color="yellow">- Kim Dae-hoon.
- Yes, that's me. Who are you?</font>

870
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:40,556
<font color="yellow">He didn't come there yet?</font>

871
01:04:40,581 --> 01:04:42,446
<font color="yellow">There's one person
who witnessed Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

872
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:45,789
<font color="yellow">- Did they catch him?
- Just stay still!</font>

873
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:48,440
<font color="yellow">Find him. Find him at once!</font>
