00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:07.538
Aunt!

3
00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:10.663
Speaking of the devil. He's here.

4
00:00:11.398 --> 00:00:12.598
You have a client.

5
00:00:13.377 --> 00:00:17.322
Hello. But what brings her here?

6
00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.852
She lost her entire security deposit!

7
00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:31.062
-(Lawyer Lee Jang-go) -Lawyer Lee Jang-go?

8
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.159
Jang-go?

9
00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:36.041
Jang-go?

10
00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:40.411
Tell Mr. Lee the exact details of your story.

11
00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.639
Please have a seat first.

12
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:49.197
Never mind. I'll be going now.

13
00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:50.838
Excuse me.

14
00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:54.223
What's wrong with her?

15
00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:58.244
Oh. It must be because of the legal fees.

16
00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:00.507
I'll go after her.

17
00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.159
Excuse me.

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440
Hold on.

19
00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:09.245
Yes?

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.750
If you're worried about the legal fees, you don't have to be.

21
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:15.956
No, it's not that.

22
00:01:16.737 --> 00:01:19.069
It seemed like you were in a troubling situation.

23
00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:22.290
Come inside and tell me the exact details.

24
00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.066
Forget it. I don't need your help.

25
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.354
(Episode 4)

26
00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:39.978
Why are you coming back alone?

27
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:41.198
Did that girl just leave?

28
00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.709
Yeah. She said she didn't need my help and just left.

29
00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:46.624
That's odd. She told me her family is out on the streets because

30
00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.071
she lost her security deposit. So why would she just leave?

31
00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:50.843
She sounded like she was from China.

32
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.056
She's not from China. She came from North Korea.

33
00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.536
She lost all her resettlement funds from the

34
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:57.750
country and the money she saved up all this time.

35
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.687
How dare they con such a poor girl.

36
00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:03.665
There are so many terrible people.

37
00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:07.060
But aunt, don't you feel like you saw her from somewhere?

38
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.110
She seems very familiar to me.

39
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.072
Come on. How would you know someone from North Korea?

40
00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:13.736
It's my first time meeting her.

41
00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:16.374
I guess.

42
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.335
(Lawyer Lee Jang-go)

43
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.523
I made a mistake.

44
00:02:39.608 --> 00:02:41.275
Jang-go wouldn't be here.

45
00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:46.577
Yes.

46
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:48.621
It's someone else.

47
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:53.239
Someone with the same name.

48
00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:20.467
Mr. Lee, please take a look at this document.

49
00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:22.561
Sure.

50
00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:25.390
-Oh, you're applying for this. -Yes.

51
00:03:38.523 --> 00:03:43.526
I didn't do anything. Your sister, that little tadpole, did this to me.

52
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:45.788
I almost died.

53
00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:48.158
Isn't he ugly?

54
00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:50.094
I'm dumbfounded.

55
00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.815
This is the first time someone told me that I'm ugly.

56
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
Let's go.

57
00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:57.126
We need to make sure Seung-hee goes home first.

58
00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.478
She'll go home on her own.

59
00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:01.711
She said her mom is going to pick her up.

60
00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:05.858
Still, how can we leave Seung-hee here alone?

61
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.891
Jang-go.

62
00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:14.105
You really are that fish boy.

63
00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:17.506
Jang-go, we'll definitely meet again!

64
00:04:17.693 --> 00:04:20.367
You heard that music in the music room yesterday, didn't you?

65
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.777
So you can never forget me!

66
00:04:24.203 --> 00:04:25.203
Got it?

67
00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.789
Seung-hee.

68
00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:36.938
-I think that's all you need to do. -Thank you.

69
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.953
Come inside and tell me the exact details.

70
00:05:16.978 --> 00:05:18.719
Forget it. I don't need your help.

71
00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:38.684
Hi, aunt. It's me.

72
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.848
Do you have the phone number or the house address of that girl from earlier?

73
00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:45.789
Oh, you don't?

74
00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.679
Okay.

75
00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.278
She was just on my mind.

76
00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:53.721
It's too bad then. Bye.

77
00:06:09.508 --> 00:06:10.508
Mom.

78
00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:12.689
Hi. I'm glad you came.

79
00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:13.927
I have something to tell you.

80
00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:16.153
Something to tell me?

81
00:06:16.178 --> 00:06:18.356
Jang-go, my friend you helped out last time

82
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.608
wants to buy you lunch tomorrow to thank you.

83
00:06:21.344 --> 00:06:23.163
It's fine. She doesn't have to do that.

84
00:06:23.187 --> 00:06:26.335
It's not fine! You helped her, so the least she can do is buy you lunch.

85
00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:29.898
Leave your lunchtime empty tomorrow. You can't make other plans.

86
00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:32.785
-All right. -Wash up. Dinner is almost ready.

87
00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:33.817
Okay.

88
00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:36.632
-Jang-go, you came home earlier than I did. -Yeah.

89
00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:43.047
Geum-sil, did you already find a matchmaker?

90
00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:47.367
No, I didn't. The truth is I'm going to let him meet my friend's daughter tomorrow.

91
00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:48.819
Your friend's daughter?

92
00:06:50.232 --> 00:06:51.507
What kind of family are they?

93
00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:58.906
Later on, my friend is going to inherit a hundred million dollars.

94
00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:00.798
A hundred million dollars?

95
00:07:02.023 --> 00:07:03.788
What kind of business do they own?

96
00:07:03.813 --> 00:07:08.031
They do real estate and own several lands, buildings, and shopping areas in Gangnam.

97
00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:10.287
They have a lot of properties.

98
00:07:10.312 --> 00:07:13.532
Indeed, a building in Gangnam is worth several million dollars.

99
00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.086
Oh my goodness! This is great!

100
00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:19.425
But Nam-yi, the distant relative of my friend who will

101
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.178
pass on his inheritance to her came from North Korea.

102
00:07:22.346 --> 00:07:26.265
However, he has no relatives in the North or South, except for my friend.

103
00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:31.102
So the cousin of that Elder, who is my friend's father-in-law, passed away.

104
00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:35.701
Can my friend, who is his distant relative, get the inheritance?

105
00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.956
Of course she can.

106
00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:39.815
Really?

107
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.151
They say you can make a big catch with three years

108
00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:44.441
of practice. I'm the office manager of a law firm.

109
00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:47.718
An inheritance by representation allows your friend to have the

110
00:07:47.743 --> 00:07:50.366
money that your friend's father-in-law was supposed to inherit.

111
00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:52.053
So it is true.

112
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.192
Oh my goodness.

113
00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:57.029
Geum-sil, I really hope this works out.

114
00:07:58.038 --> 00:08:01.444
But is your friend's daughter a good woman?

115
00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:05.404
I met her once, and she's very pretty and bright.

116
00:08:05.757 --> 00:08:07.170
She studied abroad, too!

117
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:10.306
Geum-sil, that's great!

118
00:08:10.928 --> 00:08:12.240
Don't tell Jang-go.

119
00:08:12.537 --> 00:08:14.230
If he finds out, he won't come.

120
00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:15.578
Okay, I got it!

121
00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:24.375
What were you two whispering about?

122
00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.461
Dinner is almost ready, mother.

123
00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:28.149
Mom, you don't have to know.

124
00:08:28.772 --> 00:08:30.131
What did you say? You little-

125
00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:35.399
At this rate, something really terrible will happen to Jang-soo.

126
00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:37.936
He really didn't even drink a drop of water today.

127
00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:40.107
He really didn't?

128
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:41.730
Yes!

129
00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:44.264
Maybe we should let him date Ms. Song.

130
00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:45.289
-Mom! -Mother!

131
00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:47.178
Are you out of your mind, too?

132
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:51.130
Love is a mental illness.

133
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.770
What can be solved when all we do is corner

134
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:56.865
him and yell at him when he's already sick?

135
00:08:58.694 --> 00:09:00.282
I'm so upset!

136
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:01.889
Gosh, that little punk!

137
00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:04.709
Hey, Lee Jang-soo.

138
00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:09.840
Lee Jang-soo, get up. We need to talk.

139
00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:16.169
Are you a little kid?

140
00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:19.287
If you're sure of your feelings, you should persuade the elders.

141
00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:21.343
Fasting won't solve anything.

142
00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.162
Lee Jang-soo!

143
00:09:27.193 --> 00:09:28.534
Come out and eat dinner.

144
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.738
Lee Jang-soo, aren't you going to get up?

145
00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:36.229
Jang-soo, hurry up and come eat.

146
00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:39.977
Your mom made your favorite braised pollack.

147
00:09:40.904 --> 00:09:44.850
Jang-soo, I heard you ate two chicken legs. So why are you pretending to starve?

148
00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:46.503
He didn't!

149
00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:48.257
I ate them!

150
00:09:48.513 --> 00:09:49.966
Jang-soo didn't eat them!

151
00:09:50.294 --> 00:09:54.028
Mom, how could you have ate them when he's the one who ate them?

152
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:59.087
That's how much you love Ms. Song.

153
00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:02.146
You ate chicken legs already, so why can't you eat braised pollack?

154
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.924
You already ate, so just come out and eat!

155
00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:14.222
Jang-soo! Oh my goodness! Jang-soo! Where are you going? Jang-soo!

156
00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:15.537
Where are you going, Jang-soo?

157
00:10:15.562 --> 00:10:17.353
He's totally gone mad.

158
00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:23.670
You can't even soothe him, so why did you hurt his pride?

159
00:10:23.842 --> 00:10:25.669
What? It's not like I said something wrong!

160
00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:28.644
You should've used any means to try and separate him from Ms. Song!

161
00:10:28.842 --> 00:10:32.974
What if he lives with Ms. Song out of anger? Will you take responsibility for that?

162
00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.441
Oh, no! Jang-soo
!

163
00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:38.340
This is too much. Mother!

164
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:40.607
-Mother! -Jang-soo!

165
00:10:40.632 --> 00:10:42.960
Dinner is all set up, but what are we doing?

166
00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:44.420
I'll get him!

167
00:10:57.287 --> 00:10:58.287
Joo-ri!

168
00:10:59.213 --> 00:11:01.162
(Inquiry for leasing)

169
00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:02.388
Joo-ri!

170
00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:14.345
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable.

171
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.889
Please call again or leave a message after the tone.

172
00:11:18.263 --> 00:11:19.263
Song Joo-ri!

173
00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:23.038
Where on earth did you go? Joo-ri!

174
00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:28.201
Jang-soo, you fool! Get a hold of yourself!

175
00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:30.912
Jang-soo, what's wrong with you?

176
00:11:31.271 --> 00:11:33.866
I was wrong, so let's go home, okay?

177
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:34.891
Let go!

178
00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:35.916
Oh, dear.

179
00:11:36.349 --> 00:11:39.516
Joo-ri disappeared because of you three!

180
00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:41.300
Is it a crime to be old?

181
00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.036
Is it a crime to be divorced?

182
00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:44.494
Is it a crime to have kids?

183
00:11:46.364 --> 00:11:49.639
If something happens to Joo-ri, I'll die, too!

184
00:11:50.207 --> 00:11:51.207
Just know that!

185
00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:53.528
-Oh my goodness! -Hey! Hey! Hey!

186
00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:55.883
Jang-soo! Mother!

187
00:11:55.908 --> 00:11:57.218
-Mother! -Mom!

188
00:11:57.243 --> 00:12:00.418
-I'll find Jang-soo, so go home first. -Okay.

189
00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:02.101
Mother, get a hold of yourself.

190
00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:06.255
-Mom! -Jang-soo!

191
00:12:08.567 --> 00:12:09.567
Oh my gosh.

192
00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:13.892
-Watch it! -Sorry!

193
00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:15.637
I'm sorry!

194
00:12:18.778 --> 00:12:19.778
Jang-go.

195
00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:21.176
What?

196
00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:22.348
Jang-go.

197
00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:23.739
What?

198
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:28.496
Do you know how pitiful Joo-ri is?

199
00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:30.178
Shut up and just walk.

200
00:12:31.239 --> 00:12:32.869
She's a very pitiful woman.

201
00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:37.597
I have to protect her!

202
00:12:38.786 --> 00:12:40.386
Okay, fine. Protect her.

203
00:12:42.403 --> 00:12:43.403
Jang-go.

204
00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:44.801
What?

205
00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:46.977
I miss Joo-ri.

206
00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:50.403
Jang-soo.

207
00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:52.005
Joo-ri!

208
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.794
Jang-soo!

209
00:13:17.747 --> 00:13:20.728
What's wrong? You can't sleep?

210
00:13:22.113 --> 00:13:24.765
No. I just...

211
00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:34.927
What's wrong? Did something happen when you

212
00:13:34.952 --> 00:13:38.540
went to the lawyer's office on the third floor?

213
00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:40.364
Of course not.

214
00:13:41.598 --> 00:13:43.051
Nothing happened.

215
00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:49.468
Did the lawyer say there's no way to get our money back?

216
00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:55.480
No. I went, but the lawyer wasn't there, so I came back.

217
00:13:58.262 --> 00:13:59.262
Mom.

218
00:14:00.528 --> 00:14:04.187
I trusted my friend's words, lost all our security

219
00:14:04.212 --> 00:14:07.942
deposit, and made you and Yoo-sung suffer like this.

220
00:14:09.676 --> 00:14:10.676
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:10.872 --> 00:14:12.762
You didn't do it on purpose.

222
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:19.059
Think of it as learning a lesson here in South Korea.

223
00:14:20.098 --> 00:14:26.184
As long as Yoo-sung, you, and I are healthy...

224
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:28.508
we'll be able to stand up again.

225
00:14:30.192 --> 00:14:33.529
I'm going to harden my heart, too.

226
00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:54.145
Eye gunk.

227
00:15:01.091 --> 00:15:02.091
Blow.

228
00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:03.309
There you go.

229
00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:05.904
There. You're done.

230
00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:09.758
Let me see. You're so cute, Yoo-sung!

231
00:15:10.348 --> 00:15:13.305
I'd rather be cool than cute.

232
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.330
All right.

233
00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:18.061
But who do you take after that you're so cool like this?

234
00:15:18.575 --> 00:15:21.584
I'm cool like daddy because I'm a man!

235
00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:23.606
Huh?

236
00:15:24.817 --> 00:15:25.817
That's right.

237
00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:29.664
Oh, my handsome and cool Yoo-sung.

238
00:15:37.872 --> 00:15:39.490
-Hello! -Hello.

239
00:15:39.653 --> 00:15:41.699
Yoo-sung, say hello.

240
00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:43.520
Hello.

241
00:15:44.153 --> 00:15:45.153
Hey.

242
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:50.020
It must be uncomfortable because there's no bathroom in the room.

243
00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:52.196
No, we're not uncomfortable at all.

244
00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:53.736
Thank you so much.

245
00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:57.317
This is a leasing building and not a place suitable for living.

246
00:15:57.426 --> 00:15:58.426
It's fine.

247
00:15:58.762 --> 00:16:01.057
This place is as comfortable as a palace for us.

248
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.075
I'm grateful that you think so.

249
00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.466
Oh, Mr. Jo.

250
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.778
-Hi. -Hello.

251
00:16:10.716 --> 00:16:13.771
Oh, you're the woman who came to my office yesterday, right?

252
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:17.369
Yoo-sung, we'll be late for school.

253
00:16:18.926 --> 00:16:19.926
Bye.

254
00:16:21.786 --> 00:16:24.808
Mr. Jo, do you know her?

255
00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:26.688
Not really.

256
00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.830
She lost her security deposit and had nowhere else

257
00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.195
to go, so I told her to use the empty storage room.

258
00:16:32.637 --> 00:16:33.637
Why?

259
00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:37.025
Nothing. I just think she came to my office because of that problem.

260
00:16:37.591 --> 00:16:39.230
But she just left.

261
00:16:39.255 --> 00:16:43.774
She looks so weak, and her child looks like he's only a kindergartner.

262
00:16:44.262 --> 00:16:46.482
I felt so bad for her after hearing her story.

263
00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.005
Goodness.

264
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.706
Yoo-sung, did you pack your pencil?

265
00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:05.200
Okay, let's get on.

266
00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:29.567
Hello.

267
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.796
What are you doing here?

268
00:17:36.762 --> 00:17:39.439
I heard the simple version of your situation from Mr. Jo.

269
00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:42.048
You came to my office yesterday, but you just left.

270
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.650
I thought I might be able to help you.

271
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:47.962
I told you that I don't need your help.

272
00:17:48.353 --> 00:17:49.353
I'm fine.

273
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.505
I heard that you're not fine at all.

274
00:17:54.814 --> 00:17:57.088
The house you planned to move in was put up for

275
00:17:57.113 --> 00:17:59.196
auction, so you're staying here temporarily.

276
00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:02.964
So are you saying you'll be able to get me back

277
00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:05.707
the security deposit that was conned from me?

278
00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:09.289
Yes, I'll get it back for you.

279
00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:14.083
I can't get all of it back, but there should be a way to get part of it back.

280
00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:16.868
There's a way to get my security deposit back?

281
00:18:17.853 --> 00:18:18.920
Are you serious?

282
00:18:19.744 --> 00:18:20.744
Yes.

283
00:18:25.331 --> 00:18:27.369
(Lease Contract)

284
00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:33.501
It looks possible.

285
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.481
According to the Housing Lease Protection Act, I

286
00:18:37.506 --> 00:18:39.392
think you'll be able to get a part of it back.

287
00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:41.226
There is such a law in South Korea?

288
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.165
You can't take it back later on.

289
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.946
Yes, there is such a law.

290
00:18:46.478 --> 00:18:48.986
I won't take it back later on, so don't worry.

291
00:18:50.478 --> 00:18:51.478
But...

292
00:18:52.392 --> 00:18:54.797
if I can't get back all of it, how much can I get back?

293
00:18:55.705 --> 00:18:58.380
It's a good thing you did a moving-in notification beforehand.

294
00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:00.655
It's also good that you got an extension.

295
00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:03.784
According to the law, if the security deposit is less than a hundred

296
00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.502
thousand dollars, you will be able to quality for right of payment.

297
00:19:06.527 --> 00:19:07.527
So...

298
00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:09.528
you'll be able to get about $34,000.

299
00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:11.719
$34,000?

300
00:19:12.994 --> 00:19:14.194
Thank you so much!

301
00:19:17.103 --> 00:19:21.135
But when will I be able to get that money?

302
00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:24.549
I'll update you as it progresses.

303
00:19:25.384 --> 00:19:29.235
Thank you, Mr. Lee. Thank you so much.

304
00:19:29.782 --> 00:19:30.782
See?

305
00:19:31.002 --> 00:19:33.525
It's able to be easily solved, so why did you run away?

306
00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:36.689
Were you worried we would ask for a lot of legal fees?

307
00:19:37.228 --> 00:19:39.073
It wasn't that.

308
00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:43.219
But how much is the legal fee?

309
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:47.181
This is something you naturally get according to the law, so you don't have to pay us.

310
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.089
But you're helping me get a lot of money back.

311
00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:52.283
No, it's really okay. You don't have to pay us.

312
00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.541
Aunt, give me the copy of her ID.

313
00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:55.877
Here you go.

314
00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:58.283
Her ID.

315
00:20:00.627 --> 00:20:01.759
Kim Mi-poong?

316
00:20:05.298 --> 00:20:06.298
Here you go.

317
00:20:10.892 --> 00:20:14.800
Thank you so much, Mr. Lee. I'm sorry for troubling you, Ms. Lee.

318
00:20:21.517 --> 00:20:23.603
That North Korean girl is actually kind of cute.

319
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.048
She speaks her mind.

320
00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:29.896
I'm glad that she's able to get some of her money back, but where

321
00:20:29.922 --> 00:20:32.502
will she be able to find a place to live with only $34,000?

322
00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:34.381
It's very pitiful.

323
00:20:49.822 --> 00:20:52.713
Should I tell him that I'm Seung-hee?

324
00:20:55.603 --> 00:20:58.602
No. He didn't even recognize me.

325
00:21:00.017 --> 00:21:05.475
He's just a good lawyer that I met in this country. That's all.

326
00:21:08.384 --> 00:21:09.384
Hello?

327
00:21:09.697 --> 00:21:13.260
Yes, sir, of course I can work.

328
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:18.062
Then tell me the color and sizes you need through a text message.

329
00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:22.121
Okay. I'll head over to the factory right now. Bye.

330
00:21:41.963 --> 00:21:42.963
Hi.

331
00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:46.353
I'm about to leave now. You didn't forget our lunch today, did you?

332
00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:50.197
Come on. How can I forget when I'm the one buying?

333
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.500
Your daughter is coming, too, right?

334
00:21:53.213 --> 00:21:54.676
Yes, she is.

335
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.689
She's out right now, but she'll come to the restaurant right away.

336
00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:00.517
Then I'll see you later.

337
00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.532
Why is she so interested in Hee-Ra?

338
00:22:13.838 --> 00:22:15.290
(Mr. Yang)

339
00:22:45.064 --> 00:22:46.064
What do I do?

340
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.228
This is so annoying!

341
00:23:25.994 --> 00:23:26.994
Hold on.

342
00:23:28.572 --> 00:23:29.705
What do you want?

343
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:32.659
You scratched that car just now, didn't you?

344
00:23:33.744 --> 00:23:34.744
What?

345
00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:36.631
You can't just leave after scratching someone

346
00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:38.517
else's car. You need to leave a memo at least.

347
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:40.409
The car owner will be angry.

348
00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:44.889
You're not even the car owner, so why are you meddling in someone else's business?

349
00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:47.485
I'm not meddling, but you shouldn't do this.

350
00:23:48.517 --> 00:23:49.517
Leave a memo.

351
00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:50.931
You're weird.

352
00:23:51.172 --> 00:23:52.251
Get out of my way.

353
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.897
I can't do that.

354
00:23:54.525 --> 00:23:55.652
Leave a memo before you go.

355
00:23:59.157 --> 00:24:01.427
Wow. Are you a gangster or what?

356
00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.990
If you keep bothering me, I'll report you as a stalker!

357
00:24:04.563 --> 00:24:06.418
It seems like you're kind of dim-witted.

358
00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:08.586
There are security cameras around, so you'll

359
00:24:08.611 --> 00:24:10.446
get caught right away once they check them.

360
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:12.929
So? Why does it matter to you if I get caught

361
00:24:12.954 --> 00:24:14.881
by the security camera and get taken to jail?

362
00:24:14.906 --> 00:24:16.078
I saw it.

363
00:24:16.516 --> 00:24:18.109
I saw it, so how can I just go?

364
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:19.321
Leave a memo.

365
00:24:28.883 --> 00:24:29.883
Thank you.

366
00:24:36.548 --> 00:24:38.674
Hold on. Let me check first.

367
00:24:41.344 --> 00:24:43.211
Wow, you're really annoying.

368
00:24:47.501 --> 00:24:48.501
There. Happy?

369
00:24:50.969 --> 00:24:53.665
Gosh, what a psycho.

370
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:55.141
So annoying!

371
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:57.445
Out of all places, why did mom ask me to come here?

372
00:24:57.687 --> 00:24:59.781
(Jo Hee-Ra)

373
00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:02.532
Hello?

374
00:25:03.344 --> 00:25:05.122
What? They won't make the settlement?

375
00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:10.743
Ma'am, don't cry.

376
00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:14.031
I'll be there soon. Bye.

377
00:25:23.557 --> 00:25:26.366
(Mr. Yang)

378
00:25:35.548 --> 00:25:37.615
Lady, answer your phone.

379
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.232
If you ignore my call one more time,

380
00:25:41.883 --> 00:25:43.352
you'll regret it.

381
00:25:43.524 --> 00:25:44.524
What do I do?

382
00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:52.235
Hello?

383
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.143
Do you think ignoring my calls will solve everything?

384
00:25:55.337 --> 00:25:56.337
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:57.423 --> 00:26:01.552
Just give me a few more days.

386
00:26:03.665 --> 00:26:07.296
Of course. I'm not someone who wouldn't pay back money I borrowed.

387
00:26:09.594 --> 00:26:11.282
Of course I must pay you back.

388
00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:15.820
Yes. Yes. Yes. Good-bye.

389
00:26:18.454 --> 00:26:19.454
Chung-ja.

390
00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:22.078
Did you borrow money from somewhere?

391
00:26:22.601 --> 00:26:24.508
What kind of call was that? Is something wrong?

392
00:26:24.915 --> 00:26:26.610
It's nothing.

393
00:26:27.438 --> 00:26:29.971
What would I need to borrow money for?

394
00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:34.888
I guess. You don't need to borrow money when money is all that you have.

395
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.656
But what about your daughter?

396
00:26:37.884 --> 00:26:40.811
Huh? Oh, yes. She's on her way here right now.

397
00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:43.274
Mom!

398
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:47.221
What's wrong, Hee-Ra? What happened?

399
00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:50.355
Just now, in the parking lot, some crazy psycho-

400
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.320
Oh, my. What do you mean a crazy psycho?

401
00:26:53.938 --> 00:26:55.151
Did he do something to you?

402
00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:56.494
It's not that.

403
00:26:57.547 --> 00:27:04.666
I was parking my car when I just slightly scratched the car next to mine.

404
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.655
My goodness.

405
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.460
It wasn't even his car, but he told me I had to leave a memo

406
00:27:10.194 --> 00:27:12.532
and blocked me to stop me from leaving!

407
00:27:12.557 --> 00:27:13.703
Oh, my!

408
00:27:14.184 --> 00:27:16.187
That's a strange man!

409
00:27:16.766 --> 00:27:17.790
Come with me.

410
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.469
I'll get him.

411
00:27:19.494 --> 00:27:20.494
Hey.

412
00:27:20.704 --> 00:27:23.422
You're supposed to avoid strange, crazy people like him.

413
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.305
What if something happens to you?

414
00:27:25.798 --> 00:27:26.969
Don't you watch the news?

415
00:27:28.087 --> 00:27:29.087
You're right.

416
00:27:30.813 --> 00:27:32.028
Nothing really happened?

417
00:27:32.782 --> 00:27:33.782
Yeah.

418
00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:37.488
From now on, if something like that happens, call my son.

419
00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:40.096
My son is a lawyer.

420
00:27:40.368 --> 00:27:41.410
He'll be here soon.

421
00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:43.232
I see.

422
00:27:45.589 --> 00:27:46.701
You should be careful.

423
00:27:48.097 --> 00:27:50.564
Hi, Jang-go. Why aren't you here yet?

424
00:27:53.019 --> 00:27:54.407
What is it?

425
00:27:56.776 --> 00:28:00.265
You should've stopped by at least. We prepared this meeting for you.

426
00:28:02.152 --> 00:28:04.536
Okay then. It's too bad.

427
00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:07.355
What do we do?

428
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.847
My son came here, but he has an urgent matter to attend, so he has to go.

429
00:28:13.511 --> 00:28:15.526
Really? That's too bad.

430
00:28:17.504 --> 00:28:20.628
I wanted to introduce my son to you, but I'll have to do that next time.

431
00:28:21.582 --> 00:28:25.145
Lawyers are usually like this, since they do very important things.

432
00:28:25.793 --> 00:28:26.793
Oh, I see.

433
00:28:28.425 --> 00:28:30.071
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

434
00:28:30.777 --> 00:28:31.777
Sure.

435
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:38.871
Your daughter is so beautiful.

436
00:28:41.285 --> 00:28:42.683
Does she have a boyfriend?

437
00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:44.943
What's wrong with her?

438
00:28:45.278 --> 00:28:47.920
She kept asking me to bring my daughter out. It was

439
00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:50.535
all because she wanted to hook her up with her son?

440
00:28:50.847 --> 00:28:53.463
How dare she.

441
00:28:54.457 --> 00:28:55.717
No, she doesn't.

442
00:28:57.198 --> 00:28:59.951
She's going on blind dates to get married.

443
00:29:01.191 --> 00:29:04.654
Tomorrow, she's going on a blind date with a congressman's son who's a dermatologist.

444
00:29:06.824 --> 00:29:08.075
She's going on a blind date?

445
00:29:09.027 --> 00:29:10.950
With a congressman's son?

446
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.800
Yes.

447
00:29:13.996 --> 00:29:15.396
What should we order?

448
00:29:59.379 --> 00:30:00.542
Geum-sil, what happened?

449
00:30:01.004 --> 00:30:02.468
Do they seem to like each other?

450
00:30:03.058 --> 00:30:04.525
They didn't even meet.

451
00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:06.105
Why not?

452
00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:08.323
I thought you said they were going to meet today.

453
00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:11.091
Something important came up for Jang-go, so he couldn't come out.

454
00:30:11.386 --> 00:30:14.478
What's more important than this? This is ridiculous.

455
00:30:14.863 --> 00:30:16.478
My friend's daughter won't do.

456
00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:18.183
She's going on a blind date.

457
00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:20.144
With a congressman's son who's a dermatologist.

458
00:30:20.332 --> 00:30:23.456
What? She's going on a blind date with a congressman's son?

459
00:30:24.011 --> 00:30:25.011
Yes.

460
00:30:26.464 --> 00:30:27.464
Geum-sil,

461
00:30:27.754 --> 00:30:30.534
just because there's a goalkeeper doesn't mean we can't make a goal.

462
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.964
It's just a blind date, so there's no goalkeeper anyways.

463
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.448
And all blind dates don't end up in marriage.

464
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.097
That's true.

465
00:30:37.582 --> 00:30:39.634
Geum-sil, are you just going to give up like this

466
00:30:39.658 --> 00:30:41.668
when she's the heir of a hundred million dollars?

467
00:30:42.004 --> 00:30:45.378
We couldn't even dream of a family like that unless it was your friend's daughter.

468
00:30:45.675 --> 00:30:48.959
There are plenty of lawyers around lately. We have nothing else to offer.

469
00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.722
The only thing is Jang-go's title as a lawyer.

470
00:30:52.504 --> 00:30:53.504
I guess.

471
00:30:54.004 --> 00:30:56.488
Geum-sil, we've got nothing to lose.

472
00:30:56.707 --> 00:30:59.081
Just be straightforward. "What do you think about my son?"

473
00:30:59.339 --> 00:31:01.245
Jang-go is handsome.

474
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.246
Your friend's daughter might like Jang-go better than that congressman's son.

475
00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:07.214
You're right.

476
00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:12.495
I can't watch Jang-go rot in this tiny office any longer.

477
00:31:13.207 --> 00:31:17.155
Geum-sil, let's come up with a good plan to get Jang-go married to that family.

478
00:31:19.089 --> 00:31:22.110
After hearing your words, I don't think it's time to give up yet.

479
00:31:23.074 --> 00:31:24.323
Of course not!

480
00:31:42.524 --> 00:31:45.301
(Kimchi cup ramen)

481
00:32:01.847 --> 00:32:03.464
Listen to me carefully.

482
00:32:04.441 --> 00:32:07.639
This is my mother's ring.

483
00:32:08.199 --> 00:32:11.151
When you go to South Korea, make sure you find my father.

484
00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:15.741
His name is Kim-

485
00:32:25.886 --> 00:32:29.468
Grandma. Grandma, what's wrong?

486
00:32:29.894 --> 00:32:30.894
Grandma.

487
00:32:32.386 --> 00:32:34.051
Grandma, what's wrong?

488
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:36.261
Grandma.

489
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:40.802
Yes. Yes, Yoo-sung.

490
00:32:43.683 --> 00:32:45.742
Grandma, someone is here.

491
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.050
Who can it be?

492
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.230
Who is it?

493
00:33:00.754 --> 00:33:01.754
Hello.

494
00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:03.949
Hello.

495
00:33:04.175 --> 00:33:05.775
How do you like it here?

496
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:07.910
Oh, dear.

497
00:33:10.714 --> 00:33:12.195
Come eat at our restaurant.

498
00:33:12.683 --> 00:33:14.339
No, it's all right.

499
00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:17.628
It's better for the child to eat something other than ramen.

500
00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:18.863
It's fine, so come on.

501
00:33:20.043 --> 00:33:21.043
It's fine.

502
00:33:21.675 --> 00:33:24.198
I'm grateful for your offer.

503
00:33:24.558 --> 00:33:26.054
Don't be like that, and come on.

504
00:33:26.648 --> 00:33:28.454
Mr. Kim who has let you stay in this place

505
00:33:28.479 --> 00:33:30.385
will be coming soon, so you can say hi to him.

506
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.758
Are you talking about the owner of this place?

507
00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:41.629
(Deokcheonok)

508
00:33:47.972 --> 00:33:50.918
Just leave it alone. My goodness.

509
00:33:55.254 --> 00:33:56.321
Just leave them.

510
00:33:57.112 --> 00:34:01.787
I wanted to pay back for the delicious noodles. I'm sorry. I'm very clumsy at this.

511
00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:03.396
It's not a problem.

512
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:05.684
I'm glad you thought they were delicious.

513
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:09.589
Hello.

514
00:34:12.574 --> 00:34:13.823
Hello.

515
00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:20.093
She's the person who Mr. Jung told us about.

516
00:34:20.527 --> 00:34:21.527
Oh, I see.

517
00:34:22.167 --> 00:34:24.682
I heard you suffered quite a bit.

518
00:34:25.152 --> 00:34:31.220
Still, if you want to live in this country, you must stay alert from now on.

519
00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:35.837
Yes. Thank you so much.

520
00:34:36.275 --> 00:34:38.392
I don't know how I can repay you for this.

521
00:34:39.517 --> 00:34:41.273
Where in North Korea did you come from?

522
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:43.294
I came from Pyeongyang.

523
00:34:43.947 --> 00:34:44.947
I see.

524
00:34:45.368 --> 00:34:46.790
Who did you come with?

525
00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:50.891
My daughter and my grandson.

526
00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:55.193
My daughter went to work.

527
00:34:56.414 --> 00:34:58.203
You don't have any other family members?

528
00:35:01.548 --> 00:35:03.072
Well...

529
00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:04.759
Oh, I see.

530
00:35:05.283 --> 00:35:07.359
It might be very uncomfortable,

531
00:35:07.923 --> 00:35:12.149
but please rest comfortably here until you find a place to go.

532
00:35:12.728 --> 00:35:15.624
Yes. Thank you very much.

533
00:35:17.142 --> 00:35:18.142
Grandma!

534
00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:21.697
You look very smart.

535
00:35:23.056 --> 00:35:25.462
I should give you some money.

536
00:35:28.337 --> 00:35:29.688
No, sir.

537
00:35:30.314 --> 00:35:31.314
It's fine.

538
00:35:32.915 --> 00:35:36.022
Eat a lot and grow up strong and healthy.

539
00:35:36.665 --> 00:35:37.665
Yes, sir.

540
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.463
Good boy.

541
00:35:42.376 --> 00:35:44.154
Say thank you.

542
00:35:45.572 --> 00:35:47.142
Thank you.

543
00:35:47.167 --> 00:35:48.167
You're welcome.

544
00:35:52.853 --> 00:35:53.853
Bye.

545
00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:13.329
Geez. She looks very gentle and calm.

546
00:36:14.236 --> 00:36:15.236
Goodness.

547
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:17.344
How did she end up that way?

548
00:36:17.804 --> 00:36:21.451
The lawyer on the third floor helped them get a part of their security deposit back.

549
00:36:21.782 --> 00:36:22.782
Really?

550
00:36:23.587 --> 00:36:25.226
He's a very nice fellow.

551
00:36:25.548 --> 00:36:30.954
According to Mr. Jung, while they were escaping, her son and husband died.

552
00:36:31.579 --> 00:36:32.579
Goodness.

553
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.542
What is going on?

554
00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:38.728
Geez.

555
00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:42.379
How much longer must this continue for?

556
00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:45.736
Goodness.

557
00:37:05.814 --> 00:37:07.549
Hello! Here are your samples.

558
00:37:08.282 --> 00:37:11.532
Hello, ma'am! Here are your samples! Bye!

559
00:37:12.353 --> 00:37:17.234
Hello, ma'am. These are the samples. Can you reform them?

560
00:37:17.259 --> 00:37:18.645
I'll do it nicely for you.

561
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:20.696
Thank you!

562
00:37:45.478 --> 00:37:48.666
Kim Mi-poong, what's wrong with you?

563
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.047
Thanks to Jang-go, you're able to get part of your security deposit back.

564
00:37:56.993 --> 00:38:02.539
And it's very fortunate that Jang-go doesn't recognize me when I'm in this state.

565
00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:05.633
Kim Mi-poong.

566
00:38:06.821 --> 00:38:08.047
Get a hold of yourself.

567
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.720
Cheer up.

568
00:38:10.415 --> 00:38:12.075
You need to protect mom and Yoo-sung.

569
00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:13.969
You can do it!

570
00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:51.643
It's been a while since I came to Macau, but I

571
00:38:51.668 --> 00:38:53.931
haven't been able to look around the city yet.

572
00:38:55.017 --> 00:38:58.677
We met like this, so can't you give me a tour of Macau?

573
00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:50.845
Mr. Lee,

574
00:39:51.376 --> 00:39:52.576
it's Kim Mi-poong.

575
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.112
Thank you so much for helping me.

576
00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.524
I don't know if you'll like this or not, but please enjoy.

577
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.470
Oh, my!

578
00:40:15.235 --> 00:40:16.821
Mi-poong, what are you doing here?

579
00:40:18.032 --> 00:40:19.032
Hello.

580
00:40:20.532 --> 00:40:21.799
Well, I was just...

581
00:40:29.431 --> 00:40:30.716
Did you bring those for me?

582
00:40:31.509 --> 00:40:34.024
Yes, well. The thing is...

583
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.111
I was so grateful.

584
00:40:37.196 --> 00:40:39.104
And you wouldn't accept any payment.

585
00:40:39.129 --> 00:40:41.329
But I was very sorry and grateful.

586
00:40:42.469 --> 00:40:46.323
I was slightly hungry anyways, so I bought some beer and snacks.

587
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:48.329
Hold on.

588
00:40:48.657 --> 00:40:50.286
Let's see.

589
00:40:54.901 --> 00:40:56.510
There are the fish cake skewers I like.

590
00:40:57.745 --> 00:40:58.745
Then enjoy.

591
00:41:00.136 --> 00:41:01.136
Mi-poong.

592
00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:03.538
Let's eat together.

593
00:41:03.864 --> 00:41:05.705
No, I'm fine!

594
00:41:06.057 --> 00:41:07.126
I'm full and-

595
00:41:07.956 --> 00:41:08.956
Oh, my.

596
00:41:11.088 --> 00:41:12.554
What's wrong with my stomach?

597
00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:15.274
It didn't make that sound because I'm hungry!

598
00:41:16.346 --> 00:41:18.125
Sometimes my stomach does that on its own.

599
00:41:18.954 --> 00:41:20.299
I'm really full.

600
00:41:20.862 --> 00:41:21.908
Oh, that's right.

601
00:41:22.151 --> 00:41:24.002
I forgot to tell you something important.

602
00:41:25.596 --> 00:41:26.929
Something important?

603
00:41:27.432 --> 00:41:28.720
Yes. Come inside.

604
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:30.651
Come in.

605
00:41:54.792 --> 00:41:58.228
Didn't you say you have something important to tell me?

606
00:41:58.878 --> 00:42:00.750
Eat first. I'll talk while we eat.

607
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.490
Now tell me.

608
00:42:17.904 --> 00:42:19.079
What is it?

609
00:42:20.943 --> 00:42:22.209
Is something wrong?

610
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.177
No. Nothing is wrong.

611
00:42:26.342 --> 00:42:29.099
I wanted you to eat with me. How can I eat all of this by myself?

612
00:42:30.193 --> 00:42:34.192
And it seemed like your stomach was trying to tell you it was hungry.

613
00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:39.019
It didn't make a sound because it was hungry! I'm serious!

614
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.920
I got it.

615
00:42:41.817 --> 00:42:44.166
I got it, so eat first.

616
00:42:45.826 --> 00:42:46.826
Eat up.

617
00:42:52.802 --> 00:42:54.766
Which part of North Korea did you come from?

618
00:42:56.615 --> 00:42:57.774
I came from Pyeongyang.

619
00:42:59.232 --> 00:43:00.232
Pyeongyang?

620
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.712
I know people from there.

621
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.876
By any chance, do you know Kim Yeong-cheol and Kim Seung-hee?

622
00:43:17.371 --> 00:43:18.371
Who?

623
00:43:18.823 --> 00:43:20.258
Kim Yeong-cheol and Kim Seung-hee.

624
00:43:20.535 --> 00:43:21.668
Do you know them?

625
00:43:23.386 --> 00:43:24.386
No, I don't.

626
00:43:25.871 --> 00:43:27.609
How would I know them?

627
00:43:28.335 --> 00:43:30.945
You're from Pyeongyang, so how can you not know them?

628
00:43:31.793 --> 00:43:34.573
Just because I'm from Pyeongyang doesn't mean I know everyone there.

629
00:43:34.598 --> 00:43:36.198
There are many people who live there.

630
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:38.777
But still, you're the same age as them.

631
00:43:40.027 --> 00:43:41.198
Do you really not know them?

632
00:43:41.223 --> 00:43:43.308
I said I don't know them. Why do you keep asking me?

633
00:43:43.738 --> 00:43:45.652
Do you know everyone who lives in Seoul?

634
00:43:47.847 --> 00:43:49.047
I'll be going now.

635
00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:50.519
Good-bye.

636
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.988
Did I ask her something I shouldn't have?

637
00:44:09.357 --> 00:44:10.756
He didn't forget about me.

638
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:13.708
He still remembers me.

639
00:44:23.388 --> 00:44:26.975
I'm sorry for lying to you.

640
00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:33.208
But...

641
00:44:35.778 --> 00:44:39.578
I don't want to show you this side of me.

642
00:44:42.974 --> 00:44:43.974
And now I'm not...

643
00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:47.856
the Kim Seung-hee you used to know.

644
00:45:08.818 --> 00:45:10.927
I said I don't know them. Why do you keep asking me?

645
00:45:11.176 --> 00:45:13.068
Do you know everyone who lives in Seoul?

646
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:16.661
Geez.

647
00:45:17.942 --> 00:45:21.819
Did she have to get so angry when all I asked her was if she knew those people?

648
00:45:29.896 --> 00:45:32.509
No. What am I thinking right now?

649
00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:35.731
Mi-poong can't be Seung-hee.

650
00:45:39.114 --> 00:45:40.447
I should just sleep.

651
00:46:05.036 --> 00:46:06.036
Yes.

652
00:46:06.966 --> 00:46:08.199
I have nothing to lose.

653
00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:11.619
Just because there's a goalkeeper doesn't mean I can't make a goal.

654
00:46:11.872 --> 00:46:14.805
I need to find out how Hee-ra's blind date went.

655
00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:30.070
Mom, take your medicine.

656
00:46:34.856 --> 00:46:39.137
I'm sorry for being sick in this situation.

657
00:46:39.591 --> 00:46:40.948
Mom, come on.

658
00:46:41.552 --> 00:46:43.231
How can you be sorry for having a cold?

659
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.528
Then everyone in the world would have to be sorry.

660
00:46:46.388 --> 00:46:47.536
Right, Yoo-sung?

661
00:46:47.841 --> 00:46:48.841
Yes!

662
00:46:49.982 --> 00:46:56.920
Still, I can take Yoo-sung to kindergarten, so you go on to work.

663
00:46:57.068 --> 00:46:58.372
I said I'll do it.

664
00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.466
You need to get better so that I can gain strength.

665
00:47:02.177 --> 00:47:04.465
Today, take your medicine and get plenty of rest.

666
00:47:04.732 --> 00:47:06.888
I bought porridge, too, so make sure you eat it.

667
00:47:07.318 --> 00:47:08.318
Okay, mom?

668
00:47:11.084 --> 00:47:12.084
Okay.

669
00:47:26.795 --> 00:47:28.443
I'm going to be late for kindergarten.

670
00:47:29.021 --> 00:47:31.810
You won't be late. The next bus will be here soon.

671
00:47:32.529 --> 00:47:33.796
What if it doesn't?

672
00:47:34.326 --> 00:47:37.295
Then should we have a bet to see if the bus comes soon or not?

673
00:47:38.006 --> 00:47:39.415
Loser gets a clout on the forehead.

674
00:47:42.028 --> 00:47:43.052
Mi-poong.

675
00:47:46.623 --> 00:47:47.623
Hello.

676
00:47:48.545 --> 00:47:49.786
Are you going somewhere?

677
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:51.075
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

678
00:47:51.732 --> 00:47:54.027
It's fine. The bus will take us there in no time.

679
00:47:54.334 --> 00:47:55.334
Thank you!

680
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.740
Kim Yoo-sung!

681
00:47:59.161 --> 00:48:02.830
If the bus doesn't come soon, I'll be late!

682
00:48:03.193 --> 00:48:04.518
Hurry up and get in, aunt!

683
00:48:07.555 --> 00:48:08.638
Hurry up and get in.

684
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:23.589
Put on your seat-belts. We'll be leaving now.

685
00:48:28.977 --> 00:48:32.570
Wow! Mister, your car is so nice!

686
00:48:34.508 --> 00:48:37.616
Aunt, I wish we had a car, too.

687
00:48:37.891 --> 00:48:42.314
Wait a little bit. When I make a lot of money, let's buy a car.

688
00:48:42.602 --> 00:48:43.602
Really?

689
00:48:43.969 --> 00:48:44.969
Of course!

690
00:48:44.994 --> 00:48:47.879
Then let's buy a red car.

691
00:48:48.946 --> 00:48:49.946
You got it.

692
00:48:50.477 --> 00:48:53.236
Instead, you need to eat all your food at school today.

693
00:48:53.555 --> 00:48:55.501
You can't leave leftovers like yesterday.

694
00:48:55.526 --> 00:48:57.494
Can't I leave just a little bit?

695
00:48:57.519 --> 00:48:59.209
I don't want to eat.

696
00:48:59.524 --> 00:49:02.911
If you don't eat, you'll turn into a dry fish!

697
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.578
What's that?

698
00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:16.118
Huh?

699
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:18.110
That's...

700
00:49:19.696 --> 00:49:22.953
A bony pollack.

701
00:49:24.922 --> 00:49:30.195
A pollack that you rip up into pieces and make into a soup.

702
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:33.465
Please stop the car.

703
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.060
We're almost here.

704
00:49:35.477 --> 00:49:37.532
Oh? We have to go a little further.

705
00:49:39.758 --> 00:49:41.787
Please stop the car. Hurry!

706
00:49:43.711 --> 00:49:45.359
Are you sure this is the right place?

707
00:49:45.508 --> 00:49:46.508
Yes.

708
00:49:47.805 --> 00:49:48.982
This is the right place.

709
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.136
We need to get off here.

710
00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:01.034
Thank you for the ride.

711
00:50:01.532 --> 00:50:02.799
Yoo-sung, let's go.

712
00:50:13.383 --> 00:50:15.663
That little tadpole is driving me nuts!

713
00:50:16.188 --> 00:50:18.989
If I'm a tadpole, you're a fish! A fish!

714
00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:20.756
What? A fish?

715
00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:23.586
Yes! A fish! A bony pollack!

716
00:50:23.836 --> 00:50:26.804
If you bully my brother again,

717
00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:30.029
I'll rip you up into pieces and make you into soup!

718
00:50:30.578 --> 00:50:31.586
Got it?

719
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.711
If you don't eat, you'll turn into a dry fish!

720
00:50:35.117 --> 00:50:38.186
By any chance, do you know Kim Yeong-cheol and Kim Seung-hee?

721
00:50:47.929 --> 00:50:50.813
(Kindergarten)

722
00:50:52.102 --> 00:50:54.806
-Bye, Yoo-sung! -Bye, aunt!

723
00:51:02.094 --> 00:51:03.094
Kim Seung-hee.

724
00:51:11.055 --> 00:51:14.178
What are you doing here?

725
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:25.315
You're Seung-hee, aren't you?

726
00:51:25.703 --> 00:51:26.703
Kim Seung-hee.

727
00:51:28.477 --> 00:51:31.476
What are you talking about?

728
00:51:32.704 --> 00:51:35.391
You're a very strange person.

729
00:51:36.133 --> 00:51:38.825
Is this how South Korean men flirt with women?

730
00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:40.922
You followed me all the way here.

731
00:51:41.915 --> 00:51:43.281
Are you a stalker?

732
00:51:44.446 --> 00:51:47.359
If you keep doing this, I'll look for another lawyer.

733
00:51:50.211 --> 00:51:51.211
I'm sorry.

734
00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:54.219
I'm sorry.

735
00:51:58.751 --> 00:52:01.804
I'm busy, so I'll leave first.

736
00:52:32.477 --> 00:52:33.477
What do I do?

737
00:52:33.502 --> 00:52:35.055
(Mr. Yang)

738
00:52:36.876 --> 00:52:38.344
Who can I borrow money from?

739
00:52:39.891 --> 00:52:40.891
Young-soon.

740
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:43.994
No. Her husband is really strict, so I won't

741
00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:45.805
even be able to get five hundred from her.

742
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:47.829
Hee-kyung.

743
00:52:48.992 --> 00:52:52.766
If I borrow money from her, rumors will start flying within a day.

744
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.109
Gosh. What do I do?

745
00:52:58.969 --> 00:53:01.079
Ms. Ma, please come out.

746
00:53:01.105 --> 00:53:04.988
-What is it? -Some men are kicking the gate and demanding for you to come out.

747
00:53:05.446 --> 00:53:07.012
What?

748
00:53:08.657 --> 00:53:10.928
Wow, Ms. Ma.

749
00:53:10.953 --> 00:53:13.958
You live in such a nice house, but you won't pay me back?

750
00:53:13.983 --> 00:53:16.799
I live in a semi-basement because of horrible

751
00:53:16.823 --> 00:53:19.516
people like you who won't pay my money back.

752
00:53:21.055 --> 00:53:24.115
-I'm trying to come up with the money- -Forget it.

753
00:53:24.313 --> 00:53:27.648
I have no choice but to get the money from your husband.

754
00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:32.532
Mr. Yang, I'll pay you back the money with interest this week. Okay?

755
00:53:32.906 --> 00:53:34.508
Really! I'm serious!

756
00:53:34.533 --> 00:53:37.113
-My husband can never know! -Let go of me!

757
00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.835
Oh my goodness!

758
00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.768
Oh my goodness! Chung-ja!

759
00:53:42.477 --> 00:53:43.477
Chung-ja!

760
00:53:43.907 --> 00:53:45.764
What are you doing to my friend?

761
00:53:46.008 --> 00:53:47.945
Chung-ja, what's going on?

762
00:53:47.969 --> 00:53:50.086
Who are those people?

763
00:53:50.111 --> 00:53:52.302
-What happened? -Geum-sil...

764
00:53:58.571 --> 00:53:59.969
Hold on.

765
00:54:01.796 --> 00:54:09.786
My husband, father, and kids can never know about what happened today.

766
00:54:11.163 --> 00:54:12.198
Do you understand?

767
00:54:12.552 --> 00:54:13.552
Yes.

768
00:54:18.678 --> 00:54:20.005
Are you okay now?

769
00:54:23.241 --> 00:54:24.704
Thank you so much, Geum-sil.

770
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.468
$30,000 must be a lot of money to you.

771
00:54:30.077 --> 00:54:31.670
Yet, you let me borrow it so suddenly.

772
00:54:32.241 --> 00:54:34.118
But what's going on?

773
00:54:34.842 --> 00:54:38.388
Why would you need to borrow money from such people?

774
00:54:39.288 --> 00:54:40.288
Geum-sil,

775
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:46.193
appearance can be deceptive.

776
00:54:46.569 --> 00:54:47.865
Appearance can be deceptive?

777
00:54:48.725 --> 00:54:50.206
What do you mean?

778
00:54:50.436 --> 00:54:53.350
So what if I inherit a hundred million dollars later on?

779
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.127
I have no cash right now.

780
00:54:56.874 --> 00:54:57.874
No cash.

781
00:54:58.217 --> 00:55:01.488
Elder must give you living expenses for maintaining the household.

782
00:55:01.796 --> 00:55:04.099
Yes, he does.

783
00:55:05.224 --> 00:55:07.779
But it's only $10,000. That's all.

784
00:55:08.663 --> 00:55:10.425
She gets $10,000 for living expenses?

785
00:55:10.768 --> 00:55:12.831
But that's not enough, so she's in debt?

786
00:55:13.838 --> 00:55:16.178
If I combine that with my husband's salary,

787
00:55:16.638 --> 00:55:20.240
I'll have about $15,000 in living expenses.

788
00:55:21.202 --> 00:55:24.616
What? A month's living expenses is $15,000?

789
00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:29.639
But I need to manage such a big house,

790
00:55:30.741 --> 00:55:33.674
and you even saw my mother causing trouble.

791
00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:37.371
I had to pay for Hee-ra's tuition to study abroad.

792
00:55:38.444 --> 00:55:43.030
$15,000 a month is nothing. I'm living in a bottomless pit.

793
00:55:43.624 --> 00:55:47.077
How can $15,000 a month not be enough?

794
00:55:47.632 --> 00:55:50.608
To be honest, these days, a thousand dollars is nothing.

795
00:55:51.397 --> 00:55:53.850
Is there anything to buy with a hundred dollars?

796
00:55:55.186 --> 00:55:57.350
Of course not. You can use that money up so

797
00:55:57.374 --> 00:55:59.635
fast that there will be a hole in your wallet.

798
00:55:59.818 --> 00:56:01.225
That's right!

799
00:56:01.513 --> 00:56:05.287
I'm paying this and that, which is how I ended up here.

800
00:56:07.967 --> 00:56:09.851
Who would understand my feelings?

801
00:56:11.576 --> 00:56:13.348
You're the one I can tell this to.

802
00:56:14.006 --> 00:56:15.606
So that's what happened.

803
00:56:16.537 --> 00:56:17.537
But Geum-sil...

804
00:56:19.615 --> 00:56:22.523
nobody else knows I live like this.

805
00:56:23.779 --> 00:56:25.996
-So... -All right. I got it.

806
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:27.803
I won't tell a soul.

807
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:33.177
Chung-ja, if you need to borrow money from now on, tell me.

808
00:56:34.287 --> 00:56:37.201
It would be better than borrowing small amounts of money here and there.

809
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:42.001
I won't be able to let you borrow too much, but I can help you out this much.

810
00:56:43.529 --> 00:56:47.306
Geum-sil, thank you for your kind words.

811
00:56:48.115 --> 00:56:49.803
You're the best!

812
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:55.475
Should I ask how her daughter's blind date with the congressman went?

813
00:56:57.123 --> 00:56:58.527
No, no, no.

814
00:56:58.552 --> 00:56:59.813
Now is not the right time.

815
00:57:03.339 --> 00:57:04.339
Hee-Ra!

816
00:57:06.511 --> 00:57:07.511
Hello.

817
00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.611
Hi. You're dressed so nicely. Did you go somewhere?

818
00:57:11.673 --> 00:57:13.974
How did it go? Did you decide to meet him again?

819
00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:16.792
Mom, I'm never going on a blind date again.

820
00:57:17.485 --> 00:57:20.611
You didn't reject him, did you?

821
00:57:21.087 --> 00:57:24.753
I did. I told him that I don't like him and that he should never contact me again.

822
00:57:26.166 --> 00:57:29.072
So what if he's a congressman's son? So what if he's a dermatologist?

823
00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:30.976
He's shorter than I am!

824
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:32.424
He has to be taller than be!

825
00:57:32.939 --> 00:57:34.585
And what about his face?

826
00:57:34.819 --> 00:57:37.131
The height and face are not important!

827
00:57:37.697 --> 00:57:38.885
He's a congressman's son!

828
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.065
He's a dermatologist!

829
00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.923
Height and face are important to me.

830
00:57:42.924 --> 00:57:44.236
Don't you think so, Ms. Hwang?

831
00:57:45.533 --> 00:57:49.127
That's right. If he doesn't have either, it would be difficult.

832
00:57:49.152 --> 00:57:50.300
Right?

833
00:57:50.566 --> 00:57:52.821
How can you kiss a guy who looks like that?

834
00:57:54.182 --> 00:57:57.447
Would you want to kiss or sleep with a guy who looks like fermented soybean?

835
00:57:59.689 --> 00:58:04.619
You can just close your eyes and kiss him! It's not such a big deal!

836
00:58:04.822 --> 00:58:07.506
If you like him so much, then you should just get married to him!

837
00:58:08.603 --> 00:58:09.908
What did you say?

838
00:58:47.509 --> 00:58:50.141
What is she so happy about?

839
00:58:55.978 --> 00:58:56.978
Grandma!

840
00:58:59.564 --> 00:59:00.955
Grandma, what are you doing here?

841
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.081
Hee-dong.

842
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:08.650
You want me to stay here?

843
00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:12.631
It'll be better than staying at a motel.

844
00:59:13.619 --> 00:59:18.987
You can watch TV with other people. There's food here, and you can wash, too.

845
00:59:19.916 --> 00:59:20.916
All right.

846
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.073
I'm not in the position to be picky right now.

847
00:59:24.978 --> 00:59:27.237
When the time is right, I'll talk to mom for you.

848
00:59:28.463 --> 00:59:31.600
If she's going to buy me a place to live, tell her

849
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:35.634
to get me an apartment in Gangnam. All right?

850
00:59:36.713 --> 00:59:37.876
All right.

851
00:59:49.244 --> 00:59:50.244
Hello?

852
00:59:52.525 --> 00:59:54.614
Oh, that house was successfully auctioned off?

853
00:59:56.236 --> 00:59:57.236
All right.

854
00:59:57.986 --> 00:59:58.986
Bye.

855
01:00:32.408 --> 01:00:36.088
Verbal abuse is another type of violence.

856
01:00:36.697 --> 01:00:37.697
Seung-hee!

857
01:00:41.385 --> 01:00:43.736
How dare a young boy like you you act indecently?

858
01:00:44.236 --> 01:00:45.711
You piece of trash!

859
01:00:56.275 --> 01:00:57.675
Yeong-cheol's mother?

860
01:01:01.455 --> 01:01:02.722
Seung-hee's mother?

861
01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.517
(Seoul Law Office)

862
01:02:04.768 --> 01:02:07.568
I won't leave until I hear the music!

863
01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:11.790
You're going to spend the night here because of that superstition?

864
01:02:17.635 --> 01:02:19.054
-It's a ghost! -It's a ghost!

865
01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:20.986
Hurry up!

866
01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:22.011
Open the door!

867
01:02:22.188 --> 01:02:25.435
Wasn't that really the melody of our fate?

868
01:02:45.302 --> 01:02:49.332
(Lawyer Lee Jang-go)

869
01:03:47.405 --> 01:03:48.712
You're Seung-hee, aren't you?

870
01:03:53.265 --> 01:03:54.651
That Kim Seung-hee I know?
