4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,621
<font color="yellow">Why? Is something...?</font>

<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

6
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:25,348
<font color="yellow">Do you recognize him? Look who's here!</font>

7
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:33,121
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, do you recognize your daughter?</font>

8
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:38,283

<font color="yellow">That woman...</font>

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,469
<font color="yellow">is my daughter?</font>

<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, she's your daughter!</font>

18
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,285
<font color="yellow">You should at least recognize your daughter!</font>

19
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:18,257
<font color="yellow">How can you not even recognize your own daughter?</font>

20
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:23,044
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm Seung-hee!</font>

21
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:29,395
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were alive!</font>

22
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,444
<font color="yellow">Why did you just come now when you were alive all this time?</font>

23
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,114
<font color="yellow">I thought you were dead!</font>

24
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:48,229
<font color="yellow">But what's wrong with my dad?</font>

25
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,281
<font color="yellow">Dad, what's wrong with you?</font>

26
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,204
<font color="yellow">Dad, look at me. Look at me, dad!</font>

27
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:00,197
<font color="yellow">While running away, he got shot, and because</font>

28
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,951
<font color="yellow">of that trauma, he can't remember anything.</font>

29
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:07,659

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,933
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I don't recognize you.</font>

31
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,611
<font color="yellow">But I really don't remember.</font>

32
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:24,997
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

33
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,377
<font color="yellow">It's okay, dad.</font>

34
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:31,366
<font color="yellow">I'm just grateful that you're alive.</font>

35
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,369
<font color="yellow">It's okay if you don't remember me.</font>

36
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:41,131
<font color="yellow">What kind of tragedy is this?</font>

37
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,239
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, don't worry.</font>

38
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,918
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever I can...</font>

39
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:54,285
<font color="yellow">to bring your father back to normal.</font>

40
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,697
<font color="yellow">Are you serious, dad?</font>

41
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,724
<font color="yellow">Grandfather found his son?</font>

42
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:08,996
<font color="yellow">He wasn't dead?</font>

43
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,396
<font color="yellow">We thought he was, but he was actually alive.</font>

44
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:16,048
<font color="yellow">We're going to have a celebratory dinner tonight, so bring Jang-soo</font>

45
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:18,475
<font color="yellow">over to introduce him to the family and celebrate with us.</font>

46
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:22,090
<font color="yellow">Can I bring Jang-soo with me?</font>

47
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:24,615
<font color="yellow">Of course. You must come together.</font>

48
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,211
<font color="yellow">Are you going to come without your husband?</font>

49
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,700
<font color="yellow">No! We'll come together! We'll come right now!</font>

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

51
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,106
<font color="yellow">Did something good happen?</font>

52
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:40,101
<font color="yellow">My grandfather found his long-lost son whom</font>

53
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:43,163
<font color="yellow">he thought was dead in sixty-something years!</font>

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,215
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious?</font>

55
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:47,801
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and change, so we can go to my house.</font>

56
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,845
<font color="yellow">- Where? - My house!</font>

57
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,322
<font color="yellow">What? Really?</font>

58
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:52,347
<font color="yellow">Yes! Hurry!</font>

59
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:57,330
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! What kind of joyful occasion is this?</font>

60
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:01,734
<font color="yellow">He met his son in sixty-something years! This is a miracle!</font>

61
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:05,121
<font color="yellow">Last time he found his granddaughter, and now he found his son.</font>

62
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,247
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim's wish came true.</font>

63
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,755
<font color="yellow">He had really wanted to find his family.</font>

64
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,985
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. What is more tragic than being separated</font>

65
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,764
<font color="yellow">from your family and not being able to meet them?</font>

66
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,848
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

67
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:21,168
<font color="yellow">So they invited you over for a party?</font>

68
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:24,559
<font color="yellow">Yes. My dad said that I must come with Jang-soo.</font>

69
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,996
<font color="yellow">Oh, then you must go!</font>

70
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:28,809
<font color="yellow">Tell them we said congratulations.</font>

71
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,371
<font color="yellow">- Okay. We'll be back. - Bye.</font>

72
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,582
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

73
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:39,003
<font color="yellow">Gosh. This is the first time Jang-soo is going</font>

74
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,964
<font color="yellow">to his in-laws' home after he got married.</font>

75
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,322
<font color="yellow">I think they're accepting Jang-soo as their son-in-law now.</font>

76
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:49,309
<font color="yellow">I feel so happy now, mother.</font>

77
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:56,069
<font color="yellow">How nice is it to see them walking out while holding hands together?</font>

78
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,567
<font color="yellow">I know!</font>

79
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:07,795
<font color="yellow">Poor Jang-go had to get a divorce because of his selfish mom.</font>

80
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:10,666
<font color="yellow">Would he even want to come home?</font>

81
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:15,642
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you making dinner? Are you trying to starve your mother-in-law?</font>

82
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:23,580
<font color="yellow">Let's keep it simple today. Make some dumplings.</font>

83
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,205
<font color="yellow">Eat it when it's warm.</font>

84
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:39,444
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious!</font>

85
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,241
<font color="yellow">Someone came.</font>

86
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:44,812
<font color="yellow">Who can it be?</font>

87
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,563
<font color="yellow">It's freezing cold! Oh, you were home! Hello, mother!</font>

88
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:57,874
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

89
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,899
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung!</font>

90
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:00,773
<font color="yellow">Hi, uncle.</font>

91
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,259
<font color="yellow">I love dumpling soup.</font>

92
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,733
<font color="yellow">Did you eat yet?</font>

93
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,844
<font color="yellow">No. Can you give me one bowl, please?</font>

94
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:12,226
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go. - Huh?</font>

95
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:13,694
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

96
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:15,481
<font color="yellow">That's right. This is yours.</font>

97
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,132
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

98
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,585
<font color="yellow">You left your scarf at home, so I brought it to you.</font>

99
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:22,444
<font color="yellow">You're grateful, aren't you?</font>

100
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:24,802
<font color="yellow">I'll accept this one, but if you see anymore</font>

101
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:26,725
<font color="yellow">of my belongings around, just throw them away.</font>

102
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:30,327
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why would you throw away good things?</font>

103
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:32,944
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't that be wrong, Yoo-sung?</font>

104
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,537
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't throw away good things, aunt.</font>

105
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,740
<font color="yellow">See? Even Yoo-sung says it's wrong.</font>

106
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,963
<font color="yellow">While you're here, hurry up and eat this while it's warm.</font>

107
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,184
<font color="yellow">I will! Thank you!</font>

108
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,641
<font color="yellow">Wow! The soup is amazing, mother!</font>

109
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:52,823
<font color="yellow">It's so hot and delicious!</font>

110
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,949
<font color="yellow">The soup is hot and delicious! I feel better already!</font>

111
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,750
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, after we eat, do you want to come</font>

112
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,859
<font color="yellow">to the supermarket with me to buy desserts?</font>

113
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:09,424
<font color="yellow">Yes, uncle!</font>

114
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,250
<font color="yellow">Okay! Let's eat!</font>

115
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food!</font>

116
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:14,836
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

117
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,375
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

118
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:24,808
<font color="yellow">- (Grocery Store) - Here, Yoo-sung. Eat this.</font>

119
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:31,649
<font color="yellow">I want to ask you for a favor.</font>

120
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,937
<font color="yellow">A favor? What is it?</font>

121
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,914
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, what I'm about to tell you right now...</font>

122
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,663
<font color="yellow">is between you and me. Man-to-man.</font>

123
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:44,463
<font color="yellow">So it's a secret, okay?</font>

124
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:47,833
<font color="yellow">Okay! I'm good at keeping secrets because I'm a man!</font>

125
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,077
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're so cute!</font>

126
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:51,969
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

127
00:07:54,828 --> 00:08:02,322
<font color="yellow">So, Yoo-sung, you know that your aunt and I are living separately right now, right?</font>

128
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:10,638
<font color="yellow">But I want to live with your aunt again because I love her so much.</font>

129
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,063
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Yoo-sung? Do you agree with me?</font>

130
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:17,171
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course I agree with you.</font>

131
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:20,837
<font color="yellow">You're so darn cute!</font>

132
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:28,088
<font color="yellow">Okay, Yoo-sung, that's why I would like your help.</font>

133
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:29,559
<font color="yellow">Can you help me?</font>

134
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:31,156
<font color="yellow">Sure!</font>

135
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:48,030
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, come and sit here for a moment.</font>

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,257
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is using all kinds of excuses to come and see you here.</font>

137
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,906
<font color="yellow">He can't seem to forget you.</font>

138
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:06,179
<font color="yellow">How about you change your mind, Mi-poong?</font>

139
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:08,031
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

140
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,228
<font color="yellow">If changing my mind was all it took to be happy with</font>

141
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,070
<font color="yellow">him, why would I have divorced him in the first place?</font>

142
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,890
<font color="yellow">I guess that's true, but I feel bad for the both of you.</font>

143
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,779
<font color="yellow">You two love each other, so why can't you live together?</font>

144
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,976
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

145
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:30,308
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, please reconsider one more time.</font>

146
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,886
<font color="yellow">If you two move out of his mother's house and live happily with your kids,</font>

147
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,603
<font color="yellow">wouldn't your mother-in-law be happy then?</font>

148
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,789
<font color="yellow">Mom, I don't want to be part of a family with people who don't accept us.</font>

149
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:48,270
<font color="yellow">And if I decide to get back together with Jang-go,</font>

150
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:51,466
<font color="yellow">his mother will really severe ties with him.</font>

151
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,488
<font color="yellow">I don't want Jang-go and his mother to turn out that way because of me.</font>

152
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:03,221
<font color="yellow">If someone told me to severe ties with you, I'll never be able to do that.</font>

153
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,406
<font color="yellow">So how could I tell Jang-go to do such a thing?</font>

154
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,421
<font color="yellow">Jang-go keeps on coming here. What will we do?</font>

155
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:15,413
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's go to America then.</font>

156
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:18,226
<font color="yellow">If we went far away, wouldn't you and Jang-go</font>

157
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:21,077
<font color="yellow">be able to forget each other more easily?</font>

158
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:25,687
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll think about it.</font>

159
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:33,429
<font color="yellow">It's cold. We're back.</font>

160
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:40,554
<font color="yellow">Uncle bought a bunch of ice cream and snacks for me.</font>

161
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:42,546
<font color="yellow">He did?</font>

162
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,233
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go. - Huh?</font>

163
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,715
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

164
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:47,859
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

165
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,296
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll be going now.</font>

166
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:55,039
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, man-to-man. You know, right?</font>

167
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

168
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:58,562
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

169
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:05,609
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

170
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:10,657
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, don't ever come back here again, and if</font>

171
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:13,483
<font color="yellow">you see my belongings, don't bring them to me.</font>

172
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,890
<font color="yellow">We're divorced, so don't come to my house ever again.</font>

173
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,133
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

174
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,041
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here to see you.</font>

175
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:27,312
<font color="yellow">I came to see Yoo-sung and your mother.</font>

176
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:30,762
<font color="yellow">I was curious if Yoo-sung was growing well and if your mother was doing well.</font>

177
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,213
<font color="yellow">I came to check on them.</font>

178
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:35,464
<font color="yellow">Why would you be concerned about my mom and Yoo-sung?</font>

179
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:36,917
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do that.</font>

180
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,661
<font color="yellow">Wow, look at you. The way you talk disappoints me.</font>

181
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:42,808
<font color="yellow">If not me, who else would take care of them?</font>

182
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,401
<font color="yellow">- If you're going to be ridiculous, just go back inside. It's cold. - Jang-go!</font>

183
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:49,452
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up, I'm really going to go far away!</font>

184
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:51,612
<font color="yellow">I'm going to disappear without you knowing!</font>

185
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,962
<font color="yellow">I definitely told you that you can't do that.</font>

186
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,691
<font color="yellow">If you were going to do this, why did we divorce?</font>

187
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,026
<font color="yellow">Do I need to remind you again?</font>

188
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,383
<font color="yellow">Because you wanted to.</font>

189
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:05,214
<font color="yellow">Because you said you were going to die. Because you can't die.</font>

190
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,543
<font color="yellow">That's why I let us get divorced.</font>

191
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:11,286
<font color="yellow">We're living separately right now, but nothing else has changed.</font>

192
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

193
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:15,561
<font color="yellow">You'll catch a cold. Go inside.</font>

194
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,202
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

195
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,003
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's wrong with him?</font>

196
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,096
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

197
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:48,284
<font color="yellow">"I'm pleased to meet you!"</font>

198
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,221
<font color="yellow">"I'm pleased to meet you!"</font>

199
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,186
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, grandfather!</font>

200
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,492
<font color="yellow">I'm so pleased to meet you!</font>

201
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:56,244
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

202
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,971
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, say something.</font>

203
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:06,011
<font color="yellow">Today is a very touching and happy day.</font>

204
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:13,108
<font color="yellow">Sixty-something years ago, I separated from my family and came here to South Korea.</font>

205
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:20,550
<font color="yellow">I lived all this time with the hope of meeting my family in North Korea.</font>

206
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:28,854
<font color="yellow">I miraculously met my granddaughter Shin-ae and my son Dae-hoon.</font>

207
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:38,057
<font color="yellow">On this day when my wish was granted, all of you gathered here to celebrate with me.</font>

208
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:42,281
<font color="yellow">Now I can die without regrets.</font>

209
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:46,232
<font color="yellow">And Dal-ho...</font>

210
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,144
<font color="yellow">thank you.</font>

211
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:53,489
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to you that I can be blessed at such a late age.</font>

212
00:13:54,573 --> 00:14:00,380
<font color="yellow">How would I have lived all this time without you?</font>

213
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,839
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim...</font>

214
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:08,194
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who suffered the most here! I cooked and did the laundry for him!</font>

215
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:11,237
<font color="yellow">How can he not even glance my way?</font>

216
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:16,279
<font color="yellow">My wife, Soon-ok, who is in heaven right now...</font>

217
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,651
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

218
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:23,792
<font color="yellow">How you must have suffered raising Dae-hoon all by yourself.</font>

219
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:29,143
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to leave first?</font>

220
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,002
<font color="yellow">Father, when are we going to eat?</font>

221
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:42,668
<font color="yellow">If you make a long speech in front of the dinner table, you'll be cursed at.</font>

222
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:49,777
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

223
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:57,664
<font color="yellow">Let's all be healthy and happy. Cheers!</font>

224
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,995
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers!</font>

225
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,182
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations! - Congratulations!</font>

226
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,657
<font color="yellow">I can't tell if Mr. Kim's son is an adult or a child.</font>

227
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:14,245
<font color="yellow">I'm confused whether I should speak to him formally or not.</font>

228
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,166
<font color="yellow">What kind of bolt out of the blue is this?</font>

229
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:18,713
<font color="yellow">It seems like he really doesn't remember, right?</font>

230
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:22,892
<font color="yellow">Yes, it seems like that for now, but when you watch dramas</font>

231
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,870
<font color="yellow">or movies, the character suddenly gets his memories back!</font>

232
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:28,162
<font color="yellow">Then what do we do?</font>

233
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,503
<font color="yellow">No way!</font>

234
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,456
<font color="yellow">Those are just dramas.</font>

235
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,831
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I hid the ring in the drawer.</font>

236
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,617
<font color="yellow">But whether he's a child or a man, he's a human being</font>

237
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:40,402
<font color="yellow">with legs, and he'll be walking around everywhere now.</font>

238
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:44,089
<font color="yellow">Then what if he bumps into Mi-poong or her mom? What will we do then?</font>

239
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,901
<font color="yellow">Then it'll be over for us!</font>

240
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,353
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong's family said they were going to America,</font>

241
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,102
<font color="yellow">so we just need to be careful until then.</font>

242
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,448
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

243
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:58,240
<font color="yellow">You scared us. You should've knocked!</font>

244
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,635
<font color="yellow">This is my room.</font>

245
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:06,647
<font color="yellow">Your conspiracy meetings won't work anymore.</font>

246
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:10,341
<font color="yellow">What do you mean conspiracy meetings? How could you say that?</font>

247
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:15,083
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that and just turn yourselves in.</font>

248
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:19,737
<font color="yellow">Would he kill you if you begged for forgiveness?</font>

249
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,119
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you talking about?</font>

250
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:25,617
<font color="yellow">What did we do wrong? Why do we have to turn ourselves in?</font>

251
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:31,400
<font color="yellow">It's only a matter of time before he finds out she's an imposter!</font>

252
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,979
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

253
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,343
<font color="yellow">Mother, do something about her!</font>

254
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:38,370
<font color="yellow">Okay...</font>

255
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,886
<font color="yellow">Look at that rude, little thing! You rude witch!</font>

256
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:45,466
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? My head hurts enough already!</font>

257
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:52,018
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, I ignored all this for your sake until now,</font>

258
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,878
<font color="yellow">but after seeing Mr. Kim being reunited with his son after sixty-something years,</font>

259
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:02,783
<font color="yellow">I can't just overlook this anymore.</font>

260
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,601
<font color="yellow">And if you can't just overlook this?</font>

261
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:08,159
<font color="yellow">Are you going to expose everything then?</font>

262
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,820
<font color="yellow">Aren't you scared of the heavens?</font>

263
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:14,642
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if you get punished for this?</font>

264
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,842
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm prepared to get punished!</font>

265
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,755
<font color="yellow">But I can't reveal the truth right now! Aside from</font>

266
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,105
<font color="yellow">everything else, what will happen if Dal-ho finds out?</font>

267
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,299
<font color="yellow">He'll want a divorce then!</font>

268
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,385
<font color="yellow">Then it's all over! I'm not the only one whose life</font>

269
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,346
<font color="yellow">will be for! It'll be over for Hee-dong as well!</font>

270
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,276
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see that happen?</font>

271
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:38,314
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want that. No! No!</font>

272
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,526
<font color="yellow">So please keep your mouth shut!</font>

273
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,560
<font color="yellow">So you live here on the second floor?</font>

274
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:51,464
<font color="yellow">Yes, dad.</font>

275
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:57,385
<font color="yellow">Wow. My father's house is very spacious and nice.</font>

276
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:01,072
<font color="yellow">My father must be very rich!</font>

277
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:04,324
<font color="yellow">He lives in such a nice house.</font>

278
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,636
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

279
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:12,995
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me?</font>

280
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:17,346
<font color="yellow">It's strange that I'm your dad.</font>

281
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:21,987
<font color="yellow">But am I really your dad?</font>

282
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,315
<font color="yellow">Yes, dad.</font>

283
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,432
<font color="yellow">Dad, you really can't remember anything?</font>

284
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,433
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

285
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,208
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Shin-ae.</font>

286
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,699
<font color="yellow">I don't remember.</font>

287
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
<font color="yellow">Nothing at all?</font>

288
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,159
<font color="yellow">Yes, nothing at all.</font>

289
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:47,037
<font color="yellow">Then you don't remember how we tried to escape by crossing the Amnok River?</font>

290
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:48,487
<font color="yellow">Amnok River?</font>

291
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,302
<font color="yellow">I've never been there before.</font>

292
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:56,228
<font color="yellow">You really don't remember going there?</font>

293
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,534
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

294
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:03,206
<font color="yellow">Then what do you remember about being in North Korea?</font>

295
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:08,941
<font color="yellow">My mother's face.</font>

296
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:15,056
<font color="yellow">Holding my mother's hand and walking along the Taedong River.</font>

297
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,987
<font color="yellow">The mung bean pancakes my mother used to make.</font>

298
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:24,260
<font color="yellow">And her bean-curd dregs rice.</font>

299
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,250
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:33,104
<font color="yellow">playing a game of slap-match with my comrades Min-soo, Jin-gook, and Dong-shik.</font>

301
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,018
<font color="yellow">Oh, do you know what Dong-shik's nickname is?</font>

302
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,089
<font color="yellow">It's "Dung Tub!"</font>

303
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,550
<font color="yellow">"Dung Tub!"</font>

304
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:48,941
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

305
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:52,165
<font color="yellow">are you really my daughter?</font>

306
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:58,206
<font color="yellow">I feel like you're not my daughter.</font>

307
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,089
<font color="yellow">No, dad!</font>

308
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,479
<font color="yellow">I am your daughter!</font>

309
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:06,101
<font color="yellow">You're lying, aren't you?</font>

310
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,524
<font color="yellow">You're lying right now, aren't you?</font>

311
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,838
<font color="yellow">No, dad!</font>

312
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:19,715
<font color="yellow">Just kidding!</font>

313
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:27,845
<font color="yellow">Why would you joke around like that?</font>

314
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,854
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I missed you? Did you not miss me at all?</font>

315
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,305
<font color="yellow">I have to remember you in order to miss you...</font>

316
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,516
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I can't remember you.</font>

317
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:50,990
<font color="yellow">Still, since we met like this, I'll be good to you from now on.</font>

318
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:54,834
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, I'm sorry.</font>

319
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:07,394
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

320
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,260
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you can't go home unless I come here?</font>

321
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:12,473
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think of it, I don't</font>

322
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,385
<font color="yellow">think what we had earlier was a company meal.</font>

323
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:15,589
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

324
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,963
<font color="yellow">just threaten me that you couldn't go home for that reason?</font>

325
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:24,341
<font color="yellow">Do you know how quickly I sped over here from Cheonan</font>

326
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,710
<font color="yellow">because I thought something terrible had happened?</font>

327
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,986
<font color="yellow">All I told you was that I couldn't go home. When did</font>

328
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,890
<font color="yellow">I threaten you that something terrible had happened?</font>

329
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:34,941
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

330
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:39,643
<font color="yellow">What do you mean when you say that our lunch wasn't a company meal?</font>

331
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,535
<font color="yellow">How was that a company meal?</font>

332
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:44,034
<font color="yellow">It was a food gathering for Won-bin's friends.</font>

333
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:48,816
<font color="yellow">I had to listen to Won-bin talk behind his teacher's back, his friends' school</font>

334
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,996
<font color="yellow">lives, and their worries. That was a counseling session, not a company meal.</font>

335
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:59,076
<font color="yellow">- Your point is? - A company meal has alcohol and grilled meat.</font>

336
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:02,872
<font color="yellow">We need to talk about how the store will develop in the</font>

337
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:06,016
<font color="yellow">future and exchange ideas about how to increase sales.</font>

338
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:10,906
<font color="yellow">It's a time when you can ask questions and get to know each other better.</font>

339
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:12,871
<font color="yellow">Fine!</font>

340
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,184
<font color="yellow">We'll do the darn company meal!</font>

341
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:17,261
<font color="yellow">- When should we do it? - Now.</font>

342
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:20,379
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Mr. Kim. - What?</font>

343
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,404
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

344
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:40,089
<font color="yellow">We already drank a lot. How about we stop drinking and go home now?</font>

345
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:41,941
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

346
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:45,536
<font color="yellow">How can we go when we haven't solved the difficult situation?</font>

347
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,120
<font color="yellow">I can't go home.</font>

348
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:48,636
<font color="yellow">Difficult situation?</font>

349
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,074
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

350
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:58,581
<font color="yellow">I never met a man who was as tactless and dim-witted as you are.</font>

351
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:00,175
<font color="yellow">I'm dim-witted?</font>

352
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:03,240
<font color="yellow">That's the first time I heard that one before.</font>

353
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,643
<font color="yellow">I'm a very exact person. You know that.</font>

354
00:23:07,277 --> 00:23:08,344
<font color="yellow">Look at you now.</font>

355
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:11,676
<font color="yellow">You don't even understand what I'm saying right now.</font>

356
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:14,254
<font color="yellow">What don't I understand?</font>

357
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,108
<font color="yellow">I sent you all these signals, but you don't see them.</font>

358
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,133
<font color="yellow">Just like now.</font>

359
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:21,890
<font color="yellow">This is our first company meal, but how can you only</font>

360
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,646
<font color="yellow">talk about medical appliances for the past two hours?</font>

361
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,664
<font color="yellow">How can you not know a woman's feelings?</font>

362
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,566
<font color="yellow">This was why I was going to quit.</font>

363
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:35,050
<font color="yellow">Because you're so dim-witted!</font>

364
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:39,863
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I said we should have a company dinner</font>

365
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,942
<font color="yellow">tonight in order to settle things once and for all.</font>

366
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,855
<font color="yellow">Settle things once and for all?</font>

367
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:46,996
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

368
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:52,245
<font color="yellow">No matter how many signals I send you, you don't realize anything, so...</font>

369
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,700
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you straightforwardly.</font>

370
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:00,615
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim...</font>

371
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,402
<font color="yellow">do you or do you not like me as a woman?</font>

372
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,466
<font color="yellow">Since you're not answering, I guess you don't.</font>

373
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:21,672
<font color="yellow">I got my answer now.</font>

374
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,712
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

375
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,349
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be going now.</font>

376
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:41,537
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

377
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:46,183
<font color="yellow">A man responds with actions rather than words.</font>

378
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:09,692
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

379
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:15,294
<font color="yellow">This is rice punch. It's cold, so it'll be refreshing to drink.</font>

380
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:17,037
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

381
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:22,705
<font color="yellow">It's great. Did you make it?</font>

382
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,294
<font color="yellow">No. Your mother made it.</font>

383
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:30,495
<font color="yellow">I'm giving her a hard time with the housework these days.</font>

384
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,509
<font color="yellow">Are you looking through those again?</font>

385
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:35,691
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything?</font>

386
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:37,279
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

387
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,003
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong's innocence should be revealed as soon as</font>

388
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:44,524
<font color="yellow">possible so that your mother can soften up a bit.</font>

389
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,202
<font color="yellow">Has Mi-poong changed her mind about the divorce?</font>

390
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,042
<font color="yellow">- No.- I understand. Your mother was so horrible to her.</font>

391
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,106
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong must have felt like dying after being fired</font>

392
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:00,259
<font color="yellow">for being blamed for something she didn't do.</font>

393
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh. She was treated as a thief.</font>

394
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,191
<font color="yellow">Her mother got on her knees in front of your mother while she was watching, too.</font>

395
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:11,259
<font color="yellow">If I was Mi-poong, I would never want to come back to this house either.</font>

396
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:19,149
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go, you still need to check on Mi-poong.</font>

397
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:22,516
<font color="yellow">I know. I went to her house today, too.</font>

398
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,531
<font color="yellow">Good. You did well.</font>

399
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:27,123
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

400
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,693
<font color="yellow">Out of sight, out of mind.</font>

401
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:34,742
<font color="yellow">Even though Mi-poong pushes you away, you just</font>

402
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,897
<font color="yellow">put on a thick face and go right for her.</font>

403
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:40,495
<font color="yellow">Then she'll come to you.</font>

404
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,146
<font color="yellow">Leave your mother to me.</font>

405
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:47,045
<font color="yellow">- Got that? - Yes. I'll trust you.</font>

406
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:52,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, do that. Everything will work out.</font>

407
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:41,224
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, if you're not sleeping, get up. I want to show you something.</font>

408
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,763
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon...</font>

409
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:50,310
<font color="yellow">have you seen this ring before?</font>

410
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:52,099
<font color="yellow">This is my mother's ring!</font>

411
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:58,168
<font color="yellow">My mother's ring has the word "Cheon" engraved on it.</font>

412
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,456
<font color="yellow">- But this one... - Yes. This has the word "Ok" on it.</font>

413
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,735
<font color="yellow">So you do remember this ring.</font>

414
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:08,636
<font color="yellow">This is the ring I wore on my finger.</font>

415
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:15,296
<font color="yellow">I heard you gave the ring with the word "Cheon" on it to Shin-ae.</font>

416
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:16,916
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

417
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,915
<font color="yellow">I gave it to Shin-ae?</font>

418
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,211
<font color="yellow">I don't remember that.</font>

419
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:28,290
<font color="yellow">Then where is mother's ring right now?</font>

420
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,391
<font color="yellow">Some fool lost it while she was cleaning my room.</font>

421
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,009
<font color="yellow">If I had that ring,</font>

422
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:43,884
<font color="yellow">it could have helped bring your memories back.</font>

423
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:49,266
<font color="yellow">Still, look at this ring frequently, think of</font>

424
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:53,580
<font color="yellow">your mother, and try to
regain your memories.</font>

425
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:56,704
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

426
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,220
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

427
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:03,704
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

428
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:05,634
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

429
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:08,142
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

430
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:10,937
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to call you.</font>

431
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:16,391
<font color="yellow">I really like the word "father."</font>

432
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:22,868
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was envious of my other comrades who had fathers.

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:34,431
<font color="yellow">Now that we met, call me as much as you want.</font>

435

00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,532
<font color="yellow">Why am I your dad?</font>

442
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,064
<font color="yellow">My Seung-hee!</font>

450
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,269
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - Hee-dong.</font>

451
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:45,822
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

452
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:48,446
<font color="yellow">- Oh my god! - Dae-hoon! Dae-hoon!</font>

453
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,512
<font color="yellow">- Shin-ae! - Grandfather.</font>

454
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,688
<font color="yellow">Dad is acting strange!</font>

455
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,337
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, what's wrong?</font>

456
00:31:58,736 --> 00:31:59,736
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

457
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,384
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's okay.</font>

458
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:06,517
<font color="yellow">- Father. - Yes. You're okay.</font>

459
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:09,666
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

460
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:22,724
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon. Dae-hoon, what's wrong? Did you have a frightening dream?</font>

461
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,400
<font color="yellow">Why are all of you out here?</font>

462
00:32:27,556 --> 00:32:28,889
<font color="yellow">Is it because of me?</font>

463
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:31,236
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon.</font>

464
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,547
<font color="yellow">Are you okay now?</font>

465
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:42,518
<font color="yellow">Dad, do you recognize me?</font>

466
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:44,611
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

467
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:46,982
<font color="yellow">You said you were my daughter.</font>

468
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:05,058
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much. He must have been shocked</font>

469
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,473
<font color="yellow">because his environment suddenly changed.</font>

470
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,676
<font color="yellow">It could be a good sign that his memory is coming back.</font>

471
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,970
<font color="yellow">I think it would be best for him to go to the hospital tomorrow.</font>

472
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:16,509
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

473
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:18,432
<font color="yellow">That would be best.</font>

474
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:21,596
<font color="yellow">- I'll make an appointment at the hospital tomorrow. - Okay.</font>

475
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:40,227
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

476
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:48,345
<font color="yellow">Sleep after you take this medicine. You'll be okay then.</font>

477
00:33:50,384 --> 00:33:51,384
<font color="yellow">- Go on. - Thank you.</font>

478
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:12,712
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, what if my dad continues to be like this?</font>

479
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:16,929
<font color="yellow">He didn't recognize me and said strange things.</font>

480
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,967
<font color="yellow">I was so scared.</font>

481
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:23,860
<font color="yellow">Like grandfather said, your father is a bit sick right now,</font>

482
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:27,360
<font color="yellow">so even if he says strange things, just forget about them.</font>

483
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:34,198
<font color="yellow">It worked out for the better.</font>

484
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,653
<font color="yellow">No matter what he says now, everyone will think he's just saying nonsense.</font>

485
00:34:58,802 --> 00:34:59,802
<font color="yellow">You wench!</font>

486
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:05,300
<font color="yellow">You didn't answer your phone all night long. Where did you spend the night?</font>

487
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:08,649
<font color="yellow">My battery went out, so I couldn't call you.</font>

488
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:11,773
<font color="yellow">Why did you wake up so early anyways?</font>

489
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,571
<font color="yellow">You seriously don't have any morning sleep.</font>

490
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:23,488
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me! - Be quiet, will you? Or else the rest of the family will come out!</font>

491
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:29,802
<font color="yellow">Did you make him sleep with you?</font>

492
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,045
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? All we did was just hold hands and sleep.</font>

493
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,983
<font color="yellow">What? All you did was just hold hands and sleep?</font>

494
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,752
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you think I was born yesterday?</font>

495
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,701
<font color="yellow">They say the one who wants to eat the fruit will climb the tree first.</font>

496
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
<font color="yellow">Good job!</font>

497
00:35:46,732 --> 00:35:50,420
<font color="yellow">- All we did was hold hands and sleep! - I got it!</font>

498
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:54,259
<font color="yellow">You did well! That was one good accident!</font>

499
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,170
<font color="yellow">There was no accident!</font>

500
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:58,904
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

501
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:04,116
<font color="yellow">After just holding hands with him while sleeping, do you think he's the one for you?</font>

502
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:05,756
<font color="yellow">I don't know!</font>

503
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,584
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, why are you throwing a tantrum?</font>

504
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:19,053
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung. Yoo-sung!</font>

505
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:24,467
<font color="yellow">Go to school today, and we'll go to the amusement park on Sunday. How about it?</font>

506
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:28,233
<font color="yellow">No! I'm going to go today! Today!</font>

507
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:34,492
<font color="yellow">You never threw a tantrum before. Yoo-sung, do</font>

508
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:37,813
<font color="yellow">you want to go to the amusement park that much?</font>

509
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:46,020
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm the only one in my school that never went to an amusement park before.</font>

510
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:50,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. Is that true?</font>

511
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,686
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay. I'm sorry.</font>

512
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,236
<font color="yellow">Okay, Yoo-sung. Don't cry.</font>

513
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:00,381
<font color="yellow">You must have wanted to go to the amusement park so</font>

514
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:02,981
<font color="yellow">much. You never threw a tantrum like this before.</font>

515
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:04,733
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

516
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:09,498
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, take Yoo-sung to the amusement park today.</font>

517
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:10,917
<font color="yellow">Come with us, mom.</font>

518
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:18,391
<font color="yellow">I want to, but what about all the kimbap and dumplings I made to sell today?</font>

519
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:21,344
<font color="yellow">The two of you should just go by yourselves today.</font>

520
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:24,530
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, brush your teeth and change your clothes.</font>

521
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,115
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the amusement park.</font>

522
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,467
<font color="yellow">Wow! I'm so excited!</font>

523
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:33,193
<font color="yellow">My goodness. He is a kid, after all.</font>

524
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:44,131
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's uncle's car!</font>

525
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:49,592
<font color="yellow">Oh, Kim Yoo-sung! Kim Mi-poong! You two must be going somewhere.</font>

526
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:51,697
<font color="yellow">This isn't the way to school.</font>

527
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,223
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business, and you go your way.</font>

528
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:58,145
<font color="yellow">We're going to the amusement park right now.</font>

529
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:00,474
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? The amusement park?</font>

530
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:04,321
<font color="yellow">Wow! I got the goosebumps! I was on my way to the amusement park right now!</font>

531
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:06,876
<font color="yellow">What? You're going to the amusement park?</font>

532
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,419
<font color="yellow">Oh, I must not have told you. I go to the amusement park sometimes.</font>

533
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:14,009
<font color="yellow">What a coincidence! Get in the car. I'll give you a ride.</font>

534
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:16,321
<font color="yellow">- Forget it. - Yes, uncle.</font>

535
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:17,868
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung!</font>

536
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,563
<font color="yellow">Aunt, we're going to be late. Hurry up and get in.</font>

537
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:26,348
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get in. Oh, it's cold! Cold! Cold!</font>

538
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:52,731
<font color="yellow">I examined the medical records of Kim Dae-hoon he brought from China.</font>

539
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,543
<font color="yellow">It seems like he had a severe gunshot injury.</font>

540
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:59,227
<font color="yellow">And he had three major surgeries as well.</font>

541
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:00,548
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

542
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:04,415
<font color="yellow">I heard he barely made it alive.</font>

543
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:10,212
<font color="yellow">That's why it is written down that his memory loss is due</font>

544
00:39:10,563 --> 00:39:14,878
<font color="yellow">to dissociative amnesia and stress from his gunshot injury.</font>

545
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:19,305
<font color="yellow">We, too, think his memory loss is from those reasons.</font>

546
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:23,134
<font color="yellow">He was trying to get rid of shock, pain, and</font>

547
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,207
<font color="yellow">fear at the time and lost his memory also.</font>

548
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:35,626
<font color="yellow">How painful must it have been for you to throw your memory away, too?</font>

549
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,663
<font color="yellow">Dr. Hong, will he be able to get better?</font>

550
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,211
<font color="yellow">If he can get recuperated,</font>

551
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,079
<font color="yellow">I'll do anything.</font>

552
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:53,493
<font color="yellow">As you know, the brain is rather mysterious and vast, so I can't guarantee anything.</font>

553
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:58,001
<font color="yellow">However, I know the causes, so I'll do my best, Mr. Kim.</font>

554
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,812
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll put my faith in you then.</font>

555
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:14,102
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon, you heard that if you come to the hospital on a regular basis</font>

556
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:19,454
<font color="yellow">and do as the doctor says, you'll be able to get your memory back, right?</font>

557
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,782
<font color="yellow">So let's get treatment, okay?</font>

558
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,557
<font color="yellow">Do you understand me?</font>

559
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:29,476
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand, father.</font>

560
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,897
<font color="yellow">But even if my memory doesn't come back, I'm okay.</font>

561
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:38,735
<font color="yellow">I'm happy just living like this with you.</font>

562
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,717
<font color="yellow">You're very optimistic, aren't you?</font>

563
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:45,153
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's think that way.</font>

564
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:53,336
<font color="yellow">Even if your memory doesn't return, Shin-ae, you, and I will live happily together.</font>

565
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,189
<font color="yellow">- Sounds good, right? - Yes.</font>

566
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:56,214
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

567
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:01,469
<font color="yellow">But where are we going right now?</font>

568
00:41:02,228 --> 00:41:04,047
<font color="yellow">Is there someplace you would like to go?</font>

569
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:08,649
<font color="yellow">Tell me whatever you want to do. I'll do everything for you.</font>

570
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:12,451
<font color="yellow">I heard amusement parks in South Korea are very nice.</font>

571
00:41:13,157 --> 00:41:15,219
<font color="yellow">I want to go there, father.</font>

572
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,617
<font color="yellow">- Amusement park? - Yes.</font>

573
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,450
<font color="yellow">Okay then. That's not hard at all. Let's go right now.</font>

574
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:26,656
<font color="yellow">- Right now? - Yes.</font>

575
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:27,868
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

576
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,087
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

577
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,336
<font color="yellow">That'll be three dollars.</font>

578
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:37,782
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

579
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:38,807
<font color="yellow">Lady!</font>

580
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:41,252
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you not to do business here?</font>

581
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:44,165
<font color="yellow">What a tick you are!</font>

582
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:47,979
<font color="yellow">There's an empty spot here, ma'am. We can do</font>

583
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:50,782
<font color="yellow">business here together. That will work out.</font>

584
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:53,532
<font color="yellow">You saw that, didn't you, honey? I told you she's like this.</font>

585
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:58,059
<font color="yellow">Hey, lady. How will this work out when you're doing business in someone else's spot?</font>

586
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:00,784
<font color="yellow">You're being very stubborn. Move this.</font>

587
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:03,474
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to food?</font>

588
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:06,324
<font color="yellow">- How dare you. - No! You can't do this!</font>

589
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:07,349
<font color="yellow">God damn it!</font>

590
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:12,214
<font color="yellow">- Why are you doing this? - Move!</font>

591
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,876
<font color="yellow">We're in the same situation!</font>

592
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:19,694
<font color="yellow">I didn't even move into your spot! All I did was set up a table in an empty spot!</font>

593
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,770
<font color="yellow">You little-</font>

594
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,770
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

595
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,641
<font color="yellow">I won't say much, so just leave.</font>

596
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,051
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo...</font>

597
00:42:30,645 --> 00:42:32,090
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

598
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:37,051
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

599
00:42:39,886 --> 00:42:42,074
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, honey. - Okay.</font>

600
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:06,488
<font color="yellow">I can do this by myself, so please go.</font>

601
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:10,542
<font color="yellow">I don't want to show this side of me to you.</font>

602
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:13,113
<font color="yellow">So please don't do this and just leave.</font>

603
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:39,518
<font color="yellow">- Yoo-sung, put your hands up! - Hands up!</font>

604
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,450
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

605
00:44:55,512 --> 00:44:59,131
<font color="yellow">I smell something fishy going on here.</font>

606
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,164
<font color="yellow">Smell? Smell what?</font>

607
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,285
<font color="yellow">I only smell something good from you.</font>

608
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:07,762
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

609
00:45:08,637 --> 00:45:12,410
<font color="yellow">You coaxed Yoo-sung into going to an amusement park first, didn't you?</font>

610
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:17,239
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why would I coax Yoo-sung and...?</font>

611
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:23,247
<font color="yellow">How'd you know?</font>

612
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,396
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't I be stupid not to know? Yoo-sung never throws tantrums, but he</font>

613
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:29,567
<font color="yellow">suddenly threw one to go the amusement park, so I knew something was off.</font>

614
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,206
<font color="yellow">How can you be so thoughtless?</font>

615
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,842
<font color="yellow">Would I have done this for no good reason?</font>

616
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:38,751
<font color="yellow">And I never pulled Yoo-sung into this mess. He was on my side all along.</font>

617
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:41,678
<font color="yellow">- How can you say that? - I'm sorry.</font>

618
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:44,448
<font color="yellow">- Jang-go. - Kim Mi-poong.</font>

619
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:50,316
<font color="yellow">I thought about it, and I realized we haven't done so many things together.</font>

620
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:53,547
<font color="yellow">I thought we would have a lot of time together.</font>

621
00:45:53,642 --> 00:45:57,837
<font color="yellow">That's why I thought we could do things later.</font>

622
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,015
<font color="yellow">But I regret that now.</font>

623
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,433
<font color="yellow">I did this so that we can do the things we didn't</font>

624
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,420
<font color="yellow">do before during this consideration period.</font>

625
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:09,204
<font color="yellow">I'll apologize for using Yoo-sung. That was my fault.</font>

626
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:13,551
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, how many times must I tell you?</font>

627
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:17,157
<font color="yellow">We can't get back together. We have no choice.</font>

628
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:20,111
<font color="yellow">Why don't we have a choice? We can get back together. I believe so.</font>

629
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:23,635
<font color="yellow">Is divorce a joke to you? Do you think you can do as you please?</font>

630
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:27,275
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, I did what you wanted me to do.</font>

631
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:31,143
<font color="yellow">Then it's your turn to do something I want you to do.</font>

632
00:46:31,783 --> 00:46:34,571
<font color="yellow">I need some time. Time to reflect and heal.</font>

633
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,672
<font color="yellow">Aunt! Uncle!</font>

634
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,751
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

635
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:43,628
<font color="yellow">I'm done eating this. I want to go on a ride.</font>

636
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:44,955
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

637
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,860
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, while we're here today, let's just</font>

638
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,664
<font color="yellow">forget about everything and have fun. Okay?</font>

639
00:46:53,408 --> 00:46:56,610
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, let's go!</font>

640
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,217
<font color="yellow">Should we go on a ride?</font>

641
00:47:07,642 --> 00:47:10,509
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

642
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,735
<font color="yellow">Uncle!</font>

643
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:22,165

<font color="yellow">That's my father! Father!</font>

647
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:57,468
<font color="yellow">- Father! - Mi-poong!</font>

648

<font color="yellow">That's my father! Father!</font>

649
00:48:00,205 --> 00:48:04,290
<font color="yellow">Jang-go! Excuse me! Please let me down!</font>

650
00:48:04,822 --> 00:48:08,051
<font color="yellow">- That's my father! - Mi-poong, what's wrong?</font>

651
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:10,538
<font color="yellow">My father is over there! Jang-go!</font>

652
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:15,017
<font color="yellow">Father. Father!</font>

653
00:48:22,806 --> 00:48:29,009

655
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:36,298
<font color="yellow">Where did you go?</font>

656
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,720
<font color="yellow">I was so scared! I thought I had lost you!</font>

657
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:42,456
<font color="yellow">I was looking around.</font>

658
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:44,931
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you wanted to ride something?</font>

659
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:47,435
<font color="yellow">- The merry-go-round. - Yes, the merry-go-round.</font>

660
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,423
<font color="yellow">It's that way. Let's go.</font>

661
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,983
<font color="yellow">- It's fun! - It's fun?</font>

675
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:43,980
<font color="yellow">I have an idea, so follow me.</font>

677
00:49:56,963 --> 00:49:59,638
<font color="yellow">Will you write down his name and anything special about him?</font>

678
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:06,579
<font color="yellow">We're looking for a person. Kim Mi-poong is</font>

679
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:10,016
<font color="yellow">searching for Kim Dae-hoon from Pyeongyang.</font>

681
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:16,090
<font color="yellow">the information desk in front of the front gate.</font>

<font color="yellow">My father.</font>

684
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:24,971
<font color="yellow">Your grandfather.</font>

685
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,556
<font color="yellow">My grandfather?</font>

686
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:28,736
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

687
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:31,228
<font color="yellow">Wow! I have a grandfather?</font>

688
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:05,399
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, no matter how many times I think about it, this is wrong.</font>

689
00:51:09,337 --> 00:51:12,733
<font color="yellow">This is all Shin-ae's fault!</font>

690
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:15,127
<font color="yellow">You weren't always such a terrible person!</font>

691
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,876
<font color="yellow">You became like this after you met her. Do you know that?</font>

692
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:21,192
<font color="yellow">Mom, Shin-ae is Hee-dong's wife! What's going to happen to Hee-dong?</font>

693
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:23,597
<font color="yellow">You need to tell him the truth now!</font>

694
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:25,855
<font color="yellow">If you can't, I will.</font>

695
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:27,509
<font color="yellow">You're crazy!</font>

696
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:30,814
<font color="yellow">If you're going to be like this, get out of this house!</font>

697
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:34,621
<font color="yellow">What? You horrible wench!</font>

698
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:38,812
<font color="yellow">Whatever! You can call me whatever you want, but I won't go back to the old days!</font>

699
00:51:39,128 --> 00:51:41,423
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die than live poorly again!</font>

700
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:44,321
<font color="yellow">If you're going to say those things, just leave!</font>

701
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:47,496
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll leave.</font>

702
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:50,828
<font color="yellow">I don't have any attachments to this house any longer!</font>

703
00:51:56,002 --> 00:52:00,329
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. What is wrong with her?</font>

704
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,677
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Bye.</font>

705
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,829
<font color="yellow">Come again.</font>

706
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,079
<font color="yellow">Oh, grandma!</font>

707
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,730
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra. - What are you doing here?</font>

708
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:15,205
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

709
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:17,100
<font color="yellow">You reek of alcohol!</font>

710
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:19,165
<font color="yellow">Did you drink?</font>

711
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:24,095
<font color="yellow">Grandma, what's wrong?</font>

712
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:25,894
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

713
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:32,564
<font color="yellow">I left home. I'm not going back.</font>

714
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,119
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

715
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,113
<font color="yellow">Did you fight with mom?</font>

716
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,279
<font color="yellow">Did you play flower cards again? Is that why you two fought?</font>

717
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:40,634
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

718
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:43,548
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

719
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,681
<font color="yellow">Did something upsetting happen at home?</font>

720
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,923
<font color="yellow">The truth is, Hee-ra...</font>

721
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,126
<font color="yellow">Never mind. What's the point of telling you this?</font>

722
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,458
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated.</font>

723
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:08,462

00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:16,329
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

727
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,642
<font color="yellow">Of course now.</font>

728
00:53:20,142 --> 00:53:24,878
<font color="yellow">How about we go get some rice wine together?</font>

729
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:29,032
<font color="yellow">Sure. That's not hard to do at all.</font>

00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:36,259
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

736
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,803
<font color="yellow">This will be enough to buy a small store.</font>

737
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:42,049
<font color="yellow">You should get a store.</font>

738

<font color="yellow">I don't have any other intentions.</font>

741
00:54:49,313 --> 00:54:50,851
<font color="yellow">It's not like I don't know you.</font>

742
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:54,338
<font color="yellow">On top of that, I already saw you being humiliated</font>

<font color="yellow">after doing business outside during this cold weather.</font>

744

<font color="yellow">I have no reason to take this money from you.</font>

747
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:08,729
<font color="yellow">If you're so burdened, you can work hard and pay me back.</font>

748
00:55:09,178 --> 00:55:13,999
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, I'm very grateful to you,</font>

749
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:16,819
<font color="yellow">but this isn't right.</font>

750
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:19,572
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

751
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:22,866
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo.</font>

752
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:33,014
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo. Ms. Joo, hold on.</font>

753
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:37,361
<font color="yellow">If I make you so uncomfortable,</font>

754
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:41,397
<font color="yellow">I won't act like I know you, even if we coincidentally run into each other.</font>

755
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:42,592
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

756
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,752
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't suffer like you did today.</font>

757
00:55:46,186 --> 00:55:48,529
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't suffer through such trouble like the ones</font>

758
00:55:50,049 --> 00:55:52,404
<font color="yellow">you experienced at my restaurant and on the streets today.</font>

759
00:55:53,928 --> 00:55:55,548
<font color="yellow">Why can't you know my feelings?</font>

760
00:55:56,225 --> 00:55:59,845
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I know your feelings?</font>

761
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:06,686
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I want to lean against such a grateful person like you?</font>

762
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:09,335
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo...</font>

763
00:56:10,186 --> 00:56:11,319
<font color="yellow">I'm a woman, too.</font>

764
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:17,292
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't been Mi-poong's mom...</font>

765
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,710
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't been Yoo-sung's grandma...</font>

766
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:23,147
<font color="yellow">And if you hadn't been a man with a family already...</font>

767
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:28,083
<font color="yellow">I would have leaned against you and relied on you.</font>

768
00:56:29,365 --> 00:56:34,920
<font color="yellow">But you and I shouldn't do that.</font>

769
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:40,467
<font color="yellow">How can people just do whatever they want?</font>

770
00:56:41,928 --> 00:56:43,787
<font color="yellow">That's not what we should do as human beings.</font>

771
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:55,270
<font color="yellow">So that's why I think this is the end of you and me.</font>

772
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:03,951
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything you did for me so far.</font>

773
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:06,258
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget it.</font>

774
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:09,374
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

775
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:38,843
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. You should stop drinking now. You've already drank so much.</font>

776
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,037
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk at all.</font>

777
00:57:41,577 --> 00:57:44,635
<font color="yellow">I'm a pretty heavy drinker.</font>

778
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:50,130
<font color="yellow">Still, wouldn't your family be worried? It's pretty late.</font>

779
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:56,967
<font color="yellow">There's no one waiting or worrying about me at home,</font>

780
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:58,412
<font color="yellow">so it's fine.</font>

781
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,651
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that's not the case.</font>

782
00:58:00,819 --> 00:58:02,950
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't they worry about you?</font>

783
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,069
<font color="yellow">Truth be told, I was kicked out of the house, so I don't have anywhere else to go.</font>

784
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:11,740
<font color="yellow">What? You were kicked out?</font>

785
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,249
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

786
00:58:15,756 --> 00:58:17,217
<font color="yellow">- Dal-rae. - Yes?</font>

787
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:23,565
<font color="yellow">This isn't about my family. It's about a family I know.</font>

788
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,351
<font color="yellow">Will you listen and tell me if I'm wrong or not?</font>

789
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:29,442
<font color="yellow">Sure, go ahead.</font>

790
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:36,319
<font color="yellow">The grandfather of this family I know very well  is extremely wealthy.</font>

791
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:41,717
<font color="yellow">However, he doesn't have one bloodline in this world.</font>

792
00:58:41,742 --> 00:58:43,764
<font color="yellow">Is this about your in-law Mr. Kim?</font>

793
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:47,583
<font color="yellow">Heavens, no! This is about another family!</font>

794
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:53,288
<font color="yellow">He just managed to find his granddaughter,</font>

795
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:57,293
<font color="yellow">but she's an imposter.</font>

796
00:58:57,764 --> 00:59:03,565
<font color="yellow">So do I have to tell him the truth or just ignore it?</font>

797
00:59:03,913 --> 00:59:10,583
<font color="yellow">So the granddaughter your in-law Mr.Kim, the owner of the house, found last time...</font>

798
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,334
<font color="yellow">is an imposter?</font>

799
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:15,241
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

800
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:18,115
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. What are you talking about?</font>

801
00:59:19,373 --> 00:59:26,586
<font color="yellow">No! I don't know what I just said, but I'm so drunk that I'm just talking nonsense!</font>

802
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:28,614
<font color="yellow">Forget about it!</font>

803
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,911
<font color="yellow">You're pretty drunk right now. You should go after you sober up.</font>

804
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:32,936
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

805
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:39,314
<font color="yellow">You can never tell anyone what I just told you right now.</font>

806
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:40,920
<font color="yellow">It was all nonsense!</font>

807
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:44,201
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye! - Gwi-ok! Hold on!</font>

808
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:48,600
<font color="yellow">Gwi-ok, I'll take you home. Let's go together.</font>

809
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,279
<font color="yellow">Don't come out.</font>

810
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:55,334
<font color="yellow">- But... - You can never tell anyone what I just told you right now.</font>

811
00:59:55,446 --> 00:59:59,112
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Hold on...</font>

812
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,680
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. If what she said was true, this is awful!</font>

813
01:00:09,092 --> 01:00:12,827
<font color="yellow">Mother, wasn't that Ms. Chun?</font>

814
01:00:13,452 --> 01:00:16,529
<font color="yellow">She seemed to be Chung-ja's mother, but why was she leaving in such a hurry?</font>

815
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:19,665
<font color="yellow">It's because she was shocked after telling me</font>

816
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:22,615
<font color="yellow">something she shouldn't have while she was drunk.</font>

817
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:31,066
<font color="yellow">- Do you know the granddaughter that her in-law Mr. Kim found last time? - Yes.</font>

818
01:00:31,303 --> 01:00:33,786
<font color="yellow">She's an imposter!</font>

819
01:00:34,202 --> 01:00:35,467
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

820
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,967
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

821
01:00:37,655 --> 01:00:38,855
<font color="yellow">She's an imposter?</font>

822
01:00:41,413 --> 01:00:45,145
<font color="yellow">You two look so cute and pretty.</font>

823
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:49,006
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae. Yoo-jin. Do you like them?</font>

824
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:51,131
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

825
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:55,580
<font color="yellow">I like it, but I don't have to wear this outside, do I?</font>

826
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:58,647
<font color="yellow">I think everyone will stare at me if I go outside like this.</font>

827
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:06,591
<font color="yellow">Still, he tried so hard to pick a present for you, so make sure you wear it often.</font>

828
01:01:07,022 --> 01:01:08,022
<font color="yellow">Thanks, dad.</font>

829
01:01:08,858 --> 01:01:09,920
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

830
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:20,177
<font color="yellow">But since you two are wearing the same headbands, you two look just like each other.</font>

831
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:24,179
<font color="yellow">You're like mother and daughter.</font>

832
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:34,997
<font color="yellow">Is that so? I think Yoo-jin looks more like me.</font>

833
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,993
<font color="yellow">No, she looks more like Shin-ae.</font>

834
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:43,494
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon is right. Sorry, Hee-dong. Yoo-jin looks more like Shin-ae than you.</font>

835
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, well.</font>

836
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:47,428
<font color="yellow">But it's so strange.</font>

837
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,046
<font color="yellow">My father and I look very alike.</font>

838
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:54,427
<font color="yellow">So why don't Shin-ae and I look alike?</font>

839
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:57,397
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

840
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,803
<font color="yellow">We don't look alike?</font>

841
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:05,235
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae must look like her mom then.</font>

842
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:10,612
<font color="yellow">Wow. If you look like your mother, then she must've been a real beauty.</font>

843
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:15,225
<font color="yellow">What did you do at the amusement park today?</font>

844
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:21,835
<font color="yellow">We went on the merry-go-ground, bumper cars, and viking.</font>

845
01:02:23,201 --> 01:02:25,907
<font color="yellow">- That one's scary. - Father, let's go again.</font>

846
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:27,077
<font color="yellow">Again?</font>

847
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:31,874
<font color="yellow">What am I doing going on all these rides after I met you?</font>

848
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:36,725
<font color="yellow">Let's all go together next time.</font>

849
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,451
<font color="yellow">Yes. As long as Mi-poong's family goes to America, there will be no problems.</font>

850
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,688
<font color="yellow">He's just a ten-year-old child living in the body of an adult.</font>

851
01:02:47,186 --> 01:02:49,217
<font color="yellow">This is another announcement.</font>

852
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:54,788
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong is searching for Kim Dae-hoon from Pyeongyang.</font>

853
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:58,082
<font color="yellow">If you hear his, Mr. Kim Dae-hoon, please come</font>

854
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,595
<font color="yellow">to the information desk in front of the gate.</font>

855
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:02,979
<font color="yellow">- One more time... - Jang-go.</font>

856
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:06,555
<font color="yellow">We made an announcement, so why isn't he coming?</font>

857
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:11,729
<font color="yellow">It was really him. He really was my father.</font>

858
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:16,201
<font color="yellow">What if he was just someone who resembled your father?</font>

859
01:03:17,913 --> 01:03:19,180
<font color="yellow">That might be true.</font>

860
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:21,061
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

861
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,025
<font color="yellow">You said he made eye-contact with you.</font>

862
01:03:23,651 --> 01:03:26,115
<font color="yellow">If he really was your father, he wouldn't have just left.</font>

863
01:03:26,717 --> 01:03:30,178
<font color="yellow">You're right. There's no way my father wouldn't recognize me.</font>

864
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:33,873
<font color="yellow">I think you're right.</font>

865
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:37,092
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

866
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,247
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung seems to be very tired.</font>

867
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:10,733
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you have something to tell me? Did something happen today?</font>

868
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,826
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

869
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:16,843
<font color="yellow">to be honest, at the amusement park today...</font>

870
01:04:18,975 --> 01:04:20,375
<font color="yellow">I think I saw father.</font>

871
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:25,772
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious?</font>

872
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:29,707
<font color="yellow">I thought I saw wrong...</font>

873
01:04:30,694 --> 01:04:32,817
<font color="yellow">but no matter how many times I think about this...</font>

874
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,418
<font color="yellow">I think he really was father.</font>

875
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:38,293
<font color="yellow">Tell me the details. How did you see him?</font>

876
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:42,624
<font color="yellow">We were on a ride, and father was right in front of me.</font>

877
01:04:42,967 --> 01:04:44,842
<font color="yellow">What? Right in front of you?</font>

878
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:50,529
<font color="yellow">I couldn't get off the ride, so I called for him, and we made eye-contact...</font>

879
01:04:51,491 --> 01:04:54,811
<font color="yellow">but he just left...</font>

880
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:57,693
<font color="yellow">What? He saw you but just left?</font>

881
01:04:58,702 --> 01:05:02,034
<font color="yellow">Did I just see someone who resembled him?</font>

882
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:04,371
<font color="yellow">No, he is your father!</font>

883
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:07,449
<font color="yellow">Last time I saw him, I thought I saw wrong, too, but</font>

884
01:05:07,474 --> 01:05:10,223
<font color="yellow">that's not the case. How can I mistaken your father?</font>

885
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:12,197
<font color="yellow">I really saw father, too.</font>

886
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:14,433
<font color="yellow">But why did he just leave after seeing me?</font>

887
01:05:14,608 --> 01:05:16,168
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

888
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:19,206
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't he have a reason for doing that?</font>

889
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,170
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, let's look for your father.</font>

890
01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:30,091
<font color="yellow">Your father could be alive. He could be alive and here in South Korea.</font>

891
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:37,710
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, your father's face was so vivid in my dreams.</font>
