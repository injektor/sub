00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:08,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Park Shin-ae. Park Shin-ae!</font>

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,421
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Hee-dong.</font>

4
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:16,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't forgive me.</font>

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,073
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't forgive you. I won't forgive you!</font>

6
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,088
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to kill you.</font>

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, I'm not worthy
enough to die in your hands.</font>

8
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:29,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not human. I even abandoned my child.</font>

9
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:30,477
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong.</font>

10
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't commit any sins
because of a woman like me.</font>

11
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:38,046
<font color=#FFFF00>If you tell me to die, I will.</font>

12
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:42,937
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll die. I'll die by myself.</font>

13
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,125
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll die.</font>

14
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Do you think it's all over if you die?</font>

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what about me and Yoo-jin?</font>

16
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do it? Why
did you do this to me?</font>

17
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:02,708
<font color=#FFFF00>What was I to you?</font>

18
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,046
<font color=#FFFF00>I was so good to you.</font>

19
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,343
<font color=#FFFF00>My name is Kang Mi-jung.</font>

20
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:12,695
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thirty years old.</font>

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,137
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom's name is Kang Bok-soon.</font>

22
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,039
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know who my father is.</font>

23
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:27,960
<font color=#FFFF00>The only thing I remember from my
childhood is that I was hungry every day.</font>

24
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:31,937
<font color=#FFFF00>I was always hungry.</font>

25
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:42,164
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom died from starvation because
she fed me first to keep me alive.</font>

26
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:48,062
<font color=#FFFF00>I was a poor homeless child in North Korea.</font>

27
00:01:56,664 --> 00:02:03,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Who on earth gave the beautiful name "kotjebi"
to pathetic homeless children like me?</font>

28
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,897
<font color=#FFFF00>At first, I stole food.</font>

29
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,513
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I stole clothes.</font>

30
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,833
<font color=#FFFF00>After that, I stole money.</font>

31
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,134
<font color=#FFFF00>I stole everything I could.</font>

32
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,318
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how I managed to survive.</font>

33
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,412
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't a human being.</font>

34
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,162
<font color=#FFFF00>I was a beast.</font>

35
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,631
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

36
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,818
<font color=#FFFF00>after I met you, I was
happy for the first time.</font>

37
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I realized that this is how
you live like a human being.</font>

38
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:56,397
<font color=#FFFF00>For the first time, I started to live
like a human being rather than a beast.</font>

39
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:02,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything was a lie.</font>

40
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,630
<font color=#FFFF00>My name. My hometown. My age. Everything.</font>

41
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,396
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have loved you.</font>

42
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:15,083
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have left you, but I couldn't.</font>

43
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,654
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry.</font>

44
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,224
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

45
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:33,716
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you...</font>

46
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,802
<font color=#FFFF00>for loving me.</font>

47
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:42,530
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't forget this even if I die.</font>

48
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,529
<font color=#FFFF00>If you had any sincere feelings for me,</font>

49
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,388
<font color=#FFFF00>live and get your punishment.</font>

50
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,503
<font color=#FFFF00>- (Last Episode)
- The weather is great today.</font>

51
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:34,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dae-hoon, are you good at golfing?
- You can teach me, father.</font>

52
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:37,152
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have fun.
- Thank you.</font>

53
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:38,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a good time.</font>

54
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:41,394
<font color=#FFFF00>Young-ae, learn how to play golf so
that you can play with Dae-hoon.</font>

55
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,206
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, father. I'll do that.</font>

56
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,231
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. Mi-poong. I'll be back.</font>

57
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:53,035
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go in.</font>

58
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:54,676
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo.</font>

59
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:57,386
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong.</font>

60
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,284
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

61
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,663
<font color=#FFFF00>I've committed a grave sin.</font>

62
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me.</font>

63
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:54,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you'll be
forgiven if we forgive you?</font>

64
00:05:58,152 --> 00:06:01,816
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to the beach to die...</font>

65
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,769
<font color=#FFFF00>but I couldn't and just came back.</font>

66
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I've committed such a grave
sin to you and Mi-poong.</font>

67
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:21,026
<font color=#FFFF00>If I had just died like that, I felt like
I was committing an even graver sin.</font>

68
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:29,503
<font color=#FFFF00>And I don't think I should commit anymore
sins for the sake of my innocent Yoo-jin.</font>

69
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,792
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I came back.</font>

70
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,105
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry.</font>

71
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:45,636
<font color=#FFFF00>We want to forget about you. We
don't even want to think about you.</font>

72
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, let's go.</font>

73
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,042
<font color=#FFFF00>Park Shin-ae.</font>

74
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,119
<font color=#FFFF00>You are arrested for embezzlement, fraud,</font>

75
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:07,863
<font color=#FFFF00>kidnapping, confinement,
and attempted murder.</font>

76
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:10,876
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right</font>

77
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:13,449
<font color=#FFFF00>to an attorney. Anything you
say can be used against you.</font>

78
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,801
<font color=#FFFF00>Take her in.</font>

79
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:45,284
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going to leave?</font>

80
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

81
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:49,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Must you really leave?</font>

82
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:56,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather, I'm going to
forget about everything</font>

83
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,464
<font color=#FFFF00>on my trip and experience a lot of things.</font>

84
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:00,933
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

85
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,456
<font color=#FFFF00>If that's your plan, I can't stop you.</font>

86
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:11,535
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take care.</font>

87
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:15,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what you think,</font>

88
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:21,902
<font color=#FFFF00>but to me, you've always
been my reliable grandson.</font>

89
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:31,464
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't forget about me, and
don't be away for too long.</font>

90
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,730
<font color=#FFFF00>All right?</font>

91
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, grandfather.</font>

92
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:38,824
<font color=#FFFF00>Good.</font>

93
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:40,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care.</font>

94
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,190
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll call you.
- Okay.</font>

95
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,378
<font color=#FFFF00>How is your dad doing?</font>

96
00:08:56,191 --> 00:09:02,808
<font color=#FFFF00>Are there any women around his vicinity?</font>

97
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:04,573
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you watch him well.</font>

98
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:10,165
<font color=#FFFF00>Many gold diggers will flock around
him because of the inheritance.</font>

99
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:11,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it?</font>

100
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom...</font>

101
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,017
<font color=#FFFF00>don't be shocked.</font>

102
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,017
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

103
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong left.</font>

104
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,821
<font color=#FFFF00>W-what? Hee-dong left?</font>

105
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,150
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

106
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,970
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he...?</font>

107
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,642
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he leave Korea
without seeing me first?</font>

108
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,216
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not true, right?
You're lying, aren't you?</font>

109
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:44,837
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, he really left.</font>

110
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,188
<font color=#FFFF00>But don't get shocked.</font>

111
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,595
<font color=#FFFF00>He took Yoo-jin with him.</font>

112
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would he do that?</font>

113
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:58,321
<font color=#FFFF00>Just looking at her must drive him crazy
because she reminds him of Shin-ae!</font>

114
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,470
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems like Hee-dong is going
to raise Yoo-jin as his own.</font>

115
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,701
<font color=#FFFF00>That's ridiculous!</font>

116
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,738
<font color=#FFFF00>That can never happen as long as I live!</font>

117
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,524
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does he have to raise
that wench's daughter?</font>

118
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong, I'm sorry!</font>

119
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:16,863
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hee-dong!
- Mom!</font>

120
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,579
<font color=#FFFF00>- I need to get out of here! Hee-ra!
- Mom!</font>

121
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:22,624
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hee-ra, I'm so sorry!
- Mom!</font>

122
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:33,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, stop it! Don't hit my mom!</font>

123
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,298
<font color=#FFFF00>The defendant Park Shin-ae...</font>

124
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,126
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to be Kim Deok-cheon's
fake granddaughter,</font>

125
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:47,829
<font color=#FFFF00>has injured Joo Young-ae and
committed robbery from her and</font>

126
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:51,089
<font color=#FFFF00>kidnapped and confined
Kim Deok-cheon's son Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

127
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,352
<font color=#FFFF00>She has committed many
unforgivable crimes as a person.</font>

128
00:10:56,852 --> 00:11:02,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Therefore, according to
criminal law code 37,</font>

129
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,353
<font color=#FFFF00>defendant Park Shin-ae is
sentenced to ten years in prison.</font>

130
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:16,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Look here.</font>

131
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you.</font>

132
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:22,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet.</font>

133
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Big Boss is reading here.</font>

134
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,131
<font color=#FFFF00>- Quit your crying!
- Do you want to be beaten up again?</font>

135
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,223
<font color=#FFFF00>What the hell is she crying for?</font>

136
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,709
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you're the only one
here who has kids? Shut your mouth!</font>

137
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:39,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay quiet in that corner right over there.
Don't even dare breathe.</font>

138
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:46,775
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

139
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:48,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even breathe!</font>

140
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:56,376
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

141
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:01,165
<font color=#FFFF00>- You have one more roommate,
so don't fight and get along with her.
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

142
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye!</font>

143
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:05,939
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye!</font>

144
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:16,837
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you think you're sitting?</font>

145
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:18,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Come over here.</font>

146
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:21,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you. She's calling you.</font>

147
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:24,736
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, look at that glare.</font>

148
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,751
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you're so frightening.</font>

149
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:31,837
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you. Stop glaring at her.</font>

150
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Damn it! She told you stop glaring!</font>

151
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,806
<font color=#FFFF00>You horrible...</font>

152
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,061
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, inmate 4949, what did you just say?
- Mother...</font>

153
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
<font color=#FFFF00>You!</font>

154
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:45,156
<font color=#FFFF00>They say you'll run into
your worst enemy at the</font>

155
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,470
<font color=#FFFF00>worst place and time. I'm glad you came.
You wench!</font>

156
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:52,541
<font color=#FFFF00>You deserve to die! My life and my
son's life are ruined because of you!</font>

157
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:58,696
<font color=#FFFF00>- You wench! You made me get a divorce!
Give my son's lie back!
- Stop her!</font>

158
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,597
<font color=#FFFF00>- Guard!
- You wench!</font>

159
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:11,603
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop!
- I can't forgive you!</font>

160
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,192
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided to get back together with Jang-go.</font>

161
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,251
<font color=#FFFF00>We came to officially tell you that.</font>

162
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,454
<font color=#FFFF00>State it clearly here
that you'll get divorced.</font>

163
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:39,853
<font color=#FFFF00>I, Kim Mi-poong, will divorce Jang-go.</font>

164
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:44,431
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll never go back on my
words or change my mind.</font>

165
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,306
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't keep your promise,
you're not even human.</font>

166
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:54,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong and Jang-go can never be together.</font>

167
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:10,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Whose car is that?</font>

168
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,837
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no one in my family who
would ride such a nice car.</font>

169
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:29,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't she Mi-poong's mom?</font>

170
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:36,313
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. Jang-go and Mi-poong are back
together again. Is that what she's here for?</font>

171
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:43,454
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you came here because you
needed to tell me something.</font>

172
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,696
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come here because
of Jang-go and Mi-poong?</font>

173
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:50,064
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

174
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,415
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be honest with you.</font>

175
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:55,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, go ahead.</font>

176
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:03,806
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want Mi-poong to get
married into this family again.</font>

177
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,864
<font color=#FFFF00>Thinking of Jang-go breaks my heart,</font>

178
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:10,659
<font color=#FFFF00>but still, I don't think this is right.</font>

179
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:16,738
<font color=#FFFF00>I witnessed Mi-poong going through
such a hard time in this family.</font>

180
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:21,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Would she have left the
house and offered to get</font>

181
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,684
<font color=#FFFF00>a divorce if things hadn't been so terrible?</font>

182
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,873
<font color=#FFFF00>She did those things even though
she loved Jang-go so much.</font>

183
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:29,863
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

184
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:33,988
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't give permission.</font>

185
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,082
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

186
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:41,101
<font color=#FFFF00>If I'm wrong, please tell me so.</font>

187
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,433
<font color=#FFFF00>No, not at all.</font>

188
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:45,246
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand how you feel.</font>

189
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:49,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong met her grandfather and father now.</font>

190
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:56,858
<font color=#FFFF00>I want Mi-poong to forget all about her
sufferings and just live a happy life.</font>

191
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

192
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:06,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll talk to Jang-go.</font>

193
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:10,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, I'm so sorry.</font>

194
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,683
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll apologize instead.</font>

195
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:15,817
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

196
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:21,035
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm the one who's sorry, ma'am.</font>

197
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am, it's cold outside.
Please don't come out.</font>

198
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,754
<font color=#FFFF00>No. You're my guest. I should
at least walk you out.</font>

199
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,609
<font color=#FFFF00>She's opposing Jang-go because of me?</font>

200
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,511
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do?</font>

201
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,933
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't see you come in.</font>

202
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:05,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, now I see. You were
hiding back there like</font>

203
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,481
<font color=#FFFF00>a rat and eavesdropping on our conversation.</font>

204
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:10,949
<font color=#FFFF00>Good for you.</font>

205
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,136
<font color=#FFFF00>You must know what kind of
mess you've created again.</font>

206
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:22,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of you, Jang-go is about to
cry tears of blood again, you brat.</font>

207
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,589
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to make your child
walk on a path of flowers?</font>

208
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:31,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. Was this a path of flowers for you?</font>

209
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,699
<font color=#FFFF00>You broke your child's
heart, not once, but twice.</font>

210
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Our poor Jang-go.</font>

211
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:44,621
<font color=#FFFF00>He was cursed with a horrible mother.
What will he do now?</font>

212
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I'm sorry. Mother! Mother I'm sorry.</font>

213
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:55,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I'm sorry...</font>

214
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,144
<font color=#FFFF00>How does it feel working? Aren't you tired?</font>

215
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,801
<font color=#FFFF00>Not at all. I won't get
tired even if I have to</font>

216
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:07,191
<font color=#FFFF00>work straight for days
because it's so much fun.</font>

217
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,511
<font color=#FFFF00>You're amazing. I thought
you would be tired.</font>

218
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:12,824
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, it's right here.</font>

219
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,285
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

220
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:44,269
<font color=#FFFF00>I just feel a bit strange.</font>

221
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,332
<font color=#FFFF00>I had once lived here, but all those events</font>

222
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,270
<font color=#FFFF00>seem like they had happened a long time ago.</font>

223
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong.</font>

224
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:01,801
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

225
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:03,168
<font color=#FFFF00>For what?</font>

226
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,547
<font color=#FFFF00>Just everything.</font>

227
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,074
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm grateful you came
back here with me again.</font>

228
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:15,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what's wrong with me?
I'm nervous, like it's my first time here.</font>

229
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:20,550
<font color=#FFFF00>They know you already. It's not like
you're here for the first time.</font>

230
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:22,722
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go in. They'll welcome you.</font>

231
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:27,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, Mi-poong is here!</font>

232
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

233
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,805
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mi-poong!
- Mi-poong!</font>

234
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt Nam-yi. Jang-soo. Hee-ra.</font>

235
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom! Grandma! Come out! Mi-poong is here!</font>

236
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,441
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness.
- Grandma.</font>

237
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:45,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's this? Oh, my. Mi-poong.</font>

238
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:46,996
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandma.
- Mi-poong.</font>

239
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you been well?</font>

240
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:51,606
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, come on. Why are you tearing up?</font>

241
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:53,165
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sit down.
- Sit down.</font>

242
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,772
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sit down.
- Let's sit.</font>

243
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,428
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

244
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:04,069
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy for you.</font>

245
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you reunited with
your grandfather and father.</font>

246
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

247
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,990
<font color=#FFFF00>In the end, everyone will be reunited.</font>

248
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:17,115
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, mom. That's not all. Her
grandfather isn't a normal man.</font>

249
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,577
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the chairman of Winner's Group.</font>

250
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,694
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations, Mi-poong!
- Thank you, Aunt Nam-yi.</font>

251
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,858
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-ra, what are you doing?</font>

252
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Prepare some tea and fruit.</font>

253
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,287
<font color=#FFFF00>Me?</font>

254
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:35,779
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, grandma.</font>

255
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:41,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

256
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:43,514
<font color=#FFFF00>This is yours, grandma.</font>

257
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
<font color=#FFFF00>This is yours, aunt.</font>

258
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,490
<font color=#FFFF00>These are from Mi-poong.</font>

259
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness. What's this?</font>

260
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:56,584
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh! This is so pretty!
I always wanted a red wallet!</font>

261
00:20:56,882 --> 00:21:00,319
<font color=#FFFF00>And this is for Jang-soo and Hee-ra.</font>

262
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,365
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, what's this? Did you
buy something for us, too?</font>

263
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:06,443
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-ra, Mi-poong brought us a gift!</font>

264
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:08,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks, Mi-poong!</font>

265
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:13,803
<font color=#FFFF00>These are couple sunglasses!
I've always wanted these!</font>

266
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,010
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think? Do I look great?
- Yes.</font>

267
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:18,721
<font color=#FFFF00>You have great taste, Mi-poong!</font>

268
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,334
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did mom go? There's
a gift for her as well.</font>

269
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:26,022
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not home. She went out.</font>

270
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:36,694
<font color=#FFFF00>What is taking you so
long to bring some tea?</font>

271
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:40,194
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm almost done. I'll be there soon.</font>

272
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:56,467
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys, go to your rooms. I need to
talk to Jang-go and Mi-poong alone.</font>

273
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:58,365
<font color=#FFFF00>Go, Jang-soo and Hee-ra.</font>

274
00:21:58,975 --> 00:21:59,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, grandma.</font>

275
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:02,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go, Hee-ra.</font>

276
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

277
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:12,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong,</font>

278
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:20,647
<font color=#FFFF00>thank you for not forgetting
about me and coming to see me.</font>

279
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:24,647
<font color=#FFFF00>But don't come here again.</font>

280
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Today is the last day.</font>

281
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,709
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, what are you talking about?</font>

282
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:34,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, did I do something wrong?</font>

283
00:22:35,303 --> 00:22:37,904
<font color=#FFFF00>No. That's not what I mean.</font>

284
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:40,123
<font color=#FFFF00>We were the ones who did wrong.</font>

285
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:43,240
<font color=#FFFF00>You've done wrong to us.</font>

286
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,178
<font color=#FFFF00>But why are you telling me not to come?</font>

287
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:49,936
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to see you as often as possible.</font>

288
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:53,592
<font color=#FFFF00>You two got a divorce.</font>

289
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you two must go your different ways.</font>

290
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:02,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, I decided to get
back together with Jang-go.</font>

291
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:09,233
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I came to greet you, mother,
and the rest of the family members.</font>

292
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:14,513
<font color=#FFFF00>I, too, wished you two would
get back together again,</font>

293
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:18,561
<font color=#FFFF00>but you've suffered so much in this house.</font>

294
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:23,014
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be ridiculous for you to be
this family's daughter-in-law again.</font>

295
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:27,020
<font color=#FFFF00>I did have hard times,
but I was happy as well.</font>

296
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:30,686
<font color=#FFFF00>You always protected and loved me.</font>

297
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,186
<font color=#FFFF00>And I've forgotten all about the past.</font>

298
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,647
<font color=#FFFF00>I found my grandfather again,
so I won't be a burden to Jang-go anymore.</font>

299
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:42,920
<font color=#FFFF00>That's exactly why! I feel too guilty!</font>

300
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:46,037
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if that's the past, do you think it's</font>

301
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,530
<font color=#FFFF00>something that could be forgotten so easily?</font>

302
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:51,373
<font color=#FFFF00>If things hadn't been so terrible,</font>

303
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:56,983
<font color=#FFFF00>would your kind and calm mother
have come here to see me</font>

304
00:23:57,732 --> 00:24:00,076
<font color=#FFFF00>and requested me to keep you
two away from each other?</font>

305
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:02,381
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom came here?</font>

306
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,436
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, is that true?</font>

307
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:12,178
<font color=#FFFF00>So meet another good man</font>

308
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:15,694
<font color=#FFFF00>and start a new life with him.</font>

309
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,654
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home now.</font>

310
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,865
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma...</font>

311
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:47,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go.</font>

312
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

313
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:56,904
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea my mom would come here
and say such things to your grandma.</font>

314
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:59,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand your mother.</font>

315
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:04,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I was too selfish.</font>

316
00:25:04,741 --> 00:25:09,912
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, you can't think about
breaking up with me, okay?</font>

317
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

318
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's make an effort together.</font>

319
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:19,936
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, you're home?</font>

320
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,069
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

321
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:33,080
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true you asked Jang-go's
grandma to separate Jang-go and me?</font>

322
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

323
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:37,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it wrong to do so?</font>

324
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:41,545
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you ask his grandma to do that?</font>

325
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:47,201
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what was I supposed to do when you said
you're going to go back to that family?</font>

326
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:50,022
<font color=#FFFF00>You suffered so much
while staying with them.</font>

327
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:51,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw it with my own two eyes.</font>

328
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:55,373
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't enough that your
mother-in-law disrespected you.</font>

329
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,740
<font color=#FFFF00>She forced you to make a
hundred cabbages into kimchi.</font>

330
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,217
<font color=#FFFF00>You had to go to work, but she
forced you to make breakfast.</font>

331
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,045
<font color=#FFFF00>She flipped over the tables.</font>

332
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,537
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not all.</font>

333
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,348
<font color=#FFFF00>She came to the dumpling
diner, tried to take</font>

334
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:10,733
<font color=#FFFF00>your ring, and said all
those harsh words to you.</font>

335
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:14,771
<font color=#FFFF00>I can never forget those
things she did to you.</font>

336
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,999
<font color=#FFFF00>But you want me to send
you back to that house?</font>

337
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, his mother won't do that to me anymore.</font>

338
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:26,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Of course she won't.</font>

339
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:29,138
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the granddaughter of
the chairman of Winner's</font>

340
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Group now. She won't dare
give you a hard time anymore.</font>

341
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,990
<font color=#FFFF00>She won't change. She's a
materialistic woman who</font>

342
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:38,035
<font color=#FFFF00>is determined to find a
rich daughter-in-law.</font>

343
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,815
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not saying that I got back together
with Jang-go because I like his mother.</font>

344
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:44,803
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't give Jang-go up.</font>

345
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:49,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate the idea of having
such a woman as an in-law.</font>

346
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:54,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Time will help you forget everything.</font>

347
00:26:55,358 --> 00:27:00,561
<font color=#FFFF00>So meet another man in the future
and have a clean start with him.</font>

348
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:02,421
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

349
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:04,951
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never allow you and
Jang-go to be together.</font>

350
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,248
<font color=#FFFF00>When I think about how much you suffered
under his mother, I still get nightmares.</font>

351
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,334
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this about?</font>

352
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:16,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

353
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:17,507
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

354
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:19,537
<font color=#FFFF00>Is all of that true?</font>

355
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she force you to make kimchi
in that freezing weather,</font>

356
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:24,495
<font color=#FFFF00>flip the tables,</font>

357
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:27,514
<font color=#FFFF00>wrecked havoc in the dumpling diner,</font>

358
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:29,779
<font color=#FFFF00>and threatened you to divorce her son?</font>

359
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:31,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Did your mother-in-law really
do such things to you?</font>

360
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:35,608
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, father. That's why they got a divorce.</font>

361
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,858
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

362
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,834
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare she do those
things to my granddaughter.</font>

363
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:43,438
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like that.</font>

364
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:48,763
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's not, are you saying that the
things your mother said are untrue?</font>

365
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:52,466
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, well, they are true,</font>

366
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:56,232
<font color=#FFFF00>but Jang-go tried to help
mom and me until the end.</font>

367
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Because he was trying to help
us, he almost lost his house.</font>

368
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:03,709
<font color=#FFFF00>So I begged him for us to get
divorced, which is why we did.</font>

369
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,884
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, if you're going to
tell grandfather what</font>

370
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:07,561
<font color=#FFFF00>happened, you should tell him everything.</font>

371
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:11,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go tried not to get a divorce with
me, and he helped us until the end.</font>

372
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I opposing this because of Jang-go?</font>

373
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:16,419
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, listen to me carefully.</font>

374
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:23,040
<font color=#FFFF00>I can never allow you to get married
into such a family. End things with him.</font>

375
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:24,583
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

376
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:29,162
<font color=#FFFF00>How could she have been so cruel to you
when the two of had gotten married already?</font>

377
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,895
<font color=#FFFF00>She disrespected you for being
a poor North Korean defector.</font>

378
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:36,209
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't be in-laws with such a family.</font>

379
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:37,724
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather...</font>

380
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,404
<font color=#FFFF00>End of discussion.</font>

381
00:28:56,295 --> 00:28:57,295
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

382
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:01,935
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you cry? Is something wrong?</font>

383
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:03,881
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad...</font>

384
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:09,076
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? Tell me. I'll
solve everything for you.</font>

385
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:10,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

386
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,904
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

387
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,091
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I'm your father.</font>

388
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:18,834
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

389
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:23,435
<font color=#FFFF00>you're the only one who I'm telling this to.</font>

390
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,436
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the most powerful person in this house.</font>

391
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,584
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm telling
you that I'll solve it.</font>

392
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:31,990
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

393
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:36,209
<font color=#FFFF00>You thought your grandfather was the most
powerful one in this house, didn't you?</font>

394
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,443
<font color=#FFFF00>But your grandfather can't say no to me.</font>

395
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:46,794
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm the most
powerful one in this house.</font>

396
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it?</font>

397
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it.</font>

398
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell you everything, so
you must solve it for me.</font>

399
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:54,849
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

400
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me everything.</font>

401
00:30:07,468 --> 00:30:09,401
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I do about Mi-poong?</font>

402
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:17,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Since my father and wife are against this
relationship, I'll have to meet Jang-go.</font>

403
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:22,844
<font color=#FFFF00>So if I like him, I'm going
to fulfill Mi-poong's wish.</font>

404
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:28,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Who can it be?</font>

405
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:32,678
<font color=#FFFF00>(Yoo-jin)</font>

406
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:33,702
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Yoo-jin!</font>

407
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,226
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin?</font>

408
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:38,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did Yoo-jin text you?</font>

409
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin and I are friends.</font>

410
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather Dae-hoon, I'm in Cuba with
Mr. Jo Hee-dong.</font>

411
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:52,077
<font color=#FFFF00>The weather is great, and
everyone here is so much fun.</font>

412
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:55,483
<font color=#FFFF00>But Mr. Jo Hee-dong doesn't smile.</font>

413
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:00,873
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I'm going
to make him smile again.</font>

414
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-jin is so smart.</font>

415
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:08,975
<font color=#FFFF00>He seemed like such a good person.
He just had to meet the wrong woman.</font>

416
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,210
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

417
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:16,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I don't remember the past,
I'm still living happily like this.</font>

418
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:22,069
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong will be happy again soon.</font>

419
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:27,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's look at it together.</font>

420
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,021
<font color=#FFFF00>- She sent you pictures?
- Cute, right?</font>

421
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:48,577
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it? Huh?</font>

422
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Who the hell is snoring?</font>

423
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:56,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Quit your snoring!</font>

424
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my stomach...</font>

425
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,054
<font color=#FFFF00>My stomach...</font>

426
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, are you okay?</font>

427
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,107
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you damn, evil wench!</font>

428
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,584
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you use violence!</font>

429
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,046
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you don't snore? You
better apologize to my mother-in-law!</font>

430
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:25,264
<font color=#FFFF00>- Apologize to her at once!
- I think I'm done sleeping tonight.</font>

431
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You young, little thing. You con-artist.</font>

432
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of her hair.</font>

433
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to change the order of your ribs!</font>

434
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,147
<font color=#FFFF00>You con-artists from a messy family!</font>

435
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:49,272
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Con-artists? From a messy family?</font>

436
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:50,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's what I said!</font>

437
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold tightly onto her!</font>

438
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,741
<font color=#FFFF00>If you treat my mother-in-law disrespectfully
one more time, I'll get you.</font>

439
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:21,296
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I'm sorry, girls.</font>

440
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:25,077
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get along well from now on.</font>

441
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,127
<font color=#FFFF00>She's my daughter-in-law.</font>

442
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:31,436
<font color=#FFFF00>Daughter. In. Law.</font>

443
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, lie over there.</font>

444
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, come here! This is the warmest spot!</font>

445
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:43,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here.</font>

446
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:46,871
<font color=#FFFF00>The new Big Boss should
lie down next to her.</font>

447
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,796
<font color=#FFFF00>Please lie down.</font>

448
00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:55,569
<font color=#FFFF00>You can relax your eyes now.</font>

449
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,796
<font color=#FFFF00>- Turn off the light.
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

450
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:04,327
<font color=#FFFF00>- Turn off the light!
- We must turn off the light!</font>

451
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Good night.</font>

452
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:14,132
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too cramped here! Move over! Gosh!</font>

453
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae.</font>

454
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

455
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

456
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:11,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, the mother of
Lawyer Lee Jang-go is here.</font>

457
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:13,734
<font color=#FFFF00>Who?</font>

458
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:18,087
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

459
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:20,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

460
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:22,860
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard Mi-poong...</font>

461
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,952
<font color=#FFFF00>found her grandfather and father.</font>

462
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:29,995
<font color=#FFFF00>I sincerely congratulate you.</font>

463
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,639
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come all the way here just for that?</font>

464
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:35,819
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is...</font>

465
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:39,913
<font color=#FFFF00>I came for Jang-go and Mi-poong.</font>

466
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,718
<font color=#FFFF00>About Jang-go and Mi-poong?</font>

467
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,655
<font color=#FFFF00>They're divorced now. They
don't have anything to do with</font>

468
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,452
<font color=#FFFF00>each other. So what do you
need to tell me about them?</font>

469
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:53,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong came over to my house,</font>

470
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:59,155
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was too ashamed to face
her, so I couldn't even see her.</font>

471
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:06,491
<font color=#FFFF00>I know very well that I have
no right to come here either.</font>

472
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:12,522
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, I mustered up the courage
to come here for the kids' sakes.</font>

473
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,654
<font color=#FFFF00>"Kids' sakes?"</font>

474
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,101
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

475
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,147
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the one who's at fault here.</font>

476
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:25,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You know very well that Jang-go
didn't do anything wrong.</font>

477
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:30,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Just think of me as a dead person.</font>

478
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:36,783
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you allow them to get re-married?</font>

479
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:44,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you forget what you did to Mi-poong?</font>

480
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:47,725
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you do to my daughter?</font>

481
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,554
<font color=#FFFF00>You couldn't possibly have
forgotten all about it.</font>

482
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:57,131
<font color=#FFFF00>Even now, I remember how you tossed out
all her belongings to the front yard.</font>

483
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,777
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't forget how you
yelled at her to get out.</font>

484
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,970
<font color=#FFFF00>But now you want me to allow
them to get remarried?</font>

485
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:10,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Look here!</font>

486
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,662
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of here before
I say harsher things to you.</font>

487
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:16,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Housekeeper!</font>

488
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:21,725
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, ma'am.
- Tell this woman to get out of here at once.</font>

489
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:24,257
<font color=#FFFF00>And don't ever open the
front gate for her again.</font>

490
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:26,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo...</font>

491
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I've committed a grave sin.</font>

492
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:33,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll severe mother-son ties with Jang-go.</font>

493
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:38,343
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll cut ties with him and live somewhere
far away. That works, doesn't it?</font>

494
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:45,960
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really regretting what I've done.</font>

495
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:51,247
<font color=#FFFF00>I was blinded by greed,
so even though I knew</font>

496
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:54,249
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong was a nice woman,
I pretended not to notice.</font>

497
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:56,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

498
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:59,522
<font color=#FFFF00>It's late, but I'll apologize now.</font>

499
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,421
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wrong.</font>

500
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:10,819
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll apologize! I'm sorry!</font>

501
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me, Ms. Joo!</font>

502
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,107
<font color=#FFFF00>I've committed a grave sin!</font>

503
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:19,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll cut ties with him!</font>

504
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:22,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me!</font>

505
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:26,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I've committed a grave sin, Ms. Joo!
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!</font>

506
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:33,304
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Joo, I've committed a grave sin!
I'm sorry!</font>

507
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:51,265
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how much I think of
it, I can't understand why your</font>

508
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:54,507
<font color=#FFFF00>grandfather and mother would
be against you and Jang-go.</font>

509
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:58,163
<font color=#FFFF00>From what I see, he seems
like a good person.</font>

510
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:00,475
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is,</font>

511
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:03,999
<font color=#FFFF00>it's not because of Jang-go-</font>

512
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:08,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. It's because his
mother was mean to you.</font>

513
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:16,405
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's you and Jang-go who are
getting married. Why does that matter?</font>

514
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:18,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Right?</font>

515
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:23,116
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. So don't worry about it.
I'll solve everything for you.</font>

516
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:29,757
<font color=#FFFF00>But what do you like about Jang-go?</font>

517
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,710
<font color=#FFFF00>He's good at playing slap match.</font>

518
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:36,788
<font color=#FFFF00>He's pretty good-looking.</font>

519
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,421
<font color=#FFFF00>More importantly, he's fun.</font>

520
00:39:41,468 --> 00:39:43,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate people who are no fun.</font>

521
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,374
<font color=#FFFF00>But Mi-poong, why must you marry Jang-go?</font>

522
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:57,805
<font color=#FFFF00>During my most shabby and difficult
times, he was there for me.</font>

523
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:03,375
<font color=#FFFF00>When I was falsely accused, he
was the one who believed in me.</font>

524
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:07,874
<font color=#FFFF00>When I was searching for
you, he helped me, too.</font>

525
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:15,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, the only one I want to
marry in this world is Jang-go.</font>

526
00:40:18,718 --> 00:40:19,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

527
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,710
<font color=#FFFF00>What fun things are you
talking about without us?</font>

528
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:31,663
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go.</font>

529
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:35,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Son-in-law.</font>

530
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,311
<font color=#FFFF00>I can call you that, right?</font>

531
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, father.</font>

532
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:48,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong said she wants to marry you.</font>

533
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you feel the same way, too?</font>

534
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:51,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Say it like a man.</font>

535
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:54,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to marry my daughter?</font>

536
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, sir!</font>

537
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have the confidence
to make her happy forever?</font>

538
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:05,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I do!</font>

539
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:07,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

540
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

541
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,321
<font color=#FFFF00>I shall grant you permission
to be Mi-poong's husband!</font>

542
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:21,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Do you mean it?</font>

543
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you! Thank you, father!</font>

544
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,356
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be really good to her!</font>

545
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, have a hot dog.</font>

546
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:36,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

547
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:38,046
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, grandpa! You're the best!</font>

548
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:44,282
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll open it for you.</font>

549
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:46,234
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

550
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:50,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

551
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:53,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did she go? The market?</font>

552
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:06,061
<font color=#FFFF00>To my dearest son Jang-go,</font>

553
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:08,163
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

554
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:12,600
<font color=#FFFF00>No words can justify my actions.</font>

555
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:16,562
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I was doing the best for you,</font>

556
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:22,272
<font color=#FFFF00>but now that I look back,
it was just for my greed.</font>

557
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:27,509
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come out.
- Don't you ever come near Jang-go again!</font>

558
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:29,667
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hurry up!
- I'll get you then!</font>

559
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,288
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I'm going to get
sick just looking at you.</font>

560
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:38,752
<font color=#FFFF00>So can't you leave Jang-go now and
take your family out of my house?</font>

561
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,936
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I was such a greedy, flippant mom.</font>

562
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:54,391
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, pretend I don't exist. I hope
you'll live a happy life with Mi-poong.</font>

563
00:42:56,398 --> 00:42:59,257
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I'm very sorry.</font>

564
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:01,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Please be healthy.</font>

565
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,843
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-soo.</font>

566
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:07,546
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-ra.</font>

567
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:09,609
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

568
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:12,850
<font color=#FFFF00>From, your terrible mother.</font>

569
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:20,304
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom...</font>

570
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma! Aunt!</font>

571
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, grandma.</font>

572
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:41,889
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

573
00:43:43,273 --> 00:43:44,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'll be home soon.</font>

574
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:46,062
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye.</font>

575
00:43:46,531 --> 00:43:49,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, what is it? Is something wrong?</font>

576
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:52,733
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's nothing. Take your father inside.</font>

577
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,639
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo-sung, see you later.</font>

578
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,124
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye, uncle.</font>

579
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Good-bye, father.</font>

580
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,406
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye. Let's play a game next time.</font>

581
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:04,843
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Bye.</font>

582
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:07,520
<font color=#FFFF00>- Drive safely.
- I will. Go on in.</font>

583
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, have some tea.</font>

584
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:22,671
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sure.
- We're back.</font>

585
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,624
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandfather.
- Oh, you're home, Yoo-sung?</font>

586
00:44:26,273 --> 00:44:30,641
<font color=#FFFF00>- Welcome! Weren't you cold?
- Where did the three of you go?</font>

587
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:35,397
<font color=#FFFF00>We went to the amusement park with Jang-go.</font>

588
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:36,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go?</font>

589
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,363
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, your grandfather and
I told you very clearly that</font>

590
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,920
<font color=#FFFF00>you can't be with Jang-go. What
do you think you're doing?</font>

591
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, what are you saying?</font>

592
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:52,694
<font color=#FFFF00>They love each other, so
why are you opposing them?</font>

593
00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:58,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, stay out of this. Let
Young-ae take care of this.</font>

594
00:44:58,311 --> 00:45:02,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, I'm Mi-poong's father, so why
are you telling me to stay out of this?</font>

595
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:10,147
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a reason for that. That's why
Young-ae and I are against this.</font>

596
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:17,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, let's settle this once and for all.</font>

597
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:21,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Mi-poong my daughter or yours?</font>

598
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:23,636
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be the one to stay out of this!</font>

599
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:28,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, if you're going to oppose this as
well, then you stay out of this, too!</font>

600
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:30,757
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know what's going on.</font>

601
00:45:30,782 --> 00:45:32,438
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean I don't?</font>

602
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,022
<font color=#FFFF00>I know everything, too!</font>

603
00:45:34,663 --> 00:45:39,022
<font color=#FFFF00>I know Jang-go's mother criticized
Mi-poong and hated her a lot.</font>

604
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:44,257
<font color=#FFFF00>But the one who criticized Mi-poong
was Jang-go's mother, not Jang-go.</font>

605
00:45:45,234 --> 00:45:46,788
<font color=#FFFF00>So why are being like that to him?</font>

606
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. Dae-hoon-</font>

607
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:51,569
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not finished yet!</font>

608
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,865
<font color=#FFFF00>In my opinion, Jang-go did nothing wrong.</font>

609
00:45:57,273 --> 00:45:59,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, I heard Jang-go
helped you and Mi-poong</font>

610
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:02,078
<font color=#FFFF00>out a lot when you were having a hard time.</font>

611
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,358
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't be like that.</font>

612
00:46:04,757 --> 00:46:07,311
<font color=#FFFF00>If you received help, you should
know how to return the favor.</font>

613
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:11,719
<font color=#FFFF00>The worst people in this world are the
ones who don't know how to be grateful!</font>

614
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:14,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, am I wrong?</font>

615
00:46:15,062 --> 00:46:18,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, you are right, but...</font>

616
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not wrong.</font>

617
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,561
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong, listen to me carefully.</font>

618
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:30,973
<font color=#FFFF00>I shall give you permission to date Jang-go!</font>

619
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:45,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Um... dad?</font>

620
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:50,421
<font color=#FFFF00>I think mom is very angry. What will you do?</font>

621
00:46:51,327 --> 00:46:54,507
<font color=#FFFF00>Dae-hoon, you're in big trouble now.</font>

622
00:46:55,835 --> 00:46:57,889
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't say anything wrong!</font>

623
00:46:59,171 --> 00:47:01,772
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't you worry about such a thing!</font>

624
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:19,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

625
00:47:22,303 --> 00:47:25,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, are you really mad at me?</font>

626
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:28,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about it.</font>

627
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,999
<font color=#FFFF00>What if my father was against
us, and we had to break up?</font>

628
00:47:35,906 --> 00:47:37,507
<font color=#FFFF00>How would you feel?</font>

629
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate it when Mi-poong is sad.</font>

630
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:49,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I want her to be very happy.</font>

631
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:57,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, how could you yell at me and
make me into an ungrateful person?</font>

632
00:47:58,663 --> 00:47:59,889
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, honey.</font>

633
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:02,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't mean it like that.</font>

634
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:11,579
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead, take this, and
don't be mad anymore.</font>

635
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,640
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

636
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,780
<font color=#FFFF00>A gift for you.</font>

637
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:20,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt bad for going to the amusement
park without you, so I bought it for you.</font>

638
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:25,702
<font color=#FFFF00>So take this, and please
don't be mad anymore. Okay?</font>

639
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:40,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

640
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:44,669
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you laugh right now? You could
have knocked me down with a feather!</font>

641
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, are you okay?</font>

642
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:56,733
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have gotten punished
for having done wrong to you.</font>

643
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:04,513
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, I'll listen to you from now on,</font>

644
00:49:05,247 --> 00:49:07,450
<font color=#FFFF00>so don't be angry anymore, okay?</font>

645
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,630
<font color=#FFFF00>You smiled.</font>

646
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:18,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you smiled, you're going to give
permission to Mi-poong, aren't you?</font>

647
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:24,419
<font color=#FFFF00>- I don't know.
- Thank you, honey.</font>

648
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:31,177
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Jang-soo. What about mother?</font>

649
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:37,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I searched the saunas and even called her
friends, but no one knows where she is!</font>

650
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:41,632
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll search for her, too, so the one who
finds her first should contact the other.</font>

651
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:04,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

652
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go.</font>

653
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:13,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how worried I was?</font>

654
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:17,864
<font color=#FFFF00>It's late. Let's go back together.</font>

655
00:50:19,348 --> 00:50:20,684
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Jang-go...</font>

656
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:26,208
<font color=#FFFF00>for coming to find a terrible mom like
me and offering to go back home with me.</font>

657
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you say that?</font>

658
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:32,137
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm your child. Your son.</font>

659
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:36,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't go.</font>

660
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:38,349
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

661
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:42,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how you feel, so
let's go back together.</font>

662
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:49,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I know very well that you'll understand
and forgive me since you're my son.</font>

663
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:52,411
<font color=#FFFF00>However,</font>

664
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:59,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't forgive myself.</font>

665
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:05,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I've done something horrible
to you and Mi-poong.</font>

666
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:09,216
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go,</font>

667
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:14,622
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel too guilty right
now to go back with you.</font>

668
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,817
<font color=#FFFF00>When I get the courage to go back...</font>

669
00:51:19,224 --> 00:51:23,395
<font color=#FFFF00>When I get the courage to
smile and meet you again...</font>

670
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:25,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back then.</font>

671
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:28,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you understand me?</font>

672
00:51:31,177 --> 00:51:32,177
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

673
00:51:34,388 --> 00:51:35,520
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll come back, won't you?</font>

674
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:40,637
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jang-go.</font>

675
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Jang-go.</font>

676
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:48,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

677
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:58,161
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</font>

678
00:52:20,192 --> 00:52:21,192
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong!</font>

679
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go!</font>

680
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:28,730
<font color=#FFFF00>My grandfather and mom
allowed us to be together.</font>

681
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:32,743
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really?
- Yes, my father solved everything.</font>

682
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you already know about it?</font>

683
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

684
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:46,613
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

685
00:52:53,176 --> 00:52:54,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you remember this?</font>

686
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:57,964
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course!</font>

687
00:52:58,863 --> 00:53:02,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go, that music room
legend must be true.</font>

688
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,433
<font color=#FFFF00>You still didn't find it yet?</font>

689
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:11,207
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the rush? We have plenty of
time, so I'm going to take my time.</font>

690
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:15,285
<font color=#FFFF00>But Kim Seung-hee, be honest.</font>

691
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:18,691
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't come here to
find something, did you?</font>

692
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,777
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come here to check the legend?</font>

693
00:53:23,879 --> 00:53:26,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, the thing is...</font>

694
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,007
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to check if we were
destined to be together or not.</font>

695
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:33,722
<font color=#FFFF00>I had my doubts, but I was right?</font>

696
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:56,473
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi-poong,</font>

697
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:00,691
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I would never
be able to see you again.</font>

698
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:05,168
<font color=#FFFF00>But when I saw you in Seoul again,</font>

699
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:07,825
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt it then.</font>

700
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,554
<font color=#FFFF00>We were destined to get
married from the beginning.</font>

701
00:54:14,324 --> 00:54:15,324
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang-go...</font>

702
00:54:36,918 --> 00:54:37,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Shin-ae!</font>

703
00:54:39,356 --> 00:54:42,816
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ju-no!
- Shin-ae, I brought my grandmother with me.</font>

704
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,957
<font color=#FFFF00>I brought my grandfather with me.</font>

705
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:46,801
<font color=#FFFF00>Where?</font>

706
00:54:47,715 --> 00:54:48,715
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather!</font>

707
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:50,895
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother!</font>

708
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,386
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jung-hee? Are you Jung-hee?
- Yes!</font>

709
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:06,214
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jung-hee!
- Honey!</font>

710
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:07,613
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

711
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:27,132
<font color=#FFFF00>- (Seoul Bumpkin, Pyeongyang Delinquent)
- In the end, they met.</font>

712
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:33,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Those elders were husband and wife in North
Korea. Does that mean you guys break up?</font>

713
00:55:34,426 --> 00:55:36,769
<font color=#FFFF00>No. My character was adopted, remember?</font>

714
00:55:37,496 --> 00:55:39,722
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not her real grandson,
so it's all right.</font>

715
00:55:40,426 --> 00:55:43,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? How fortunate.</font>

716
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:48,379
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's so sad. Did they
meet after 65 years?</font>

717
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,621
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What's the point
of North Korean families</font>

718
00:55:52,027 --> 00:55:55,964
<font color=#FFFF00>reuniting in dramas? They
should reunite in real lie.</font>

719
00:55:56,184 --> 00:56:01,542
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's true.
- What are our politicians doing
not solving such a matter?</font>

720
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:05,072
<font color=#FFFF00>If they're living off of taxes,
they should at least do such a thing.</font>

721
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:10,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone must self-reflect.</font>

722
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:16,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it make sense that families
can't meet each other for 65 years?</font>

723
00:56:16,527 --> 00:56:21,832
<font color=#FFFF00>- It doesn't make sense at all!
- At least they reunited in the drama.</font>

724
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:27,386
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mom really wanted
to see you appear on TV.</font>

725
00:56:28,527 --> 00:56:30,136
<font color=#FFFF00>Can she watch TV in the temple, too?</font>

726
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:38,943
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye-sung must be cold.
- Yes, it's because he's cold.</font>

727
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:42,386
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go see your grandma, Hye-sung.</font>

728
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:44,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye-sung, what's that?</font>

729
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:45,566
<font color=#FFFF00>Venerable sir.</font>

730
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:48,793
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello.
- Welcome.</font>

731
00:56:49,184 --> 00:56:50,621
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's my mother-in-law?</font>

732
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother!</font>

733
00:56:57,457 --> 00:56:58,524
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you're here?</font>

734
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,724
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Hello.</font>

735
00:57:01,606 --> 00:57:04,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you pick some vegetables?
Do they come out already?</font>

736
00:57:04,926 --> 00:57:08,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I was going to send some to you, but
you can take them while you're here.</font>

737
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

738
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,597
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

739
00:57:12,926 --> 00:57:15,050
<font color=#FFFF00>We just wanted to see you.</font>

740
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,574
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go back with us today.</font>

741
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:21,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, dear. You came here for vain again.</font>

742
00:57:21,723 --> 00:57:23,355
<font color=#FFFF00>I like being here.</font>

743
00:57:24,168 --> 00:57:25,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel comfortable here.</font>

744
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:30,043
<font color=#FFFF00>- We feel sorry.
- There's no need to be sorry.</font>

745
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,316
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Jang-go and Hye-sung?</font>

746
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:36,933
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom!
- Jang-go!</font>

747
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:41,152
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my adorable puppy!</font>

748
00:57:41,177 --> 00:57:45,168
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go to grandma.
- Oh, my! You grew a lot!</font>

749
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:48,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you crying? Didn't you miss me?</font>

750
00:57:57,301 --> 00:58:00,824
<font color=#FFFF00>I put money and Yoo-jin's photos in there.</font>

751
00:58:02,426 --> 00:58:03,738
<font color=#FFFF00>Buy something good to eat.</font>

752
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:10,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Yoo-jin doing well?</font>

753
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:12,504
<font color=#FFFF00>She's doing well.</font>

754
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:17,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now, she's in Cambodia
building houses for the needy.</font>

755
00:58:18,324 --> 00:58:21,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong is smiling a lot, too, nowadays.</font>

756
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:29,449
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, don't come here anymore.</font>

757
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:42,324
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come again, Shin-ae.</font>

758
00:58:56,871 --> 00:59:00,776
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee-dong lost a lot of weight.</font>

759
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:04,714
<font color=#FFFF00>He's building houses for the
needy in Cambodia right now.</font>

760
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:05,895
<font color=#FFFF00>Crazy fool.</font>

761
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:10,357
<font color=#FFFF00>He should be thinking about
coming back, getting re-married,</font>

762
00:59:10,382 --> 00:59:13,130
<font color=#FFFF00>having kids, and living
happily ever after with them.</font>

763
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,369
<font color=#FFFF00>He's raising someone
else's kid while building</font>

764
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:19,176
<font color=#FFFF00>homes for someone else in
someone else's country.</font>

765
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:24,027
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I eat to give
birth to a fool like him?</font>

766
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:28,308
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, don't you realize
why Hee-dong is doing this?</font>

767
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:33,670
<font color=#FFFF00>He's paying for our sins instead of us.</font>

768
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:34,808
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

769
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does my son have to pay
for your sins instead?</font>

770
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:42,738
<font color=#FFFF00>If he hadn't met you, why
would he be living like this?</font>

771
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:47,697
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all your fault! My life
is ruined because of you!</font>

772
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:49,560
<font color=#FFFF00>My son's life is ruined because of you, too!</font>

773
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:52,918
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all your fault! Your fault!</font>

774
00:59:53,512 --> 00:59:57,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Guard! Guard! Guard!</font>

775
00:59:58,285 --> 00:59:59,285
<font color=#FFFF00>What now?</font>

776
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me go to a different room!</font>

777
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,839
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I'm going to die if I'm with her!</font>

778
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:06,021
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't live with her!</font>

779
01:00:06,496 --> 01:00:08,839
<font color=#FFFF00>Inmate 4949, last time we
moved you to a different</font>

780
01:00:08,864 --> 01:00:10,815
<font color=#FFFF00>room, but you begged us to take you back to</font>

781
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,840
<font color=#FFFF00>this room because you couldn't live without</font>

782
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:15,046
<font color=#FFFF00>inmate 3894, so you had
gone on a hunger strike.</font>

783
01:00:15,277 --> 01:00:17,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I take it back! Let me use a different room!</font>

784
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:21,145
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't live with that wench!
- Let her change.</font>

785
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,309
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and change rooms.</font>

786
01:00:26,035 --> 01:00:28,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out! Get out! Get out!</font>

787
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,011
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out! Take your shoes!
- You get out!</font>

788
01:00:48,934 --> 01:00:51,267
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll carry it, honey.
- Thank you.</font>

789
01:01:04,737 --> 01:01:06,418
<font color=#FFFF00>(Happy Birthday)</font>

790
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:16,933
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim, we're here!</font>

791
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:21,230
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hi, Dal-ho!
- Hi!</font>

792
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:22,598
<font color=#FFFF00>You came?</font>

793
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,973
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have you been well, Young-ae?
- Yes.</font>

794
01:01:26,574 --> 01:01:29,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Young-ae, I brought griddle
pancakes and glass noodles.</font>

795
01:01:29,404 --> 01:01:31,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you didn't have to!</font>

796
01:01:37,106 --> 01:01:42,596
<font color=#FFFF00>"Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.</font>

797
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:48,461
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday to grandpa.
Happy birthday to you!"</font>

798
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday! Be healthy!</font>

799
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:13,426
<font color=#FFFF00>(Let's definitely meet
when the countries unite!)</font>

800
01:02:38,433 --> 01:02:39,816
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeong-cheol!</font>

801
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:43,136
<font color=#FFFF00>My son Yeong-cheol!</font>

802
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,230
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go to see you!</font>

803
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go to you!</font>

804
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,144
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure to go, Yeong-cheol!</font>

805
01:02:58,754 --> 01:02:59,996
<font color=#FFFF00>Soon-ok.</font>

806
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:02,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeong-cheol.</font>

807
01:03:03,676 --> 01:03:04,676
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come soon.</font>

808
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:07,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Just wait a little bit longer.</font>

809
01:03:46,194 --> 01:03:48,725
<font color=#FFFF00>(Thank you for watching "Blow Breeze."</font>

810
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:51,074
<font color=#FFFF00>We hope a wonderful breeze
will be blown in the world.)</font>
