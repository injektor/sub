00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,897
<font color="yellow">Doctor, what's wrong with
my daughter? She's okay, isn't she?</font>

4
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:25,577
<font color="yellow">You said her exam results were fine.</font>

5
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:31,304
<font color="yellow">As I said before, her MRI test and
electromyography results came out fine.</font>

6
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:36,093
<font color="yellow">Due to the accident, she seems to
be suffering from spinal cord injury.</font>

7
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:44,339
<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait and see, but she
may be paralyzed from the waist down.</font>

8
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,122
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she might
be paralyzed from the waist down?</font>

9
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:50,439
<font color="yellow">Do you mean she won't
be able to walk again?</font>

10
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,890
<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait and see.</font>

11
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:13,104
<font color="yellow">- Geum-sil, that way.
- What on earth is going on?</font>

12
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:23,992
<font color="yellow">If my daughter's life ends, so will yours.</font>

13
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,234
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get away with this.</font>

14
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:42,882
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, what happened?</font>

15
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:46,728
<font color="yellow">What do you mean Ha-yeon got
into an accident because of you?</font>

16
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,695
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, say something!</font>

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

18
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,252
<font color="yellow">What do we do about Ha-yeon?</font>

19
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:17,632
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

20
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:23,273
<font color="yellow">You were fine when you were at my house
a few hours ago! Why are you like this now?</font>

21
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,117
<font color="yellow">- My legs...
- Geum-sil.</font>

22
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,906
<font color="yellow">My legs won't move.</font>

23
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,274
<font color="yellow">I can't feel anything!</font>

24
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:37,136
<font color="yellow">Mother, what do I do?</font>

25
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,960
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, don't cry.</font>

26
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:45,047
<font color="yellow">It's times like this you need to get your
head on straight and conserve your energy.</font>

27
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,397
<font color="yellow">Mother, how will I live now?</font>

28
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:52,178
<font color="yellow">It would be better to die rather
than to lie down like this all my life.</font>

29
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:57,601
<font color="yellow">I can't feel anything. I can't walk.
So what's the point of living?</font>

30
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:05,960
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, you will get better.
You will be able to walk.</font>

31
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,058
<font color="yellow">You will be all right!</font>

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,279
<font color="yellow">That's right, Ha-yeon.
You just have to get treatment.</font>

33
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,726
<font color="yellow">You'll be fine.</font>

34
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,140
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, get out. Get out!</font>

35
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,917
<font color="yellow">I don't want to show
this side of myself to you.</font>

36
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,382
<font color="yellow">I said get out!</font>

37
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:26,968
<font color="yellow">Yes, Jang-go. Go outside.</font>

38
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,748
<font color="yellow">He's not answering his phone.</font>

39
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:53,692
<font color="yellow">He's not home yet.</font>

40
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,234
<font color="yellow">Perhaps...</font>

41
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,070
<font color="yellow">No. Nothing happened.</font>

42
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:05,453
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, I came home right now.</font>

43
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,812
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

44
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:10,223
<font color="yellow">I can't get in touch with you.</font>

45
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:14,331
<font color="yellow">Are you still with Jang Ha-yeon right now?</font>

46
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,601
<font color="yellow">Call me as soon as you get this message.</font>

47
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,986
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

48
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,242
<font color="yellow">Here. Have some hot ginger tea.</font>

49
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:38,742
<font color="yellow">Thanks, mom.</font>

50
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,180
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this ring?</font>

51
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:49,000
<font color="yellow">Did you get this from Jang-go?</font>

52
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:55,223
<font color="yellow">Mom, Jang-go proposed to me.</font>

53
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,726
<font color="yellow">I promised to marry him.</font>

54
00:04:58,695 --> 00:04:59,695
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

55
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,930
<font color="yellow">Marry?</font>

56
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:08,539
<font color="yellow">His family is against you!
Do you think you can still marry him?</font>

57
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:12,815
<font color="yellow">Did you forget how his mother treated you?</font>

58
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,644
<font color="yellow">Give that ring back to Jang-go immediately!</font>

59
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:20,614
<font color="yellow">Mom, even though it'll be tiring
for me, I want to marry him.</font>

60
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:23,812
<font color="yellow">Jang-go said he would get permission.</font>

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
<font color="yellow">Permission?</font>

62
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:27,431
<font color="yellow">Do you think that'll happen?</font>

63
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:30,591
<font color="yellow">His family will never be able
to give up on Ha-yeon.</font>

64
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:34,787
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, get a hold of yourself! In the end,</font>

65
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:38,164
<font color="yellow">Jang-go will do what his mom wants him to do!</font>

66
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,322
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

67
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,130
<font color="yellow">I trust Jang-go.</font>

68
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:51,936
<font color="yellow">Even when I'm holding your hand,
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or not.</font>

69
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,680
<font color="yellow">Tell me about your grandmother.</font>

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,080
<font color="yellow">About my grandmother?</font>

71
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:06,937
<font color="yellow">Did she ever talk about me?</font>

72
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:12,635
<font color="yellow">I only saw Seung-hee's grandmother
once when I was little. What do I do?</font>

73
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,671
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Does your head hurt again?</font>

74
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:27,881
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. It's bearable.</font>

75
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,783
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you go to the hospital?</font>

76
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:33,304
<font color="yellow">When I think about the times before I escaped,</font>

77
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,160
<font color="yellow">my head hurts, and I get dizzy and nauseous.</font>

78
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,015
<font color="yellow">When you escaped?</font>

79
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:43,007
<font color="yellow">We arrived safely at Amnok River.</font>

80
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:48,045
<font color="yellow">All we had to do was cross that river...</font>

81
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,803
<font color="yellow">but we got caught by the border guards.</font>

82
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:56,490
<font color="yellow">Bullets rained down on us.</font>

83
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,155
<font color="yellow">When I came to my senses again,
my dad, mom, and brother were all dead.</font>

84
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:07,410
<font color="yellow">After that, I don't remember
how I crossed the river by myself.</font>

85
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:12,861
<font color="yellow">Since then, I can't remember the past.</font>

86
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:17,481
<font color="yellow">You lost your family right
in front of your eyes.</font>

87
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,811
<font color="yellow">So how can your mind be sound?</font>

88
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,209
<font color="yellow">My poor baby.</font>

89
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:25,842
<font color="yellow">Grandfather.</font>

90
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:34,670
<font color="yellow">I think I was alive all this time
so that I can meet you.</font>

91
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:41,874
<font color="yellow">So, sweetheart, from now on,
don't worry about anything, okay?</font>

92
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,210
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

93
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:52,727
<font color="yellow">The only evidence he has is that ring,
but it's like he found</font>

94
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,132
<font color="yellow">his biological granddaughter already!
What's wrong with him?</font>

95
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,507
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

96
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:02,032
<font color="yellow">What is he going to do if they do a DNA
test and she's not his granddaughter?</font>

97
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,056
<font color="yellow">I know!</font>

98
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,585
<font color="yellow">But mom, if she really is
his biological granddaughter,</font>

99
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,813
<font color="yellow">then what happens with her and Hee-dong?</font>

100
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,140
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what is going on!</font>

101
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:18,397
<font color="yellow">If that's true, then don't
they need to get divorced?</font>

102
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:24,768
<font color="yellow">Cousins up to three times removed
can't get married to each other.</font>

103
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:28,235
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae and Hee-dong are exactly
cousins three times removed!</font>

104
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,475
<font color="yellow">Mom, is that true?</font>

105
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,624
<font color="yellow">Yes! That's what our country law states!</font>

106
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,540
<font color="yellow">Mom, aside from everything else,
what do we do about Hee-dong?</font>

107
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,686
<font color="yellow">Poor Hee-dong!</font>

108
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:52,717
<font color="yellow">How can you believe that she is father's
granddaughter with just one ring?</font>

109
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:55,624
<font color="yellow">There's DNA testing.</font>

110
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,764
<font color="yellow">Did you contact Hee-dong?</font>

111
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,686
<font color="yellow">Yes. He'll be coming back today.</font>

112
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,116
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Hee-dong.</font>

113
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:29,702
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to him when he comes.</font>

114
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:34,319
<font color="yellow">When he comes, I'll tell him myself.</font>

115
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:35,749
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

116
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,117
<font color="yellow">It might be better for you to tell him.</font>

117
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:43,749
<font color="yellow">But father, when are you
going to do a DNA test?</font>

118
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:45,452
<font color="yellow">DNA test?</font>

119
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:49,799
<font color="yellow">You know, the test that lets you
find out if you're truly related</font>

120
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:53,436
<font color="yellow">to each other or not by using
things like hair and nails.</font>

121
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:58,738
<font color="yellow">Yes, father. That would
be the most efficient way.</font>

122
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,043
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

123
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,824
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she's my granddaughter,
so why would I do a test?</font>

124
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,902
<font color="yellow">What can be better proof than the ring?</font>

125
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:12,191
<font color="yellow">No, grandfather. Let's do the test.
I'll feel more comfortable that way.</font>

126
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:17,176
<font color="yellow">Yes, Elder, I think that would be best.</font>

127
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,144
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's do that, grandfather.</font>

128
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,488
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

129
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:25,301
<font color="yellow">If it's what you want, we'll do it.</font>

130
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,095
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's do that.</font>

131
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,444
<font color="yellow">Grandfathers and their
granddaughters can't be checked</font>

132
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,340
<font color="yellow">if they're biologically related to each other?</font>

133
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,365
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

134
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:49,037
<font color="yellow">In this case, Shin-ae's father
would need to come</font>

135
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,937
<font color="yellow">and be tested to check if
he's related to Mr. Kim,</font>

136
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:53,010
<font color="yellow">and then we can
connect their relationships</font>

137
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,161
<font color="yellow">to check if Shin-ae and Mr. Kim are related.</font>

138
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:59,764
<font color="yellow">But with just these two people,
we can't prove if they're related or not.</font>

139
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,183
<font color="yellow">My father can't come here.</font>

140
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,238
<font color="yellow">He passed away.</font>

141
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,715
<font color="yellow">This doesn't make any sense!</font>

142
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:13,415
<font color="yellow">What do you mean their relationship
can't be determined if her father isn't here?</font>

143
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,165
<font color="yellow">Please do something about this!</font>

144
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,918
<font color="yellow">As I have just explained, it isn't possible.</font>

145
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,473
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, let's go.</font>

146
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,496
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

147
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:41,085
<font color="yellow">Honey, this is ridiculous!</font>

148
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,381
<font color="yellow">How can a grandfather and his
granddaughter not be able to be checked?</font>

149
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:48,025
<font color="yellow">Even if they can't prove their
relationship through DNA testing,</font>

150
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,356
<font color="yellow">is father still going to
accept her as his granddaughter?</font>

151
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:51,449
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

152
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:53,426
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

153
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,566
<font color="yellow">That's up to Elder to decide.</font>

154
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,301
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous!</font>

155
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,802
<font color="yellow">Why can't I get in touch with him?</font>

156
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,625
<font color="yellow">Something must have happened.</font>

157
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,957
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll just look around!</font>

158
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:23,982
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

159
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,285
<font color="yellow">Are you talking to us?</font>

160
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,661
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

161
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:35,113
<font color="yellow">I can't get in touch with Jang-go. I was
wondering if something happened to him.</font>

162
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:39,355
<font color="yellow">Did Jang-go call home last night?</font>

163
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,589
<font color="yellow">- The thing is...
- Jang-soo, stay quiet.</font>

164
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,621
<font color="yellow">How is that any of your business?</font>

165
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,137
<font color="yellow">You have nothing to do with Jang-go.</font>

166
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:52,969
<font color="yellow">And don't come into our yard.</font>

167
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,268
<font color="yellow">I'll get in trouble if
my mother-in-law finds out!</font>

168
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,848
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra, come on.
- Did I say something wrong?</font>

169
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:03,936
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? Are you two fighting?
- Grandmother! No, we're not!</font>

170
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,308
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

171
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:13,265
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you contact us?
How is Ha-yeon doing?</font>

172
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:14,661
<font color="yellow">Is she okay?</font>

173
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:16,340
<font color="yellow">No, she's not.</font>

174
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:21,471
<font color="yellow">Poor Ha-yeon. She may
never be able to walk again.</font>

175
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,215
<font color="yellow">What? Is that true?</font>

176
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:27,362
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What is going on?
Why did she have to</font>

177
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,916
<font color="yellow">get into an accident
right in front of Jang-go?</font>

178
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,565
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

179
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,668
<font color="yellow">Which hospital is she at? I'll go visit her.</font>

180
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:34,832
<font color="yellow">Hatsal Hospital.</font>

181
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,691
<font color="yellow">But mom, it's better
if you don't go right now.</font>

182
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:42,282
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon and Geum-sil
were crying all night long.</font>

183
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,801
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is out of it, too.</font>

184
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,879
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What is going on? What do we do?</font>

185
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:53,872
<font color="yellow">Go in. It's cold.</font>

186
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:55,481
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

187
00:13:56,801 --> 00:14:00,118
<font color="yellow">All of you must be shocked and in disbelief</font>

188
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:03,835
<font color="yellow">because Shin-ae suddenly
became my granddaughter.</font>

189
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:10,730
<font color="yellow">However, if you doubt her as my real
granddaughter and hurt her again,</font>

190
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:13,449
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive you.</font>

191
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,348
<font color="yellow">Do you understand, Chung-ja?</font>

192
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,973
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

193
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,676
<font color="yellow">And Dal-ho...</font>

194
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:26,426
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

195
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:32,028
<font color="yellow">Now that Shin-ae is my granddaughter
and your daughter-in-law,</font>

196
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:38,558
<font color="yellow">wouldn't it be better for you
and me to become in-laws?</font>

197
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:41,443
<font color="yellow">Of course, Elder...</font>

198
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,114
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

199
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:44,668
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

200
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:52,207
<font color="yellow">I'll explain this matter to Hee-dong well,
so don't worry about anything.</font>

201
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:56,926
<font color="yellow">What does he mean he wants to be in-laws?</font>

202
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:01,723
<font color="yellow">And why is Dal-ho calling him Mr. Kim
like we're complete strangers?</font>

203
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:11,066
<font color="yellow">Come on! My arm is about to pop out!</font>

204
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,988
<font color="yellow">Why are you so strong?</font>

205
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,223
<font color="yellow">Your arm is not the problem right now!</font>

206
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,737
<font color="yellow">What does he mean he wants to become in-laws?</font>

207
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:24,597
<font color="yellow">It's like he wants to become strangers
with us! And yet, you say okay?</font>

208
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,780
<font color="yellow">You should've said no!</font>

209
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:31,160
<font color="yellow">How can relatives become in-laws?
Do you think that makes any sense?</font>

210
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,246
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

211
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:37,338
<font color="yellow">And can we become in-laws just
because he wants to be in-laws?</font>

212
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:40,738
<font color="yellow">Even though his word is law in this house,</font>

213
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:45,261
<font color="yellow">there's something called the
Family Registration Act! This is impossible!</font>

214
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,668
<font color="yellow">Honey, calm down and listen to me.</font>

215
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:53,269
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I was going to tell you
last night, but I thought it would be</font>

216
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:57,528
<font color="yellow">best if I told this to you when
Hee-dong was here, so I didn't tell you.</font>

217
00:15:57,553 --> 00:16:00,933
<font color="yellow">No! I'm not going to
be in-laws with him!</font>

218
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:04,896
<font color="yellow">I'll make those two divorce if I have to!
I'll never become his in-law!</font>

219
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:07,739
<font color="yellow">To be honest, in-laws are
complete strangers. We need to be</font>

220
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:10,628
<font color="yellow">distant relatives so that we can
have the right of inheritance.</font>

221
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,238
<font color="yellow">But you want us to give that up?</font>

222
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,578
<font color="yellow">Distant relatives, my foot!
Right of inheritance, my foot!</font>

223
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:18,160
<font color="yellow">We're not related to Mr. Kim by blood at all!</font>

224
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,069
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

225
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,580
<font color="yellow">You keep calling him Mr. Kim!</font>

226
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,340
<font color="yellow">Because we're not related at all!</font>

227
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,316
<font color="yellow">We're not related at all?
How can we not be related at all?</font>

228
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:37,293
<font color="yellow">He's cousins with your late father!</font>

229
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:38,551
<font color="yellow">He's not!</font>

230
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:40,012
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

231
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:42,746
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

232
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,980
<font color="yellow">he was adopted.</font>

233
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,263
<font color="yellow">He's not my grandfather's biological son.</font>

234
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:52,714
<font color="yellow">That's why we're not distant relatives at all.</font>

235
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:54,965
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

236
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,855
<font color="yellow">Your father was adopted?</font>

237
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:04,181
<font color="yellow">That's why I was telling you
not to be greedy all this time.</font>

238
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:07,033
<font color="yellow">We should just be grateful
he treated us like his relatives!</font>

239
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:10,407
<font color="yellow">Don't even think of getting one bean from him!</font>

240
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:13,902
<font color="yellow">Now do you understand
why I couldn't tell you the truth?</font>

241
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,671
<font color="yellow">We were complete strangers?</font>

242
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,196
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

243
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,121
<font color="yellow">We're living off of our in-laws?</font>

244
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,231
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong is living in his wife's home?</font>

245
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:44,324
<font color="yellow">If Shin-ae decides to divorce Hee-dong...</font>

246
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:52,699
<font color="yellow">we'll become beggars.</font>

247
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,599
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang, you shouldn't do this!
Please calm down!</font>

248
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:38,496
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! I don't have
a reason to live anymore!</font>

249
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:43,207
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to suffer through this?
What did I do so wrong?</font>

250
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,824
<font color="yellow">- Please stop her!
- I hate this!</font>

251
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,840
<font color="yellow">- I hate this!
- Ha-yeon!</font>

252
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,153
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

253
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:57,353
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

254
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:01,566
<font color="yellow">Can't you return my legs to
the way they were before?</font>

255
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:43,087
<font color="yellow">You got a lot of nerves
showing up your face here.</font>

256
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,579
<font color="yellow">Do you know what happened because of you?</font>

257
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:52,159
<font color="yellow">Jang-go and Ha-yeon's bright
future is ruined because of you!</font>

258
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:56,038
<font color="yellow">- Mother.
- Oh, I see how it is. Did you come to see how</font>

259
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:59,216
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon is after she got into
an accident because of you?</font>

260
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,090
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

261
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:05,964
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here. You should
go and see what you just caused!</font>

262
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:10,180
<font color="yellow">Let's go see poor Ha-yeon who
became half-paralyzed because of you!</font>

263
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:13,551
<font color="yellow">- Let's go see her!
- Mother, it's not that!</font>

264
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:14,801
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

265
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:19,965
<font color="yellow">That's why you should have
broken up with him when I told you to!</font>

266
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:26,504
<font color="yellow">Why are you sticking to my son like
a leech and creating all this chaos?</font>

267
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:29,832
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for you,
they would've been in</font>

268
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:33,037
<font color="yellow">England by now, and none
of this would've happened.</font>

269
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:36,953
<font color="yellow">This is all because of
your greed! It's all your fault!</font>

270
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,324
<font color="yellow">You horrible wench!</font>

271
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:58,975
<font color="yellow"><i>How much more of this
frozen time has to pass by?</i></font>

272
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:06,716
<font color="yellow"><i>In your arms, in my heart</i></font>

273
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:13,756
<font color="yellow"><i>You used to live</i></font>

274
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:21,197
<font color="yellow"><i>I loved and wanted you</i></font>

275
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:27,737
<font color="yellow"><i>Because I live inside your memories</i></font>

276
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:35,411
<font color="yellow"><i>In the memory that spreads inside of me</i></font>

277
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:44,053
<font color="yellow"><i>You always protect my side</i></font>

278
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:49,425
<font color="yellow"><i>Forever</i></font>

279
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,379
<font color="yellow">Father, are you going somewhere with Shin-ae?</font>

280
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,536
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

281
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,559
<font color="yellow">But Chung-ja...</font>

282
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:03,981
<font color="yellow">Yes, father?</font>

283
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:06,535
<font color="yellow">You must have heard everything from Dal-ho.</font>

284
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,621
<font color="yellow">Now that we're in-laws,</font>

285
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,754
<font color="yellow">change the way you address me.</font>

286
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:13,595
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, father...</font>

287
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:16,384
<font color="yellow">I mean, Mr. Kim.</font>

288
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:17,989
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

289
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:22,808
<font color="yellow">Understand that this is all for
the best for Shin-ae and Hee-dong.</font>

290
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:24,917
<font color="yellow">From now on, be careful.</font>

291
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,746
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Yes, grandfather.</font>

292
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:32,332
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, mother.</font>

293
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,395
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

294
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,767
<font color="yellow">How can he tell you to
change the way you address</font>

295
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,590
<font color="yellow">him just because he found his granddaughter?</font>

296
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:42,848
<font color="yellow">How can he be so cold? Oh my god!</font>

297
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,762
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

298
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:00,098
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja.</font>

299
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,082
<font color="yellow">Get up and drink this.</font>

300
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:06,518
<font color="yellow">Here. This is honey water. Here, here.</font>

301
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:14,590
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You need to keep up your spirits.</font>

302
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:17,980
<font color="yellow">You don't know how that old man will change!</font>

303
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,105
<font color="yellow">What's the point of keeping up my spirits?</font>

304
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,035
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can do now.</font>

305
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:33,637
<font color="yellow">I can't believe my late
father-in-law was adopted!</font>

306
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:38,565
<font color="yellow">We're not distant relatives anymore!</font>

307
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,641
<font color="yellow">That's why Dal-ho should have grabbed the
chance to become Mr. Kim's adopted son!</font>

308
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,535
<font color="yellow">This problem wouldn't be happening then.</font>

309
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,324
<font color="yellow">I know!</font>

310
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:53,941
<font color="yellow">I hate Dal-ho more than father-
I mean, Mr. Kim!</font>

311
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:56,612
<font color="yellow">The fortune-teller was right!</font>

312
00:23:57,418 --> 00:24:02,409
<font color="yellow">I was making fruitless efforts all this time!</font>

313
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,492
<font color="yellow">Goodness. But would
he really chase you out after</font>

314
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:07,809
<font color="yellow">all these years you've been living together?</font>

315
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:14,665
<font color="yellow">Anyways, Hee-dong is the husband
of his one and only granddaughter!</font>

316
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:17,457
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

317
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:20,909
<font color="yellow">All you can do now is to be good to Mr. Kim so</font>

318
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:24,215
<font color="yellow">that Hee-dong and Shin-ae live well together.</font>

319
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:30,621
<font color="yellow">If they get a divorce, then you'll
really be holding onto false hope!</font>

320
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:33,168
<font color="yellow">So what now?</font>

321
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:36,590
<font color="yellow">I have to serve two people now.</font>

322
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:41,091
<font color="yellow">Now I have to serve my own daughter-in-law.</font>

323
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,817
<font color="yellow">Mom, how did I end up this way?</font>

324
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,480
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok.</font>

325
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:59,112
<font color="yellow">My son Dae-hoon whom I've never seen before.</font>

326
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:00,997
<font color="yellow">Are you watching?</font>

327
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:08,862
<font color="yellow">I met Kim Seung-hee- I mean Park Shin-ae.</font>

328
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:10,652
<font color="yellow">So don't worry.</font>

329
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:17,191
<font color="yellow">I'll live a long time so that I can
set up a good place for Shin-ae.</font>

330
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:22,082
<font color="yellow">Grandmother.</font>

331
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,043
<font color="yellow">Mom. Dad.</font>

332
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,801
<font color="yellow">I met grandfather.</font>

333
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:29,512
<font color="yellow">Don't worry anymore.</font>

334
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:06,037
<font color="yellow">I think he's completely
acknowledging me as his granddaughter now.</font>

335
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,823
<font color="yellow">Thanks to this lucky ring.</font>

336
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,590
<font color="yellow">- Look who it is.
- Mr. Kim!</font>

337
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,207
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

338
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,225
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time!</font>

339
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:36,254
<font color="yellow">But did you come here
because something awful happened?</font>

340
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:41,913
<font color="yellow">No! I took the bus and somehow ended up here.</font>

341
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:42,938
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

342
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:46,551
<font color="yellow">Did you come alone today, too?</font>

343
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:52,277
<font color="yellow">No. Today I came with my granddaughter.</font>

344
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:54,574
<font color="yellow">Oh, with your granddaughter?</font>

345
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,493
<font color="yellow">She went to the restroom right now.</font>

346
00:26:57,926 --> 00:27:02,178
<font color="yellow">When she comes back, let's go
to the coffee shop and drink coffee.</font>

347
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:06,808
<font color="yellow">Oh, no! You came with your granddaughter.
You can buy coffee for me next time.</font>

348
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:08,371
<font color="yellow">It's fine!</font>

349
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,410
<font color="yellow">- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.</font>

350
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:28,051
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Mi-poong? I mean, Seung-hee?</font>

351
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,816
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

352
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:34,035
<font color="yellow">How are my grandfather and Mi-poong together?</font>

353
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:36,941
<font color="yellow">How do they know each other?</font>

354
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:45,402
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong won't be able to
recognize grandfather's ring, right?</font>

355
00:27:59,473 --> 00:28:00,940
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Shin-ae?</font>

356
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:02,364
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

357
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,867
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, I don't feel well.</font>

358
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:10,441
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come.
I'll be inside the car first.</font>

359
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:13,043
<font color="yellow">You're not feeling well? Okay.</font>

360
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:21,865
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. My granddaughter is feeling sick.</font>

361
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,920
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you coffee next time.</font>

362
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:26,163
<font color="yellow">- Sure. Good-bye, Mr. Kim.
- Bye.</font>

363
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,582
<font color="yellow">- See you next time.
- Okay.</font>

364
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:39,793
<font color="yellow">Grandfather said "Shin-ae"
in front of Mi-poong.</font>

365
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,473
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have realized it was me, right?</font>

366
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:47,027
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, are you very sick?</font>

367
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,388
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the hospital right away.</font>

368
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,930
<font color="yellow">Where did my driver go?</font>

369
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:56,450
<font color="yellow">He went to the
convenience store to buy hot tea.</font>

370
00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:00,861
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Shin-ae. Where does it hurt?</font>

371
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:04,863
<font color="yellow">I was dizzy and shaking earlier,</font>

372
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:08,401
<font color="yellow">but I'm feeling better now that
I'm sitting in the car with the heater on.</font>

373
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:11,010
<font color="yellow">I think I didn't dress warmly enough.</font>

374
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,738
<font color="yellow">From now on, make sure you dress warmly.</font>

375
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, grandfather.</font>

376
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:19,004
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

377
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:24,230
<font color="yellow">I saw you talking with a woman earlier.</font>

378
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:25,895
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

379
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:30,191
<font color="yellow">I met her here coincidentally.</font>

380
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,147
<font color="yellow">While escaping like you, she lost her father</font>

381
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,488
<font color="yellow">and brother. I think she suffered quite a bit.</font>

382
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,512
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

383
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,519
<font color="yellow">I guess she doesn't have other family members.</font>

384
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,504
<font color="yellow">While we were talking, she did mention
she has a mom and another family member.</font>

385
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:53,161
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

386
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,490
<font color="yellow">I don't think he knows that Mi-poong
and Ms. Joo are in the same family.</font>

387
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:59,093
<font color="yellow">What can I do about this?</font>

388
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:03,808
<font color="yellow">I barely chased Ms. Joo out of the
restaurant, but he knows Mi-poong as well.</font>

389
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:07,715
<font color="yellow">Everything will be over
if she recognizes this ring.</font>

390
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,332
<font color="yellow">My ring fell.</font>

391
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,160
<font color="yellow">It always falls out like this
because it's too big.</font>

392
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,750
<font color="yellow">What if you lose it somewhere?</font>

393
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:35,243
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, now that our rings are together,
how about we save them in a frame?</font>

394
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:39,565
<font color="yellow">Then your ring and grandmother's
ring will always be together.</font>

395
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

396
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,240
<font color="yellow">I almost lost my ring several times, too.</font>

397
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:47,556
<font color="yellow">How did you come up
with such an incredible idea?</font>

398
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:50,775
<font color="yellow">Let's do that. That's a great idea.</font>

399
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:57,343
<font color="yellow">Now your ring and grandmother's
ring will never separate.</font>

400
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:58,368
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

401
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:08,699
<font color="yellow">Why? What's wrong?</font>

402
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:10,363
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

403
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,746
<font color="yellow">I want to hurry up and go home.</font>

404
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:18,605
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and drive!</font>

405
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,418
<font color="yellow">What shall we do?</font>

406
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,752
<font color="yellow">We can't do this or that.</font>

407

you couldn't get in touch with me, huh?</font>

415
00:32:58,004 --> 00:33:02,070
<font color="yellow">The truth is, Ha-yeon got into a
car accident when she was with me.</font>

416
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:05,793
<font color="yellow">That's why I couldn't contact you.</font>

417
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:12,114

an accident because of me.</font>

she wouldn't have become like this.</font>

420
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,309

phone call. I should've gone to see her</font>

421
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:28,248
<font color="yellow">even though you insisted on
going instead. I should've gone to see her.</font>

422
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,434

your fault. Don't think like that.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll call you often, so don't worry.</font>

443
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:11,418
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

444
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:53,742
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, they're so pretty.</font>

445
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:59,754
<font color="yellow">Now that they're together,</font>

446
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:05,319
<font color="yellow">it feels like I met your grandmother
again. I'm so touched.</font>

447
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,643
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, leave this here,
and look at it in the</font>

448
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:14,317
<font color="yellow">morning and evening,
like you're admiring artwork.</font>

449
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:20,261
<font color="yellow">What kind of artwork would make
my heart flutter more than this one?</font>

450
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:28,300
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, when I die,
put this frame into my coffin.</font>

451
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,137
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

452
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,857
<font color="yellow">You have to live with me
until you're 200 years old.</font>

453
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:40,972
<font color="yellow">All right. I will live a long time for you.</font>

454
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:46,309
<font color="yellow">Father- I mean, Mr. Kim. Here is ginger tea.</font>

455
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:47,879
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

456
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:50,575
<font color="yellow">Did you put a lot of honey in there?</font>

457
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:52,582
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

458
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:06,073
<font color="yellow">If you drink this and get a good
night's sleep, you'll feel much better.</font>

459
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,462
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and drink it.</font>

460
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:11,112
<font color="yellow">Good girl.</font>

461
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,277
<font color="yellow">Yes. More. Good.</font>

462
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:27,026
<font color="yellow">They went to Imjingak Pavilion by
themselves. What are they doing now?</font>

463
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:30,160
<font color="yellow">They're treating each other like
they're the apples of their eyes.</font>

464
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:33,189
<font color="yellow">Of course they would be doing that.
He's been searching for his</font>

465
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:36,029
<font color="yellow">blood relative his whole life,
and now he finally found her.</font>

466
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:40,163
<font color="yellow">But why doesn't she feel
like his granddaughter to me?</font>

467
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:42,230
<font color="yellow">She feels like an imposter.</font>

468
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:44,989
<font color="yellow">Goodness! He'll hear you!</font>

469
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:47,966
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be kicked out by her?</font>

470
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:52,050
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't dare!
I'm still her mother-in-law!</font>

471
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:56,599
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Now she's the
top-dog and we're the underdogs!</font>

472
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,886
<font color="yellow">From now on, you need to look
good to her in order to live here.</font>

473
00:38:03,488 --> 00:38:08,839
<font color="yellow">If Hee-dong says he'll divorce her,
I'm going to leave this house with him.</font>

474
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,357
<font color="yellow">Can you really do that?</font>

475
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:15,566
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

476
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:18,482
<font color="yellow">I can never leave this house.
It would be too unfair.</font>

477
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:22,983
<font color="yellow">I can't leave because of all the years
I dedicated my life to this house!</font>

478
00:38:23,957 --> 00:38:28,112
<font color="yellow">Anyways, how much did you tell Hee-dong?</font>

479
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,114
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho just told him that
we found the granddaughter.</font>

480
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:37,014
<font color="yellow">If Hee-dong finds out Shin-ae is
the granddaughter, he'll be so shocked.</font>

481
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,737
<font color="yellow">Still, they got married because
they love each other so much.</font>

482
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:50,292
<font color="yellow">Aside from everything else, I just
want those two to live a happy life now.</font>

483
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:02,457
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

484
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:22,753
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

485
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:28,988
<font color="yellow">What do you mean Shin-ae is the
granddaughter grandfather has been looking for?</font>

486
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:36,198
<font color="yellow">We found out on the day
we returned from China.</font>

487
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:42,006
<font color="yellow">The Kim Seung-hee he had
been looking for is Shin-ae.</font>

488
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,386
<font color="yellow">But Hee-dong,</font>

489
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:56,212
<font color="yellow">since your late grandfather isn't
really relatives with this grandfather,</font>

490
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,831
<font color="yellow">there are no problems.</font>

491
00:39:59,707 --> 00:40:05,128
<font color="yellow">So all you two have to do now is live happily.</font>

492
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:10,745
<font color="yellow">You two can't live without each other.
You two love each other.</font>

493
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,629
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae,what's going on?</font>

494
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:18,800
<font color="yellow">Even if they explain it to me,
I don't understand.</font>

495
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:20,722
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong...</font>

496
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:26,917
<font color="yellow">Then everything you told me
so far has been a lie?</font>

497
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,282
<font color="yellow">I did that because-</font>

498
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:33,636
<font color="yellow">She did that because she loves you so much!</font>

499
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,409
<font color="yellow">She really didn't want to lose you!</font>

500
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:39,636
<font color="yellow">I heard that, and my heart broke!</font>

501
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:42,850
<font color="yellow">She loved you so much that she had to do that!</font>

502
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:45,738
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

503
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,511
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

504
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:53,056
<font color="yellow">I need a moment to think.</font>

505
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:58,667
<font color="yellow">- Hee-dong! Hee-dong! Hee-dong!
- I'll go after him. I'll talk to him.</font>

506
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:00,853
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Hee-dong.</font>

507
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:04,597
<font color="yellow">What is going on? Oh my goodness. Hee-dong.</font>

508
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong!</font>

509
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,441
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong!</font>

510
00:41:16,527 --> 00:41:17,527
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

511
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:19,605
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

512
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:24,813
<font color="yellow">What are you going to lie about this time?</font>

513
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,956
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong...</font>

514
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:33,072
<font color="yellow">The fact that your hometown is Sokcho.</font>

515
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:36,244
<font color="yellow">The story about your parents
passing away in high school.</font>

516
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:39,011
<font color="yellow">The memories with your grandmother
who passed away two years ago.</font>

517
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,681
<font color="yellow">All those things you told me while
you were crying were nothing but lies.</font>

518
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:47,644
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

519
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:50,667
<font color="yellow">They're all lies.</font>

520
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:53,378
<font color="yellow">I made them up.</font>

521
00:41:57,527 --> 00:41:58,994
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

522
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:06,994
<font color="yellow">I don't know who you are.
It's like you're a different person.</font>

523
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:15,831
<font color="yellow">You have no idea how I lived in
Korea after escaping North Korea.</font>

524
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,370
<font color="yellow">People are smiling on the outside,</font>

525
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,258
<font color="yellow">but they actually disrespect me.</font>

526
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:25,682
<font color="yellow">I thought if I told you
I was from North Korea,</font>

527
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:29,527
<font color="yellow">you would be distant from me,
leave me, and not like me.</font>

528
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,494
<font color="yellow">That's why I did that.</font>

529
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:39,543
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

530
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:42,833
<font color="yellow">Not everyone is like that.</font>

531
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:45,941
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae,</font>

532
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,917
<font color="yellow">I would've liked you no matter who you were.</font>

533
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:58,417
<font color="yellow">My feelings towards
you would've never been shaken.</font>

534
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:07,628
<font color="yellow">I thought you would know my sincere feelings.</font>

535
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:13,558
<font color="yellow">I thought our sincerity connected,
so I don't know</font>

536
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,089
<font color="yellow">why you would need to
make up such lies between us.</font>

537
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,612
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, I'm sorry.</font>

538
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:26,581
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have lied for whatever reason.</font>

539
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:28,763
<font color="yellow">Forgive me, Hee-dong.</font>

540
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:33,175
<font color="yellow">I'm still so...</font>

541
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:38,825
<font color="yellow">Everything is so confusing.</font>

542
00:43:47,636 --> 00:43:51,073
<font color="yellow">He must have genuinely liked me...</font>

543
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:12,967
<font color="yellow"><i>As each day passes, I'm here in this place</i></font>

544
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:21,081
<font color="yellow">Since I lost my mom's ring, I feel like
all of my ties to her disappeared.</font>

545
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:27,255
<font color="yellow">You have me by your side now.</font>

546
00:44:30,347 --> 00:44:31,823
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Hee-dong.</font>

547
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,372
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, cheer up.</font>

548
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:40,183
<font color="yellow">All I have is you now.</font>

549
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:47,034
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, no matter what happens,
you'll never throw me away, right?</font>

550
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:52,874
<font color="yellow"><i>At least that way my heart will be at ease</i></font>

551
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:56,978
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll do as you want</i></font>

552
00:44:56,978 --> 00:45:01,182
<font color="yellow"><i>Thus, I may hurt more </i></font>

553
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:04,586
<font color="yellow"><i>I may have a harder time, who knows</i></font>

554
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:14,629
<font color="yellow"><i>If I do and you come to me, that's enough</i></font>

555
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:20,042
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he coming? I can't even call him.</font>

556
00:45:23,535 --> 00:45:24,535
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

557
00:45:25,214 --> 00:45:27,019
<font color="yellow">If he wants a divorce, I'll give it to him.</font>

558
00:45:27,831 --> 00:45:29,808
<font color="yellow">It's his loss if we get a divorce.</font>

559
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:32,871
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

560
00:45:33,738 --> 00:45:36,213
<font color="yellow">We got married even though
his mother was against us.</font>

561
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:40,472
<font color="yellow">If I divorce him so easily,
they'll doubt me for sure.</font>

562
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:47,479
<font color="yellow">Until I become grandfather's
legal granddaughter, I need him.</font>

563
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:49,870
<font color="yellow">I can't divorce him.</font>

564
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:54,043
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

565
00:45:57,574 --> 00:45:59,374
<font color="yellow">I was so worried about you.</font>

566
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,261
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

567
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:06,707
<font color="yellow">telling the truth right now?</font>

568
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:10,128
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

569
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:13,081
<font color="yellow">Did you really lie to me...</font>

570
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,355
<font color="yellow">because you love me?</font>

571
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,315
<font color="yellow">I thought you would leave me
if you knew the truth about me.</font>

572
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:29,597
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you, so...</font>

573
00:46:30,785 --> 00:46:32,597
<font color="yellow">I'm nothing.</font>

574
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:36,776
<font color="yellow">A cartoonist like me is nothing.</font>

575
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:43,121
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

576
00:46:45,144 --> 00:46:48,247
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not realizing
your feelings and lying to you.</font>

577
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:53,003
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

578
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:55,339
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

579
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,098
<font color="yellow">Lying is a hard thing to do.</font>

580
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,713
<font color="yellow">When I think of how hard
it must have been for you,</font>

581
00:47:05,683 --> 00:47:07,105
<font color="yellow">my heart hurts.</font>

582
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:09,519
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong...</font>

583
00:47:13,183 --> 00:47:15,269
<font color="yellow">Is there anything else you haven't told me?</font>

584
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:17,561
<font color="yellow">If there is, tell me now.</font>

585
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:21,433
<font color="yellow">No. There's nothing else.</font>

586
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:23,527
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

587
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,651
<font color="yellow">Really.</font>

588
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:31,488
<font color="yellow">Then it's fine.</font>

589
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,730
<font color="yellow">We're okay now.</font>

590
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,722
<font color="yellow">She got hurt that badly?</font>

591
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,144
<font color="yellow">Jang-go didn't say that,</font>

592
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:48,525
<font color="yellow">but I think her legs are paralyzed.</font>

593
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:56,260
<font color="yellow">Mom, I feel like this is all my fault,
and I don't know what to do.</font>

594
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,240
<font color="yellow">Why is that your fault?</font>

595
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,231
<font color="yellow">You didn't push her. Neither did
you curse her to get into an accident.</font>

596
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:04,840
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a foolish thing?</font>

597
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:09,880
<font color="yellow">It just hurt my heart to see
Jang-go having a hard time.</font>

598
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,304
<font color="yellow">I should have stopped him from going.</font>

599
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,183
<font color="yellow">All I can think about is that.</font>

600
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:18,074
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

601
00:48:20,246 --> 00:48:21,779
<font color="yellow">listen to me carefully.</font>

602
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,667
<font color="yellow">This happened because you
and Jang-go aren't meant to be.</font>

603
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:29,453
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

604
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:35,019
<font color="yellow">That's why you shouldn't say it's your fault.</font>

605
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:39,800
<font color="yellow">You should be stronger
in these kinds of situations.</font>

606
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,418
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

607
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,714
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, did you hear the rumor?</font>

608
00:48:52,503 --> 00:48:53,903
<font color="yellow">What rumor is it now?</font>

609
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:56,475
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Jang & Ko Law Firm is a mess right now!</font>

610
00:48:56,675 --> 00:48:59,335
<font color="yellow">The daughter of the president
of the law firm got into a car accident</font>

611
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,880
<font color="yellow">and became paralyzed
from the waist down.</font>

612
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:04,685
<font color="yellow">That's why they're in total panic right now.</font>

613
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,519
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

614
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:09,659
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. That's so sad.</font>

615
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:12,649
<font color="yellow">- But Young-ju...
- Yes?</font>

616
00:49:12,674 --> 00:49:15,597
<font color="yellow">Now you're bringing gossip
from over there, too?</font>

617
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:18,120
<font color="yellow">It's not that!</font>

618
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:22,144
<font color="yellow">The important thing is that there
was a man there when she got into</font>

619
00:49:22,494 --> 00:49:26,402
<font color="yellow">the accident, and the man happens
to be Mi-poong's lawyer friend!</font>

620
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:28,964
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Lee Jang-go?
- Really?</font>

621
00:49:29,402 --> 00:49:31,706
<font color="yellow">Then what's going to happen?</font>

622
00:49:32,183 --> 00:49:35,456
<font color="yellow">Her friend has to take
responsibility for that woman's life?</font>

623
00:49:36,566 --> 00:49:39,699
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. It seemed like
Mi-poong was dating him.</font>

624
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:40,925
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

625
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,957
<font color="yellow">But if he was there when she got into
an accident, it's not going to be easy for</font>

626
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,422
<font color="yellow">him to avoid responsibility. On top
of that, she's the daughter of a lawyer.</font>

627
00:49:49,707 --> 00:49:51,386
<font color="yellow">Would he let Mr. Lee get away with it?</font>

628
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:53,579
<font color="yellow">That's true. If he leaves
the handicapped woman,</font>

629
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:55,461
<font color="yellow">he'll be labeled as a jerk his whole life.</font>

630
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:58,188
<font color="yellow">Gosh. This situation is very ironic.</font>

631
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:01,474
<font color="yellow">Then what about our poor Mi-poong?</font>

632
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:04,744
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, you're here?</font>

633
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,831
<font color="yellow">- Hi!
- Good morning!</font>

634
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:13,441
<font color="yellow">Good morning!</font>

635
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:25,888
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, will I change
my last name to yours now?</font>

636
00:50:25,914 --> 00:50:28,245
<font color="yellow">Of course! You must change it!</font>

637
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:30,949
<font color="yellow">A Kim cannot live as a Park.</font>

638
00:50:31,871 --> 00:50:33,167
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

639
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:43,792
<font color="yellow">How long will it take for Shin-ae
to become my granddaughter?</font>

640
00:50:44,464 --> 00:50:50,039
<font color="yellow">She needs to officially change her last name
and file for a change of family registry.</font>

641
00:50:50,808 --> 00:50:53,394
<font color="yellow">It'll take about three to six months.</font>

642
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:56,025
<font color="yellow">Six months is too long!</font>

643
00:50:56,441 --> 00:50:58,511
<font color="yellow">Do it as quickly as you can!</font>

644
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:02,980
<font color="yellow">What if I die while I'm waiting?</font>

645
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:05,511
<font color="yellow">Grandfather.</font>

646
00:51:06,058 --> 00:51:08,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. I'll do my best.</font>

647
00:51:08,214 --> 00:51:09,683
<font color="yellow">Drink your tea.</font>

648
00:51:11,824 --> 00:51:14,368
<font color="yellow">Mom, all we have to do now
is make sure Hee-dong</font>

649
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:17,144
<font color="yellow">doesn't lose that spot
as his grandson-in-law, right?</font>

650
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:21,306
<font color="yellow">Of course. Of course.
When one door closes, another one will open.</font>

651
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,530
<font color="yellow">If I just wait three months,
grandfather's inheritance will be all mine.</font>

652
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:27,480
<font color="yellow">So nothing has to happen until then.</font>

653
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:31,299
<font color="yellow">In three months, it'll be my world.</font>

654
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:46,824
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Yes?</font>

655
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,914
<font color="yellow">This is really South Korea?</font>

656
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,378
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the South Korea
you always wanted to come to.</font>

657
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:55,886
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you lucky girl.</font>

658
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:58,362
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

659
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:07,131
<font color="yellow">- Please spread the word about us! Bye!
- Thank you!</font>

660
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:11,744
<font color="yellow">Goodness! There were so many people today!
I didn't even have time to sit down!</font>

661
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:16,597
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, I did well today, didn't I?</font>

662
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:19,943
<font color="yellow">You got much better,
but why didn't you explain</font>

663
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:22,745
<font color="yellow">to the woman in her forties
how to use the mat?</font>

664
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:24,589
<font color="yellow">I didn't?</font>

665
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:30,948
<font color="yellow">That was because she knew how to use
the mat, so I didn't have to explain it to her.</font>

666
00:52:31,222 --> 00:52:34,318
<font color="yellow">Still, all the mats can be differently used,</font>

667
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:37,300
<font color="yellow">so you must explain the directions to them.</font>

668
00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:39,387
<font color="yellow">Didn't my father tell you?</font>

669
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:41,331
<font color="yellow">Not to be dull?</font>

670
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:43,949
<font color="yellow">He did.</font>

671
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:45,549
<font color="yellow">I hate dull things, too.</font>

672
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:48,488
<font color="yellow">That's why our family motto is,
"Don't live dully."</font>

673
00:52:49,652 --> 00:52:51,144
<font color="yellow">We should put the motto here, too.</font>

674
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:54,738
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, you need to go to
the academy. Hurry up and get ready.</font>

675
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:55,839
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

676
00:52:58,629 --> 00:53:01,362
<font color="yellow">- Were there a lot of clients today?
- Yes.</font>

677
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:03,253
<font color="yellow">We hit jackpot today!</font>

678
00:53:03,574 --> 00:53:07,766
<font color="yellow">There were about fifty people today.
People kept going</font>

679
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:11,754
<font color="yellow">in and out of here.
I didn't even have time to rest!</font>

680
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:14,019
<font color="yellow">- Dull.
- Dull.</font>

681
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:17,050
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

682
00:53:17,535 --> 00:53:21,339
<font color="yellow">Yes! There were exactly
fifty-two people today! Look here!</font>

683
00:53:23,058 --> 00:53:24,409
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

684
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,449
<font color="yellow">I hope you will continue
to be exact from now on.</font>

685
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:31,420
<font color="yellow">Father, I'm ready to go.</font>

686
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:33,516
<font color="yellow">Go outside and wait.</font>

687
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:34,691
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

688
00:53:39,597 --> 00:53:40,597
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

689
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,593
<font color="yellow">Give it to Ms. Hwang.</font>

690
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,031
<font color="yellow">My sister-in-law?</font>

691
00:53:47,379 --> 00:53:50,883
<font color="yellow">It's her birthday present.
I heard it was her birthday last time.</font>

692
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:55,355
<font color="yellow">Why would you buy a birthday gift for her?</font>

693
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:59,180
<font color="yellow">Why else? It's the birthday of
my employee's family member. So as your</font>

694
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:01,308
<font color="yellow">boss, I should definitely
get her a birthday gift!</font>

695
00:54:02,644 --> 00:54:03,844
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

696
00:54:06,628 --> 00:54:07,792
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

697
00:54:08,815 --> 00:54:11,073
<font color="yellow">Is he interested in Geum-sil, or is he being</font>

698
00:54:11,098 --> 00:54:13,505
<font color="yellow">nice to my family
because he's interested in me?</font>

699
00:54:20,746 --> 00:54:22,142
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Jo.</font>

700
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,741
<font color="yellow">- Anything unusual?
- No. Welcome back.</font>

701
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:32,865
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo is still not coming out?</font>

702
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:36,276
<font color="yellow">Yes, she got another job.</font>

703
00:54:37,543 --> 00:54:38,543
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

704
00:54:49,804 --> 00:54:55,309
<font color="yellow"><i>Still, I can live, I am happy</i></font>

are always sparkling, it's livable</i></font>

707
00:55:13,116 --> 00:55:14,116
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

708
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:17,081
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, aren't you going home?</font>

709
00:55:17,874 --> 00:55:20,440
<font color="yellow">Go ahead first. I'm going
to do some more work.</font>

710
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:22,014
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

711
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,897
<font color="yellow">When you have a lot on
your mind, work can be medicine.</font>

<font color="yellow">Good job today.</font>

713
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:28,067
<font color="yellow">- Cheer up.
- Keep up the hard work.</font>

714
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:29,827
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

715
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,989
<font color="yellow">Please stop her!</font>

<font color="yellow">- I hate this!
- Ha-yeon!</font>

717
00:55:45,483 --> 00:55:46,483
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

718
00:55:47,951 --> 00:55:48,967
<font color="yellow">Jang-go...</font>

719
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,223
<font color="yellow">That's why you should have
broken up with him when I told you to!</font>

720
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:58,579
<font color="yellow">Why are you sticking to my son like
a leech and creating all this chaos?</font>

721
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,861
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for you,
they would've been in</font>

722
00:56:01,886 --> 00:56:04,868
<font color="yellow">England by now, and none
of this would have happened!</font>

<font color="yellow">Jang-go.</font>

724
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:40,306
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

725
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:42,063
<font color="yellow">I want to sit up.</font>

726
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:44,337
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

727
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:53,306
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

728
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:54,923
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

729
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:56,852
<font color="yellow">Do you want something to drink?</font>

730
00:56:57,188 --> 00:56:58,718
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want anything.</font>

731
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:05,907
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go outside?
It's a bit chilly though.</font>

734
00:57:14,509 --> 00:57:16,746
<font color="yellow">I can't hold you back anymore.</font>

<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon.</font>

736
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:19,961
<font color="yellow">It's the truth.</font>

737
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:25,016
<font color="yellow">I lost you even when my legs were normal.</font>

738
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:29,915
<font color="yellow">You must hate me more now.</font>

739
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:36,359
<font color="yellow">Since you're next to me...</font>

740
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:40,071
<font color="yellow">I feel more pathetic.</font>

741
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:44,817
<font color="yellow">I'll get you some warm water.</font>

742
00:58:30,118 --> 00:58:31,118
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

743
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:35,086
<font color="yellow">Go home and rest. I can be here alone.</font>

744
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:39,287
<font color="yellow">How can I go home
when Ha-yeon is in that state?</font>

745
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,949
<font color="yellow">She said I'm taking place of her late mom.</font>

746
00:58:44,306 --> 00:58:46,706
<font color="yellow">Give that to me. I'll get the water.</font>

747
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:52,729
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get some fresh air.</font>

748
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:54,970
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

749
00:59:34,392 --> 00:59:38,024
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon, are you walking right now?</font>

750
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:42,257
<font color="yellow">Since when did you start walking?</font>

751
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:45,389
<font color="yellow">Since just now.</font>

752
00:59:47,196 --> 00:59:49,071
<font color="yellow">Is this a dream or not?</font>

753
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:52,860
<font color="yellow">I was so worried you would
never be able to walk again!</font>

754
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:56,782
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness, Ha-yeon! I'm so happy for you!</font>

755
00:59:57,165 --> 01:00:00,781
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! I should tell
Jang-go the good news! Jang-go!</font>

756
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:01,430
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

757
01:00:15,985 --> 01:00:19,188
<font color="yellow">Please don't tell Jang-go.</font>

758
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,025
<font color="yellow">Mother, you'll do that for me, won't you?</font>

759
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,157
<font color="yellow">Please don't tell Jang-go.</font>

760
01:00:30,937 --> 01:00:34,180
<font color="yellow">This isn't for me. This is all for Jang-go.</font>

761
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:48,946
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

762
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:51,329
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

763
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:56,353
<font color="yellow">Don't go in there right now.</font>

764
01:00:57,438 --> 01:00:58,638
<font color="yellow">Ha-yeon is crying.</font>

765
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:02,016
<font color="yellow">She doesn't want to show you this side of her.</font>

766
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:06,930
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her.</font>

767
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:14,485
<font color="yellow">She used to smile so happily,
so how did she end up that way?</font>

768
01:01:17,196 --> 01:01:21,805
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, can't you stay by Ha-yeon's side?</font>

769
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,954
<font color="yellow">Stay by her side.</font>

770
01:01:26,556 --> 01:01:29,008
<font color="yellow">Be her strength to live again.</font>

771
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:32,034
<font color="yellow">If you can't do it,</font>

772
01:01:33,282 --> 01:01:35,899
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stay by her side.</font>

773
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:44,328
<font color="yellow">I meant it when I said
I think of her as my daughter.</font>

774
01:01:45,626 --> 01:01:49,079
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to do that.</font>

775
01:01:51,149 --> 01:01:54,482
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go, do you
really have the confidence to</font>

776
01:01:54,898 --> 01:01:57,922
<font color="yellow">live your life without being
concerned about Ha-yeon?</font>

777
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:03,548
<font color="yellow">Can you really do that?</font>

778
01:02:07,048 --> 01:02:10,982
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her, Jang-go.</font>

779
01:02:13,259 --> 01:02:15,243
<font color="yellow">What do we do, Jang-go?</font>

780
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:20,563
<font color="yellow">Poor Ha-yeon.</font>

781
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:23,446
<font color="yellow">What can we do?</font>

782
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:46,413
<font color="yellow"><i>When my chest feels stuffy, I close both eyes</i></font>

783
01:02:46,747 --> 01:03:00,927
<font color="yellow"><i>Into the wind, I whisper your name</i></font>

784
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:10,103
<font color="yellow"><i>Though time passes for me,</i></font>

785
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:16,370
<font color="yellow"><i>The memories remain</i></font>

786
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:23,517
<font color="yellow"><i>My heart that is stuck on you</i></font>

787
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,279
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, it's me.</font>

788
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:27,649
<font color="yellow">Let's meet up.</font>

789
01:03:29,407 --> 01:03:30,682
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

790
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:41,101
<font color="yellow"><i>Wind, sunlight, memories</i></font>

791
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:48,842
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't forget that beautiful day</i></font>

792
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:56,216
<font color="yellow"><i>You still remain in a corner of my heart</i></font>

793
01:03:56,216 --> 01:04:04,257
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if you blow into the wind</i></font>

794
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:14,935
<font color="yellow"><i>My heart that wasn't conveyed, you can't know</i></font>

795
01:04:15,681 --> 01:04:16,681
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

796
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:18,165
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

797
01:04:19,603 --> 01:04:21,008
<font color="yellow">I'll go first.</font>

798
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:29,258

<font color="yellow">Jang-go...</font>

800

<font color="yellow">let's break up.</font>

801
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:45,001
<font color="yellow">Let's do that.</font>

802
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:49,321
<font color="yellow">You're not throwing me away.</font>

803

<font color="yellow">I...</font>

805
01:05:01,204 --> 01:05:03,000
<font color="yellow">I just want to stop here.</font>

<font color="yellow">No matter how many times I think about this,</font>

807
01:05:09,063 --> 01:05:11,057
<font color="yellow">I think our relationship ends here.</font>

808

So why can't I do this?</font>
