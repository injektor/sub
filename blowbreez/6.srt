00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:11,377
<font color="yellow">It's that way.</font>

3
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:12,725
<font color="yellow">-That way? -Yes.</font>

4
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,725
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,678
<font color="yellow">Oh, are you the new tenants?</font>

6
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,256
<font color="yellow">-Yes, grandma. -I see.</font>

7
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,624
<font color="yellow">Yes, we are. Hello.</font>

8
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:35,347
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to express my gratitude towards you for helping us out like this.</font>

9
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:39,318
<font color="yellow">But is this all that's in your family? Is there anyone else?</font>

10
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:43,912
<font color="yellow">No, it's just us three.</font>

11
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:45,443
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

12
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,438
<font color="yellow">-This is the key for the back gate. -I see.</font>

13
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:53,736
<font color="yellow">The previous tenant said it was uncomfortable for her to</font>

14
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:57,090
<font color="yellow">use the same gate as us, so she always used the back gate.</font>

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,197
<font color="yellow">You can use the same front gate as us, but it'll</font>

16
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,715
<font color="yellow">be comfortable for you to use the back gate.</font>

17
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:05,104
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

18
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,420
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

19
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:15,741
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness. Unlike most people nowadays, you guys are very courteous.</font>

20
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,560
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You guys will live well.</font>

21
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,490
<font color="yellow">Oh, go on and move your belongings.</font>

22
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:23,349
<font color="yellow">-Yes, excuse us. -Of course.</font>

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

24
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:32,365
<font color="yellow">They're extremely courteous.</font>

25
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:36,512
<font color="yellow">But what did you mean by you wanted me to pretend</font>

26
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,014
<font color="yellow">not to know you in front of those people?</font>

27
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,510
<font color="yellow">Let's go in. I'll tell you inside.</font>

28
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:44,483
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

29
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:48,928
<font color="yellow">They don't have any place to go, so they are</font>

30
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:50,643
<font color="yellow">going to pay their security deposit later.</font>

31
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:53,115
<font color="yellow">I thought their pride would get hurt if they</font>

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,999
<font color="yellow">know this is my house. I know them personally.</font>

33
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:59,406
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Why would you lie about that?</font>

34
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,715
<font color="yellow">It's only a matter of time before they find out that you live here.</font>

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,472
<font color="yellow">That's true, but I will explain it to them later on.</font>

36
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:08,647
<font color="yellow">Or else, with their pride, they wouldn't have moved in here.</font>

37
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:13,688
<font color="yellow">Goodness. They don't have a place to go, so what's the point of having pride?</font>

38
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:17,796
<font color="yellow">Anyways, for the time being, you can't let them know I live here, okay?</font>

39
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,647
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

40
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,378
<font color="yellow">That's not hard to do at all.</font>

41
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,053
<font color="yellow">We're done.</font>

42
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:30,265
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

43
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:33,749
<font color="yellow">-Thank you. -Thank you.</font>

44
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:35,853
<font color="yellow">-Thank you. -Thank you.</font>

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,879
<font color="yellow">Good-bye.</font>

46
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,631
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

47
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,459
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

48
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:00,327
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

49
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:02,770
<font color="yellow">Do you like the house?</font>

50
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,889
<font color="yellow">-We love it! -We love it!</font>

51
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:10,436
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, thank you so much.</font>

52
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:14,038
<font color="yellow">It's clean and cozy, and there's plenty of sunshine.</font>

53
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,503
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I can thank you for finding such an amazing house for us.</font>

54
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:22,822
<font color="yellow">I'm getting embarrassed because you keep saying that.</font>

55
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,330
<font color="yellow">All I did was ask the house owner to let you move in.</font>

56
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:29,374
<font color="yellow">Who would do such a thing for people like us?</font>

57
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:32,294
<font color="yellow">We really won't forget your kindness.</font>

58
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:38,786
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! I'm sorry for embarrassing you, Mr. Lee,</font>

59
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:44,061
<font color="yellow">but I'm so grateful that I keep thanking you.</font>

60
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:48,045
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, Mi-poong takes after you.</font>

61
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,762
<font color="yellow">She talks a lot, just like you do.</font>

62
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,983
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

63
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,014
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

64
00:03:58,413 --> 00:03:59,413
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

65
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:03,437
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but something came up, so I think I'll have to leave now.</font>

66
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:07,303
<font color="yellow">You don't have to apologize. You helped us even when you're so busy.</font>

67
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,896
<font color="yellow">No matter what we do, we won't be able to pay you back for your kindness.</font>

68
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:17,294
<font color="yellow">I see. I'll be going now.</font>

69
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:18,522
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

70
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,444
<font color="yellow">-Good-bye. -Bye, Mr. Lee.</font>

71
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:24,702
<font color="yellow">-Good-bye. -Thank you.</font>

72
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:34,557
<font color="yellow">Mom, since you keep doing that, Mr. Lee is getting embarrassed.</font>

73
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,552
<font color="yellow">What can I do when I'm so grateful to him?</font>

74
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,904
<font color="yellow">Anyways, is this really our home, Mi-poong?</font>

75
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:48,491
<font color="yellow">Is this a dream or reality?</font>

76
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,820
<font color="yellow">This feels like a dream for me, too.</font>

77
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,835
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, pinch your grandma and me.</font>

78
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,014
<font color="yellow">Pinch us.</font>

79
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,703
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream!</font>

80
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:06,150
<font color="yellow">-Really? It's not a dream? -It's not a dream?</font>

81
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,944
<font color="yellow">Here. This is the $5,000 you need.</font>

82
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:39,498
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I keep borrowing money from you when I haven't paid anything back yet.</font>

83
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,732
<font color="yellow">I'll pay this money back to you very soon.</font>

84
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:45,392
<font color="yellow">You can take your time. It's not like I have to use it anytime soon.</font>

85
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:48,787
<font color="yellow">You're not the type to run away and not pay my money back.</font>

86
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:49,812
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

87
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,346
<font color="yellow">Thank you for understanding me, Geum-sil.</font>

88
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,498
<font color="yellow">The coffee is cold now because I went to the bank.</font>

89
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,756
<font color="yellow">Should I order another cup?</font>

90
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:00,075
<font color="yellow">No, you don't have to.</font>

91
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,291
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I hope that your daughter and my son</font>

92
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:06,641
<font color="yellow">will like each other when they meet tomorrow.</font>

93
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,084
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

94
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:09,522
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

95
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:13,854
<font color="yellow">If it goes well for our kids and we become in-laws, we'll become a family,</font>

96
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,319
<font color="yellow">so there's no burden when we have to borrow money from each other.</font>

97
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,789
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about it makes me happy. What about you?</font>

98
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:27,861
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. Geum-sil, I'm sorry, but I have to go now.</font>

99
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,802
<font color="yellow">Okay, I have to go, too.</font>

100
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,842
<font color="yellow">It's tomorrow at the Prince Hotel at noon. Make sure to tell your daughter.</font>

101
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,725
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'll pay for the coffee.</font>

102
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:45,676
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil is letting me borrow money from her</font>

103
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,177
<font color="yellow">because she wants to set up our kids together.</font>

104
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:51,442
<font color="yellow">I fell into that trap.</font>

105
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:53,918
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

106
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:58,581
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil is sly and scary.</font>

107
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,432
<font color="yellow">But Geum-sil, dream on.</font>

108
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,700
<font color="yellow">That'll never happen.</font>

109
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,512
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

110
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,247
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

111
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:15,752
<font color="yellow">Don't live your life like that.</font>

112
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,888
<font color="yellow">There's something called affection between people.</font>

113
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:22,235
<font color="yellow">I treated you like that because I felt comfortable</font>

114
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,335
<font color="yellow">with you, like you were part of my family.</font>

115
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:28,993
<font color="yellow">You ratted out on me to my father and made me into</font>

116
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,684
<font color="yellow">some nasty person who doesn't pay her workers.</font>

117
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:35,457
<font color="yellow">I'm so disappointed.</font>

118
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:38,807
<font color="yellow">-It's just that it happened more than once- -Is this a dishcloth or a rag?</font>

119
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:42,381
<font color="yellow">Before you demand for money, make sure you do your work right!</font>

120
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,574
<font color="yellow">Inconsiderate woman!</font>

121
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:56,689
<font color="yellow">Because of her, I have to ask around for favors!</font>

122
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,349
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm home.</font>

123
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:01,622
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

124
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,142
<font color="yellow">You're coming home now, sweetie?</font>

125
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:07,880
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

126
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,340
<font color="yellow">Talk to me?</font>

127
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:11,325
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

128
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:17,630
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow at the Prince Hotel at noon, just eat lunch and come home.</font>

129
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:20,414
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to meet your friend's son?</font>

130
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,301
<font color="yellow">I told you I won't go on blind dates anymore.</font>

131
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,551
<font color="yellow">Use that smart brain of yours to hear me out.</font>

132
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:27,483
<font color="yellow">It's not a blind date!</font>

133
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:32,975
<font color="yellow">Just eat lunch and come home. Pretend like you're on a blind date.</font>

134
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,810
<font color="yellow">Why the heck do I have to do that?</font>

135
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:39,529
<font color="yellow">I have my reason.</font>

136
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:41,932
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me about it.</font>

137
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:47,707
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Does she have your weakness?</font>

138
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,582
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that.</font>

139
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,390
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because it would be nice to be close to a lawyer.</font>

140
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,919
<font color="yellow">So to simply put it, you want me to go out tomorrow, just eat</font>

141
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,658
<font color="yellow">lunch, and dump him while telling him he's not my style. Right?</font>

142
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,895
<font color="yellow">My smart little girl. My cutie pie.</font>

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
<font color="yellow">You got it!</font>

144
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,135
<font color="yellow">Fine then. I'll do it one condition.</font>

145
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,998
<font color="yellow">I'll go out tomorrow and pretend it's a real blind date,</font>

146
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,984
<font color="yellow">buy me a bag. A new one just came in.</font>

147
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:20,927
<font color="yellow">What? A bag?</font>

148
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,630
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

149
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:24,715
<font color="yellow">Then forget it.</font>

150
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,021
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

151
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:33,942
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom! This is too much!</font>

152
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:39,458
<font color="yellow">-I don't have any money. Just help me out this once. -This is the last time.</font>

153
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,885
<font color="yellow">-Gosh, mom. -My cutie.</font>

154
00:09:58,694 --> 00:10:01,340
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Where's the phoenix?</font>

155
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:03,968
<font color="yellow">It was a dream?</font>

156
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,096
<font color="yellow">It must have been a dream.</font>

157
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,092
<font color="yellow">But what kind of dream was this?</font>

158
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,592
<font color="yellow">What kind of dream is so vivid?</font>

159
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,147
<font color="yellow">Am I winning the lottery?</font>

160
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:22,639
<font color="yellow">Phoenix dream.</font>

161
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:26,214
<font color="yellow">It's right here.</font>

162
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,106
<font color="yellow">A dream of a phoenix coming into a home means that a precious guest will be coming.</font>

163
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:36,725
<font color="yellow">If a single person dreams of this, it means they'll meet a wonderful partner.</font>

164
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:40,235
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil. Geum-sil!</font>

165
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,975
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I hit jackpot!</font>

166
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,436
<font color="yellow">A huge jackpot!</font>

167
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:47,702
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

168
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,976
<font color="yellow">After work, I must have been so tired, because I fell asleep.</font>

169
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:54,402
<font color="yellow">But do you know what I dreamed of?</font>

170
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,655
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and buy my dream!</font>

171
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:58,963
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you dream of pigs?</font>

172
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:01,367
<font color="yellow">How dare you compare pigs to my dream!</font>

173
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,856
<font color="yellow">You know what a phoenix is, right?</font>

174
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:08,791
<font color="yellow">A dazzling gold phoenix came right into our front gate!</font>

175
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,011
<font color="yellow">Just now!</font>

176
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:13,270
<font color="yellow">A gold phoenix came into our house?</font>

177
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:14,561
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

178
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:17,841
<font color="yellow">It was so vivid that I searched up phoenix dreams,</font>

179
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,355
<font color="yellow">and it said that we'll either get a precious guest or,</font>

180
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,770
<font color="yellow">if you're single, you'll meet a wonderful partner.</font>

181
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:26,051
<font color="yellow">This is Jang-go's dream!</font>

182
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,709
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it was a phoenix dream?</font>

183
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,399
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a chicken?</font>

184
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:33,811
<font color="yellow">You don't think I can tell the difference between a chicken and a phoenix?</font>

185
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,964
<font color="yellow">I thought it was a dream for Jang-go, so I was going to sell it to you, but forget it.</font>

186
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,749
<font color="yellow">No, no. I'll buy it.</font>

187
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,772
<font color="yellow">I'll buy it.</font>

188
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,201
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

189
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:47,850
<font color="yellow">Here. A hundred dollars. Happy?</font>

190
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,248
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,155
<font color="yellow">Then is she the phoenix?</font>

192
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:57,655
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

193
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:02,515
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow, Jang-go and my friend's daughter is going to meet.</font>

194
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,131
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, that's it.</font>

195
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,348
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow, they're going to like each other,</font>

196
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,415
<font color="yellow">and she's going to become part of our family.</font>

197
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:12,036
<font color="yellow">I wish everything worked out just like you said!</font>

198
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,182
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's been a while since you came home</font>

199
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,991
<font color="yellow">from work, but you haven't even changed your clothes yet.</font>

200
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:23,886
<font color="yellow">What are you two up to lately?</font>

201
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:25,248
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

202
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,563
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

203
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,329
<font color="yellow">You don't have to know.</font>

204
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:30,939
<font color="yellow">I dare you to say that to me again!</font>

205
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,873
<font color="yellow">I'll rip your mouth off!</font>

206
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:35,881
<font color="yellow">-Mom. -Nam-yi.</font>

207
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,536
<font color="yellow">I should wash and sleep.</font>

208
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:48,993
<font color="yellow">I gave the key to the back gate to the new tenants today.</font>

209
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,530
<font color="yellow">What are they like?</font>

210
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:56,514
<font color="yellow">They're very courteous. It's just a mom, her daughter, and her grandson.</font>

211
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:01,846
<font color="yellow">If there's anything you need to tell them, you should go see them now.</font>

212
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:05,835
<font color="yellow">You and Jang-go already met them. I can meet them later.</font>

213
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:22,491
<font color="yellow">Maybe the owner is here.</font>

214
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,230
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and answer the door.</font>

215
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:34,219
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, what are you doing here?</font>

216
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,272
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're here.</font>

217
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,795
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

218
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,530
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

219
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:44,294
<font color="yellow">Pardon me.</font>

220
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:45,451
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

221
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:52,290
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, what's that?</font>

222
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,093
<font color="yellow">This?</font>

223
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,380
<font color="yellow">I wonder what it is.</font>

224
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,139
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

225
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,218
<font color="yellow">I bought it for you.</font>

226
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,166
<font color="yellow">It's the jelly that I like!</font>

227
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,123
<font color="yellow">Why would you give such a thing to him at night?</font>

228
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,306
<font color="yellow">If Yoo-sung gets cavities because of this, will you take responsibility for it?</font>

229
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:13,455
<font color="yellow">I thought he would like it.</font>

230
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:16,658
<font color="yellow">It's just one time, so it shouldn't matter.</font>

231
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,483
<font color="yellow">He bought it for Yoo-sung.</font>

232
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:22,576
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, thank Mr. Lee before you eat it.</font>

233
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,647
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mr. Lee!</font>

234
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,286
<font color="yellow">But don't eat too much, okay?</font>

235
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:29,439
<font color="yellow">I'll get in trouble by your aunt.</font>

236
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:37,383
<font color="yellow">But what are you doing here?</font>

237
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:42,881
<font color="yellow">While you were moving in, I noticed that there was a hole in the screen.</font>

238
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:44,327
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

239
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:47,991
<font color="yellow">There are many mosquitoes at this time of the year.</font>

240
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,569
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

241
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,576
<font color="yellow">You came because of that?</font>

242
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:55,616
<font color="yellow">We're troubling you too much.</font>

243
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,709
<font color="yellow">We have nothing to serve you.</font>

244
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:02,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mi-poong! Go and buy a bottle of juice. Mr. Lee must be thirsty.</font>

245
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,715
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

246
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:05,739
<font color="yellow">I'm not thirsty.</font>

247
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,537
<font color="yellow">I'll just do this quickly and go.</font>

248
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,217
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

249
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,241
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

250
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:47,991
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

251
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,747
<font color="yellow">Not even one mosquito will be able to come inside now.</font>

252
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,339
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

253
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:57,882
<font color="yellow">We haven't finished unpacking yet, so we can't even serve you a cup of tea.</font>

254
00:16:58,272 --> 00:17:00,103
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad.</font>

255
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,545
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine. You can give it to me next time.</font>

256
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,412
<font color="yellow">Okay. Make sure you come again, Mr. Lee.</font>

257
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,832
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

258
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,359
<font color="yellow">-Bye. -Bye.</font>

259
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,885
<font color="yellow">See him out.</font>

260
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,335
<font color="yellow">Okay, mom.</font>

261
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:22,202
<font color="yellow">-I'll say hello to the owner, too. -Okay.</font>

262
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:34,804
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee...</font>

263
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,285
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep calling me Seung-hee?</font>

264
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:42,054
<font color="yellow">At this rate, my mom will find out that you're Jang-go.</font>

265
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:44,054
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

266
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:48,505
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I need to talk to you.</font>

267
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:50,905
<font color="yellow">Okay, talk to me.</font>

268
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:58,420
<font color="yellow">I can't talk to you here. Let's go out.</font>

269
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:20,670
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why are you hesitating?</font>

270
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,613
<font color="yellow">Is it something bad?</font>

271
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:27,350
<font color="yellow">Did something go wrong with our security deposit?</font>

272
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:29,847
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that.</font>

273
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:31,638
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

274
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,395
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

275
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:37,054
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

276
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:39,610
<font color="yellow">that's my house.</font>

277
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,170
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

278
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:46,725
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

279
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:51,386
<font color="yellow">So the thing is...</font>

280
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,150
<font color="yellow">that house you moved into today is mine.</font>

281
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,011
<font color="yellow">It's your house?</font>

282
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,257
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

283
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,710
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

284
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:11,701
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not telling you the truth.</font>

285
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:14,991
<font color="yellow">I thought you would have said no if I had told you the truth.</font>

286
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,922
<font color="yellow">Of course I would have!</font>

287
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,217
<font color="yellow">How could you fool me like this?</font>

288
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:23,085
<font color="yellow">Are you joking? Do you think we're easy?</font>

289
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,296
<font color="yellow">How could you do whatever you want?</font>

290
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,488
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee. No. Mi-poong.</font>

291
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:30,374
<font color="yellow">Calm down and listen to me.</font>

292
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,051
<font color="yellow">Do I look like a fool to you because I lost my security deposit in a fraud?</font>

293
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,584
<font color="yellow">You thought it was okay that you can do as you please</font>

294
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,686
<font color="yellow">with me because I'm a poor North Korean defector, huh?</font>

295
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:42,827
<font color="yellow">Kim Seung-hee.</font>

296
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,084
<font color="yellow">That's not it!</font>

297
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:47,885
<font color="yellow">We'll move out tomorrow.</font>

298
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,530
<font color="yellow">To where?</font>

299
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:55,173
<font color="yellow">Do you even have money to move?</font>

300
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:04,597
<font color="yellow">Or will you return to that storage room again?</font>

301
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,786
<font color="yellow">Will they even accept you? What if they don't?</font>

302
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,451
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you and your family will go out into the streets?</font>

303
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,709
<font color="yellow">How can you only think of your pride?</font>

304
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,035
<font color="yellow">Don't you think of Yoo-sung and your mother?</font>

305
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,592
<font color="yellow">They had to go to the emergency room because they were sick!</font>

306
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,062
<font color="yellow">But how can you say that?</font>

307
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,530
<font color="yellow">It was nice to see your mother and Yoo-sung so happy after you guys moved in.</font>

308
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,983
<font color="yellow">I just found out today that your mother is a talkative person.</font>

309
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,483
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel.</font>

310
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:53,730
<font color="yellow">I do understand,</font>

311
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:58,358
<font color="yellow">but you should realize that this is the best for now.</font>

312
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:03,142
<font color="yellow">Receive your security deposit first, make a lot of money,</font>

313
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:07,350
<font color="yellow">and then you can move out if a better house appears.</font>

314
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:15,319
<font color="yellow">My mother and your mother know each other.</font>

315
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:19,362
<font color="yellow">My mother will faint if she finds out.</font>

316
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:22,866
<font color="yellow">I told my mother that you're my friend's sibling's family.</font>

317
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:25,530
<font color="yellow">I thought I wouldn't have to bring it up on purpose.</font>

318
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,688
<font color="yellow">Just like your mother didn't recognize me, my mother won't recognize you guys, too.</font>

319
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,840
<font color="yellow">We'll tell them when the time is right.</font>

320
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:35,199
<font color="yellow">When your security deposit is returned to you, and</font>

321
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:37,369
<font color="yellow">you still feel uncomfortable, you can move out then.</font>

322
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,543
<font color="yellow">Let's do that, Seung-hee.</font>

323
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,072
<font color="yellow">I mean, Mi-poong.</font>

324
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,244
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

325
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:50,384
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

326
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,189
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

327
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:57,384
<font color="yellow">Jang-go...</font>

328
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:01,447
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

329
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,035
<font color="yellow">If you're so grateful, buy me a meal next time.</font>

330
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:08,195
<font color="yellow">Just so you know, I really like black bean noodles.</font>

331
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:14,806
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

332
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,406
<font color="yellow">I'll definitely buy you black bean noodles.</font>

333
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:21,055
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

334
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:39,729
<font color="yellow">Aunt, this place is so nice!</font>

335
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:43,969
<font color="yellow">The water is really warm, and the bathroom isn't cold at all.</font>

336
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:45,564
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, did you take a bath?</font>

337
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,033
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

338
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:50,021
<font color="yellow">You're so cute, Yoo-sung!</font>

339
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:53,421
<font color="yellow">You took a bath, so you're all clean and shiny!</font>

340
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:58,400
<font color="yellow">Did you say hello to the owner?</font>

341
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:04,553
<font color="yellow">I thought it was too late, so I just came back.</font>

342
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,183
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

343
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:07,884
<font color="yellow">Just leave it.</font>

344
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:11,088
<font color="yellow">We already greeted the grandmother already.</font>

345
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:12,984
<font color="yellow">We can greet her later.</font>

346
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:19,118
<font color="yellow">But, if you didn't go see the owner, were you with Mr. Lee all this time?</font>

347
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,366
<font color="yellow">Did you two drink tea?</font>

348
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,329
<font color="yellow">Of course not, mom.</font>

349
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:28,353
<font color="yellow">We just talked a bit.</font>

350
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:30,165
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

351
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:32,587
<font color="yellow">Nothing much.</font>

352
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:38,424
<font color="yellow">Just about when we'll get our security deposit back.</font>

353
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,370
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

354
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:45,693
<font color="yellow">About Mr. Lee, Mi-poong...</font>

355
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:50,185
<font color="yellow">Is he interested in you?</font>

356
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,286
<font color="yellow">Mom! What are you talking about?</font>

357
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:56,603
<font color="yellow">He's not!</font>

358
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,446
<font color="yellow">Then why else would he be so nice to us?</font>

359
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:01,876
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom.</font>

360
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,015
<font color="yellow">He's just helping us out because we're pitiful. Don't imagine nonsense like that.</font>

361
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,185
<font color="yellow">It makes me feel sorry to Mr. Lee.</font>

362
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,046
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

363
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:21,337
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee has a good career, good looks, and a good personality.</font>

364
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:24,045
<font color="yellow">He must have a girlfriend, right?</font>

365
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,540
<font color="yellow">I have to finish unpacking.</font>

366
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:02,968
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

367
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:06,569
<font color="yellow">Mom. What about Jang-soo?</font>

368
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:10,144
<font color="yellow">I don't know. He must be drinking somewhere again.</font>

369
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:11,755
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

370
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:14,819
<font color="yellow">Drink this. It's red ginseng.</font>

371
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,346
<font color="yellow">You should drink it.</font>

372
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,200
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

373
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:20,364
<font color="yellow">You work outside.</font>

374
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,271
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

375
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:30,148
<font color="yellow">You saw my text, right?</font>

376
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:32,008
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow noon at Prince Hotel.</font>

377
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,564
<font color="yellow">I saw it, but what is it for?</font>

378
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:37,154
<font color="yellow">You saw it, but why didn't you reply?</font>

379
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:39,474
<font color="yellow">I was busy.</font>

380
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:43,141
<font color="yellow">Since you didn't reply, I already told them you were okay with it.</font>

381
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:45,591
<font color="yellow">Mom, is it...?</font>

382
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:46,763
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

383
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,081
<font color="yellow">My friend and I won't be there. You'll be meeting her daughter alone.</font>

384
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:53,036
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom.</font>

385
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:56,464
<font color="yellow">How can you make such a plan without asking me first?</font>

386
00:25:56,996 --> 00:25:59,541
<font color="yellow">You should start dating now.</font>

387
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:01,499
<font color="yellow">All you've done is study and work so far.</font>

388
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,138
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to get married?</font>

389
00:26:03,154 --> 00:26:04,357
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of that.</font>

390
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:06,316
<font color="yellow">And my office isn't even stable yet.</font>

391
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:08,654
<font color="yellow">You can do that after you get married.</font>

392
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:12,374
<font color="yellow">And more than anything else, my friend's daughter</font>

393
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,950
<font color="yellow">is lively and honest. I really like her.</font>

394
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:18,698
<font color="yellow">I really don't want to lose her.</font>

395
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:22,067
<font color="yellow">Mom, I really don't like such meetings.</font>

396
00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:24,217
<font color="yellow">Then just this once.</font>

397
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,362
<font color="yellow">Just do it for my sake this once. Please, Jang-go?</font>

398
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,687
<font color="yellow">I already arranged the meeting. Are you going to embarrass me like this?</font>

399
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:39,482
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

400
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,651
<font color="yellow">Good. Thank you, Jang-go.</font>

401
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:43,915
<font color="yellow">You can't go wrong if you do as I say.</font>

402
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:45,693
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

403
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:51,799
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

404
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,009
<font color="yellow">Although I'm just going to eat, but if you want to eat</font>

405
00:27:58,033 --> 00:28:00,585
<font color="yellow">with me, you need to wait at least fifteen minutes.</font>

406
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:16,614
<font color="yellow">What the heck? It's that psycho from last time!</font>

407
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,615
<font color="yellow">Why must he be here out of all places?</font>

408
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:21,271
<font color="yellow">How annoying!</font>

409
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:33,912
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

410
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:36,294
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Jang-go, the one you're supposed to meet today.</font>

411
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,772
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Hello.</font>

412
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:39,900
<font color="yellow">I'm here already.</font>

413
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,201
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

414
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:42,947
<font color="yellow">I arrived here just now.</font>

415
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:44,427
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

416
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:53,873
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-Ra?</font>

417
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,068
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go?</font>

418
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:02,358
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Is mom crazy?</font>

419
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,026
<font color="yellow">How can she tell me to eat with that psycho?</font>

420
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:07,797
<font color="yellow">I can't let this one slide!</font>

421
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,833
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

422
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:15,201
<font color="yellow">Damn car.</font>

423
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:16,982
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

424
00:29:21,537 --> 00:29:22,958
<font color="yellow">Look here, mister!</font>

425
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:24,674
<font color="yellow">You can't just go.</font>

426
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:26,123
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

427
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:29,451
<font color="yellow">You just hit my car's door.</font>

428
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,074
<font color="yellow">Look! Look at that!</font>

429
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:35,160
<font color="yellow">It's dented!</font>

430
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,085
<font color="yellow">How dare you accuse an innocent person.</font>

431
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,679
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. You hit my car's door just now so how can you play innocent?</font>

432
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:46,703
<font color="yellow">I saw it with my own two eyes!</font>

433
00:29:46,728 --> 00:29:49,785
<font color="yellow">So why would you park like that?</font>

434
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,197
<font color="yellow">Park properly from now on. Got it?</font>

435
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:57,064
<font color="yellow">Mister, if you don't solve this and just leave, I'm going to call the police.</font>

436
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:59,696
<font color="yellow">Police? My god.</font>

437
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,027
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

438
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:04,649
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of me!</font>

439
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:05,674
<font color="yellow">You little-</font>

440
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,623
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

441
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:12,235
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

442
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:13,743
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

443
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:16,813
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

444
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,340
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business and piss off.</font>

445
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:22,293
<font color="yellow">You put this woman in danger with your car keys.</font>

446
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:24,955
<font color="yellow">Criminal law code 260 article 1: in the case</font>

448
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:29,985
<font color="yellow">you'll be charged with a special assault offense, so think before you act.</font>

449
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:33,281
<font color="yellow">What are you?</font>

450
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:36,450
<font color="yellow">Would you like me to tell you the law code for</font>

451
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:38,322
<font color="yellow">running away after you damaged her car door?</font>

452
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:40,228
<font color="yellow">I wasn't running away.</font>

453
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:43,853
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

454
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:47,948
<font color="yellow">Contact me after you get the quote from a car center.</font>

455
00:30:58,165 --> 00:30:59,365
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

456
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,056
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

457
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:05,728
<font color="yellow">In such a situation, you shouldn't irritate the person.</font>

458
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,909
<font color="yellow">Next time call your car insurance first.</font>

459
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:09,986
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

460
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:15,790
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saving me.</font>

461
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:18,212
<font color="yellow">It was nothing.</font>

462
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:23,678
<font color="yellow">And I'm sorry about last time. It was my fault.</font>

463
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,780
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past anyways. Don't worry about it.</font>

464
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:32,905
<font color="yellow">I came out today because my mom forced me to,</font>

465
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,910
<font color="yellow">but if you ask me out on a second date, I will accept it.</font>

466
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,429
<font color="yellow">So, for example...</font>

467
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:46,618
<font color="yellow">if you ask me to watch a movie with you, I will.</font>

468
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:53,118
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I have an appointment with a client.</font>

469
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,236
<font color="yellow">What does he mean?</font>

470
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:06,459
<font color="yellow">Is he saying that he doesn't want to watch a movie with me or</font>

471
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:09,712
<font color="yellow">that he has no time right now so that we should meet later on?</font>

472
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:12,327
<font color="yellow">Which one is it?</font>

473
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,712
<font color="yellow">I'm so curious what they'll be doing right now.</font>

474
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,509
<font color="yellow">It's daytime, so they won't be drinking.</font>

475
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:23,694
<font color="yellow">I know. I wonder what they do on blind dates nowadays.</font>

476
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:27,104
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be the same as the old days? Eat and watch a movie?</font>

477
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:31,258
<font color="yellow">But since he's not back yet, I guess they're getting along great!</font>

478
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:38,850
<font color="yellow">Why are you back already?</font>

479
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:41,793
<font color="yellow">Did you just eat with her?</font>

480
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:43,766
<font color="yellow">You should have drank tea, too.</font>

481
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:45,250
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you doing here?</font>

482
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,892
<font color="yellow">Why else would she be here? She couldn't stay home</font>

483
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:49,956
<font color="yellow">because she was curious about your blind date.</font>

484
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:52,927
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't ever do this again.</font>

485
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:55,234
<font color="yellow">I don't want to meet women that way.</font>

486
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:57,303
<font color="yellow">Why not? Did she not like you?</font>

487
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,709
<font color="yellow">You asked her for a second date, but she said no?</font>

488
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:03,514
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm very busy today. Aunt, you can go home early with mom today.</font>

489
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,108
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

490
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,983
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Kim!</font>

491
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,783
<font color="yellow">That woman!</font>

492
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:43,857
<font color="yellow">Father, if there's a document you need, you should tell me or Dal-ho to get it.</font>

493
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:46,778
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do it. It'd be tiring.</font>

494
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:50,736
<font color="yellow">How can I ask you guys to get it when I'm the only one who knows about it?</font>

495
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:52,045
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

496
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:56,913
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, father.</font>

497
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:00,391
<font color="yellow">Good-bye, Mr. Kim.</font>

498
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:07,318
<font color="yellow">Did you catch a rat and eat it?</font>

499
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,131
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

500
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:13,905
<font color="yellow">You're a maid. What's wrong your lipstick color?</font>

501
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:17,253
<font color="yellow">It's bloody red, just like you ate a rat.</font>

502
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:22,308
<font color="yellow">Is there someone you want to look nice for at my house?</font>

503
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:25,028
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

504
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:28,574
<font color="yellow">My daughter gave this lipstick to me, so I tried it on.</font>

505
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,006
<font color="yellow">And I told you so many times not to go into my father's room.</font>

506
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:39,223
<font color="yellow">But you go in whenever you have the chance and even shut the door.</font>

507
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:43,195
<font color="yellow">On top of that, you giggle at everything when you're next to him.</font>

508
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:45,670
<font color="yellow">What are your true intentions?</font>

509
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,831
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by true intentions?</font>

510
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:52,130
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim asked for a cup of tea, so I-</font>

511
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,856
<font color="yellow">I told you to call for me at those times!</font>

512
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:58,842
<font color="yellow">I forgot. I'm sorry.</font>

513
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:01,002
<font color="yellow">It won't happen again.</font>

514
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,009
<font color="yellow">Don't wear that red lipstick at my house!</font>

515
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:06,898
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit you at all!</font>

516
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:17,147
<font color="yellow">I dare her to go into father's room with the door closed again! I'll just fire her!</font>

517
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:21,348
<font color="yellow">She makes me uneasy!</font>

518
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,740
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

519
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:25,821
<font color="yellow">Oh, sweetie!</font>

520
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,084
<font color="yellow">You must have really just ate lunch!</font>

521
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:30,178
<font color="yellow">-Mom. -Yes?</font>

522
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,607
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

523
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,365
<font color="yellow">-Why? -Hurry!</font>

524
00:35:34,647 --> 00:35:35,780
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

525
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,372
<font color="yellow">You asked him to watch a movie?</font>

526
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:43,990
<font color="yellow">Yes, but he didn't give me a clear answer whether he'll watch it or not.</font>

527
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:47,529
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, Hee-Ra! What's wrong with you?</font>

528
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:54,299
<font color="yellow">Did you forget I told you to just eat with him and reject him nicely?</font>

529
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,642
<font color="yellow">I was going to do that at first, too, but out of all the guys</font>

530
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:02,312
<font color="yellow">that I met so far, he seems to be the best one.</font>

531
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:04,212
<font color="yellow">You are out of your mind!</font>

532
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:07,818
<font color="yellow">What's so good about him?</font>

533
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:13,482
<font color="yellow">The pure and honest look in his eyes?</font>

534
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:15,490
<font color="yellow">He's manly.</font>

535
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:20,886
<font color="yellow">Anyways, he's different from the other guys I met so far.</font>

536
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:25,129
<font color="yellow">What in the world are you talking about?</font>

537
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,318
<font color="yellow">He went from rags to riches!</font>

538
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:32,132
<font color="yellow">He has a windowed grandmother, a widowed mother,</font>

539
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,903
<font color="yellow">a divorced aunt, and a jobless brother!</font>

540
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:37,709
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't even look his way!</font>

541
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:40,309
<font color="yellow">Then why did you tell me to meet him?</font>

542
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:42,756
<font color="yellow">Didn't you tell me to meet him because he's a good man?</font>

543
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:48,278
<font color="yellow">Mom, call your friend and ask her what her son</font>

544
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:51,233
<font color="yellow">thinks of me and whether he liked me or not.</font>

545
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:56,482
<font color="yellow">How can you hate all those wealthy men with potential</font>

546
00:36:56,998 --> 00:37:00,196
<font color="yellow">and like empty fools like him instead?</font>

547
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:02,297
<font color="yellow">Your life is going to get messed up!</font>

548
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:03,623
<font color="yellow">Maid!</font>

549
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:07,834
<font color="yellow">Get her a glass of cold water so that she can drink and wake up to reality!</font>

550
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,530
<font color="yellow">God! Mom is no help at all!</font>

551
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:16,803
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

552
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:20,047
<font color="yellow">Her phone number is...</font>

553
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:23,385
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil.</font>

554
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:30,240
<font color="yellow">I've been on quite a few blind dates before,</font>

555
00:37:30,803 --> 00:37:33,537
<font color="yellow">but I have never been the first one to ask the</font>

556
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,302
<font color="yellow">man on a second date to go watch a movie before.</font>

557
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:39,076
<font color="yellow">All right. I understand what you mean.</font>

558
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,971
<font color="yellow">You must have felt very upset.</font>

559
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:50,248
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go didn't answer to your second date request because he doesn't like you.</font>

560
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,177
<font color="yellow">It was because he was shy.</font>

561
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:54,886
<font color="yellow">It didn't seem like that. He seems like the type</font>

562
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:56,807
<font color="yellow">to say what is on his mind. He was manly, too.</font>

563
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:58,225
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

564
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:04,223
<font color="yellow">Oh, well, of course he's manly because he's a man who fights against injustice.</font>

565
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:10,619
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go is a fool when it comes to women.</font>

566
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,780
<font color="yellow">I thought it was because he had a girlfriend.</font>

567
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:19,242
<font color="yellow">Of course not. That's not true at all!</font>

568
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,295
<font color="yellow">To be honest...</font>

569
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:34,897
<font color="yellow">Remember I told you about that weird psycho I met in the parking lot?</font>

570
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:41,996
<font color="yellow">That person was actually Jang-go.</font>

571
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:44,615
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

572
00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:49,825
<font color="yellow">Yes, but truthfully, it was my fault that day.</font>

573
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,439
<font color="yellow">That's why I think Jang-go did that because he's disappointed in me.</font>

574
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,272
<font color="yellow">So that's what happened.</font>

575
00:38:57,006 --> 00:38:59,764
<font color="yellow">I guess it would be a bit iffy then.</font>

576
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:03,438
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is a bit inflexible.</font>

577
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:05,147
<font color="yellow">Right, Ms. Hwang?</font>

578
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:07,899
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a good impression of me. What do I do?</font>

579
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:10,616
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra,</font>

580
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:14,309
<font color="yellow">what do you like about Jang-go?</font>

581
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:24,559
<font color="yellow">Compared to other guys, I think Jang-go is a hot brain.</font>

582
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:26,503
<font color="yellow">Hot brain?</font>

583
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:28,123
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

584
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:29,818
<font color="yellow">A man with a sexy brain.</font>

585
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:34,225
<font color="yellow">He's not just sexy. He's cool sexy.</font>

586
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,123
<font color="yellow">A brain is sexy?</font>

587
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:41,920
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Young people's words are so funny!</font>

588
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:48,308
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra, then let's do this.</font>

589
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:54,831
<font color="yellow">I'll talk about you nicely to Jang-go, so you just capture his heart!</font>

590
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:59,009
<font color="yellow">How a man act depends on the woman.</font>

591
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,042
<font color="yellow">This is the address of his office.</font>

592
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:08,574
<font color="yellow">Go and visit him.</font>

593
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,232
<font color="yellow">(Seoul Law Office. Lawyer: Lee Jang-go.)</font>

594
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:14,988
<font color="yellow">This is my grandfather's building!</font>

595
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:17,584
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! Are you serious?</font>

596
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:20,779
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! What kind of fate is this?</font>

597
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:25,945
<font color="yellow">I didn't know Jang-go's office was in your grandfather's building!</font>

598
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:29,527
<font color="yellow">She is the phoenix.</font>

599
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:33,512
<font color="yellow">The phoenix came in first. I should never chase it out.</font>

600
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:41,732
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I really like Hee-Ra!</font>

601
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:47,263
<font color="yellow">I only talked with her for a short while, but she was so cute and pretty!</font>

602
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:50,408
<font color="yellow">But if such a pretty girl asked him to go watch</font>

603
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:52,710
<font color="yellow">a movie, he should have quickly said yes.</font>

604
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,112
<font color="yellow">Why would he say no and hurt her pride?</font>

605
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:57,303
<font color="yellow">I know!</font>

606
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:03,544
<font color="yellow">It's my friend Chung-ja.</font>

607
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,357
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and answer it!</font>

608
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:08,508
<font color="yellow">Hi, Chung-ja.</font>

609
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:15,232
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I feel so bad about what happened with our kids today.</font>

610
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,684
<font color="yellow">Huh? What do you mean?</font>

611
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:26,334
<font color="yellow">My daughter said that your son is not her style.</font>

612
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:31,162
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra said she doesn't like Jang-go?</font>

613
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:32,897
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

614
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,217
<font color="yellow">Yes, Geum-sil.</font>

615
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,244
<font color="yellow">I guess we're not fated to be in-laws.</font>

616
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,917
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, are you listening to me?</font>

617
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:50,174
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad.</font>

618
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,842
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

619
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:56,258
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll talk to you later.</font>

620
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:00,887
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, what was that?</font>

621
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:03,656
<font color="yellow">You just met Hee-Ra.</font>

622
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,314
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja just forced her daughter to meet</font>

623
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:08,669
<font color="yellow">Jang-go because I asked her to let them meet.</font>

624
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:12,164
<font color="yellow">She acted all high and mighty because she has some</font>

625
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:14,204
<font color="yellow">inheritance. In other words, she took us as fools.</font>

626
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:16,918
<font color="yellow">Your friend is really ridiculous.</font>

627
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,107
<font color="yellow">But there is no parent who wins over her child.</font>

628
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,607
<font color="yellow">She likes Jang-go, so what will her mom do about it?</font>

629
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

630
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:48,656
<font color="yellow">Hello, sir.</font>

631
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:51,089
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mi-poong, are you going on a delivery?</font>

632
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,436
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

633
00:42:52,662 --> 00:42:56,331
<font color="yellow">But why is this sewing machine outside?</font>

634
00:42:56,881 --> 00:43:00,261
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm getting rid of it because I'm getting a new one.</font>

635
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:02,068
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

636
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,558
<font color="yellow">Then may I take this?</font>

637
00:43:05,037 --> 00:43:06,037
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

638
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:09,389
<font color="yellow">It's a bit old though, so you'll have to fix it.</font>

639
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:11,255
<font color="yellow">You might have to grease it up, too.</font>

640
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:13,996
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter. Thank you, sir.</font>

641
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:16,106
<font color="yellow">I'll come pick it up after I'm done with work.</font>

642
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:30,951
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

643
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,384
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

644
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,828
<font color="yellow">You came out of nowhere! I almost had a heart attack!</font>

645
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:40,856
<font color="yellow">I did it on purpose so that you can have a heart attack. So what?</font>

646
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:42,825
<font color="yellow">I'll get you back later.</font>

647
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:44,536
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

648
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:47,149
<font color="yellow">But what is this? Why is it so heavy?</font>

649
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:49,161
<font color="yellow">It's a sewing machine.</font>

650
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:51,381
<font color="yellow">A sewing machine? You know how to use one?</font>

651
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:54,076
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's a piece of cake!</font>

652
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:58,274
<font color="yellow">When I was in Pyeongyang, I made my dance costumes all by myself.</font>

653
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,900
<font color="yellow">You know how to make clothes?</font>

654
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,668
<font color="yellow">A little tadpole like you?</font>

655
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,241
<font color="yellow">Wow. I can't believe this at all.</font>

656
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,905
<font color="yellow">Then don't.</font>

657
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:09,829
<font color="yellow">I never asked you to believe me.</font>

658
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:13,027
<font color="yellow">And that was a long time ago.</font>

659
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,512
<font color="yellow">Do you still see me as a little tadpole?</font>

660
00:44:16,638 --> 00:44:18,531
<font color="yellow">You should get your eyes checked out.</font>

661
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,813
<font color="yellow">You need to wear glasses.</font>

662
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,768
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, why are you coming from there?</font>

663
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:41,067
<font color="yellow">I wanted to check if they moved in well.</font>

664
00:44:41,568 --> 00:44:44,661
<font color="yellow">Why would you care about them? Grandma already checked on them.</font>

665
00:44:49,177 --> 00:44:55,542
<font color="yellow">But Jang-go, Hee-Ra seemed to have liked you.</font>

666
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,929
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jang-go.</font>

667
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,841
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

668
00:45:03,896 --> 00:45:06,271
<font color="yellow">Why don't you like her, huh?</font>

669
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:09,108
<font color="yellow">She's amiable and pretty. She studied abroad as well.</font>

670
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,753
<font color="yellow">She's perfect for you!</font>

671
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,552
<font color="yellow">How is she perfect for me?</font>

672
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,038
<font color="yellow">I don't think so. So why did you arrange such a meeting?</font>

673
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,821
<font color="yellow">Do you think I did that because I had nothing else to do?</font>

674
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:24,196
<font color="yellow">If you want to become a successful lawyer, you need sturdy connections.</font>

675
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:26,661
<font color="yellow">But we have neither money nor connections.</font>

676
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:30,502
<font color="yellow">But later on, Hee-Ra will receive a tremendous inheritance.</font>

677
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:33,759
<font color="yellow">If you became the son-in-law of such a house, you won't have to</font>

678
00:45:33,784 --> 00:45:36,389
<font color="yellow">be seduced by temptations, and you can work as much as you want!</font>

679
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:39,372
<font color="yellow">If it's for such a condition, then I really don't want to be with her.</font>

680
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,610
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, men must meet good women. That's why I did this!</font>

681
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:46,644
<font color="yellow">Just meet her one more time.</font>

682
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,497
<font color="yellow">How can you judge someone after just meeting them once?</font>

683
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:50,708
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

684
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:55,009
<font color="yellow">Do you not like Hee-Ra because of the parking lot incidence?</font>

685
00:45:56,013 --> 00:45:58,230
<font color="yellow">I heard all about that.</font>

686
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,597
<font color="yellow">But do you know what she said?</font>

687
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:03,200
<font color="yellow">She said it was her fault.</font>

688
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:05,822
<font color="yellow">She's cool and doesn't hold any grudges.</font>

689
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:10,638
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm sorry, but no is no.</font>

690
00:46:12,021 --> 00:46:14,314
<font color="yellow">I don't want to fight with you about this.</font>

691
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,278
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wash.</font>

692
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,770
<font color="yellow">Oh, that stubborn fool!</font>

693
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,824
<font color="yellow">I have two sons, but why are they both not listening to me?</font>

694
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,389
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't he like her?</font>

695
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,003
<font color="yellow">-Hey, Lee Jang-soo! -Song Joo-ri!</font>

696
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:01,685
<font color="yellow">Song Joo-ri!</font>

697
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,353
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri, where were you?</font>

698
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:09,190
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried I was?</font>

699
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:12,321
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer your phone? Did you want to see me go mad?</font>

700
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:15,731
<font color="yellow">And who is that man? Huh?</font>

701
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,068
<font color="yellow">He's the father of my kids.</font>

702
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:20,771
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

703
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:23,020
<font color="yellow">I decided to get back together with him.</font>

704
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,696
<font color="yellow">So, Jang-soo, you go your own way.</font>

705
00:47:29,232 --> 00:47:31,448
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking so much? Let's go.</font>

706
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:36,630
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri, are you crazy? You divorced him because he cheats on you, beats you,</font>

707
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:39,989
<font color="yellow">and never gives you money! But you want to get back together with this bastard?</font>

708
00:47:40,014 --> 00:47:41,014
<font color="yellow">You little!</font>

709
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:45,416
<font color="yellow">You're dead today!</font>

710
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,083
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

711
00:48:00,108 --> 00:48:03,498
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Why would you hit my husband?</font>

712
00:48:03,537 --> 00:48:06,555
<font color="yellow">Are you insane? How can you just beat him?</font>

713
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,851
<font color="yellow">Who are you to hit him?</font>

714
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:09,708
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

715
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:11,014
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt?</font>

716
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:12,283
<font color="yellow">He bit me!</font>

717
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,107
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri.</font>

718
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,732
<font color="yellow">Don't appear in front of me ever again!</font>

719
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:19,013
<font color="yellow">Go! Hurry up!</font>

720
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:20,373
<font color="yellow">Those jerks!</font>

721
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:23,679
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, are you okay? Did you get hurt a lot?</font>

722
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:27,479
<font color="yellow">You fool! Why did you fall for her?</font>

723
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,746
<font color="yellow">Joo-ri, I'm sorry!</font>

724
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:32,989
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

725
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:39,559
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, why would you cry?</font>

726
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:42,128
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't shed tears for such a nasty woman!</font>

727
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,759
<font color="yellow">Go! Go!</font>

728
00:48:46,388 --> 00:48:48,111
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you got beaten up. Go!</font>

729
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,317
<font color="yellow">I'm done making the curtains!</font>

730
00:49:19,935 --> 00:49:20,935
<font color="yellow">Peek-a-boo!</font>

731
00:49:21,201 --> 00:49:22,984
<font color="yellow">Is it really all done now?</font>

732
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,985
<font color="yellow">Stand up and hold this.</font>

733
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:31,377
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's pretty!</font>

734
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:34,903
<font color="yellow">Grandma, aunt is done making the curtains!</font>

735
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:39,762
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! It's beautiful!</font>

736
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:42,108
<font color="yellow">Mom, what do you think? Do you like it?</font>

737
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:43,348
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

738
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:46,317
<font color="yellow">It's a very nice curtain.</font>

739
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:49,050
<font color="yellow">Grandma, what's that smell?</font>

740
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:53,513
<font color="yellow">This smells like burning mung bean pancakes.</font>

741
00:49:55,294 --> 00:49:56,294
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear!</font>

742
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:07,365
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

743
00:50:07,662 --> 00:50:08,662
<font color="yellow">-Yes. -Yes.</font>

744
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:13,184
<font color="yellow">Eat a lot. There's more.</font>

745
00:50:21,662 --> 00:50:23,102
<font color="yellow">Where are you taking those?</font>

746
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:27,668
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give them to the owner's house, and I want to say hi to her as well.</font>

747
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:32,353
<font color="yellow">We met the grandmother, but we need to say hi to the other family members as well.</font>

748
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:33,724
<font color="yellow">Stay here and eat with Yoo-sung.</font>

749
00:50:34,122 --> 00:50:35,272
<font color="yellow">I'll go with you.</font>

750
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:36,529
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

751
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,986
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then let's all go and say hi.</font>

752
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:48,599
<font color="yellow">How embarrassing.</font>

753
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:53,199
<font color="yellow">How can you cry after being dumped by such a nasty woman?</font>

754
00:50:53,482 --> 00:50:55,115
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated!</font>

755
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,215
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault!</font>

756
00:50:57,552 --> 00:51:00,012
<font color="yellow">Mom. Aunt. Grandma.</font>

757
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,627
<font color="yellow">Go and tell Joo-ri that you allow her to be with me.</font>

758
00:51:04,652 --> 00:51:07,193
<font color="yellow">I can't live without Joo-ri!</font>

759
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:09,292
<font color="yellow">Mom! Grandma!</font>

760
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:12,724
<font color="yellow">Just die!</font>

761
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:15,466
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom! Mom!</font>

762
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:28,384
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

763
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:30,780
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

764
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:35,528
<font color="yellow">What did her son do so wrong that she's beating him like he's a dog?</font>

765
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:37,913
<font color="yellow">Use your words!</font>

766
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:40,373
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

767
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,933
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I'm scared.</font>

768
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,425
<font color="yellow">Okay. This won't do. Let's go home.</font>

769
00:51:49,216 --> 00:51:50,521
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, come here.</font>

770
00:51:53,169 --> 00:51:56,477
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, what are you doing? Hurry up and come here!</font>

771
00:52:03,068 --> 00:52:05,687
<font color="yellow">That owner must have a bad temper.</font>

772
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:09,930
<font color="yellow">How can she beat her son like that?</font>

773
00:52:10,763 --> 00:52:16,392
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, did we move into the right place? This looks like a strange house.</font>

774
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:19,083
<font color="yellow">There must be something we don't know about.</font>

775
00:52:19,818 --> 00:52:20,818
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

776
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:26,513
<font color="yellow">But it seems like the owner has many more family members than just the grandmother.</font>

777
00:52:26,873 --> 00:52:30,870
<font color="yellow">There was one man who called her "mom," so it seems like she has another son.</font>

778
00:52:34,974 --> 00:52:36,041
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

779
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,746
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

780
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:19,388
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

781
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:22,116
<font color="yellow">There's no point in pretending you're asleep.</font>

782
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:30,842
<font color="yellow">It's obvious that you're just pretending to be asleep.</font>

783
00:53:33,068 --> 00:53:34,468
<font color="yellow">What do you want now?</font>

784
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,653
<font color="yellow">I'm suspicious about the maid.</font>

785
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:45,323
<font color="yellow">When I'm not around, she wears red lipstick and goes into father's room.</font>

786
00:53:45,545 --> 00:53:46,747
<font color="yellow">That again?</font>

787
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,393
<font color="yellow">When the maid is old, you say she's suspicious because she's old.</font>

788
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:53,599
<font color="yellow">When the maid is young, you say she's suspicious because she's young.</font>

789
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:56,716
<font color="yellow">Elder is 88 years old right now.</font>

790
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:59,620
<font color="yellow">There's nothing suspicious going on at all.</font>

791
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:02,716
<font color="yellow">There are many middle-aged gold diggers lately.</font>

792
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,101
<font color="yellow">They seduce wealthy old men, get their inheritance</font>

793
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:08,529
<font color="yellow">when they get dementia, and then throw them away.</font>

794
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:10,901
<font color="yellow">Don't you watch the news?</font>

795
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:14,418
<font color="yellow">So what do you want me to do about it?</font>

796
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:17,032
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

797
00:54:17,677 --> 00:54:20,770
<font color="yellow">If Elder meets a good woman, I'm going to clap for him.</font>

798
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:23,485
<font color="yellow">It would be a great thing if he can live happily</font>

799
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,514
<font color="yellow">with the woman he loves before he passes away.</font>

800
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:27,739
<font color="yellow">You're crazy. For whose happiness?</font>

801
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:30,070
<font color="yellow">Do you really mean that?</font>

802
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,643
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

803
00:54:33,294 --> 00:54:35,666
<font color="yellow">How can you have such foul thoughts?</font>

804
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:41,192
<font color="yellow">When father gets married, it's the end for us!</font>

805
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:45,585
<font color="yellow">The wrong catch! A pitiable condition!</font>

806
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:47,076
<font color="yellow">Don't you know?</font>

807
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:49,389
<font color="yellow">Enough with that crap!</font>

808
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:51,249
<font color="yellow">Get out of the way!</font>

809
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:55,802
<font color="yellow">You're the one who is talking crap right now!</font>

810
00:54:56,662 --> 00:55:01,932
<font color="yellow">I can allow everything else, but I will not allow father to get re-married!</font>

811
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:05,340
<font color="yellow">He better not get re-married.</font>

812
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:07,849
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong!</font>

813
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:10,865
<font color="yellow">Over here!</font>

814
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,740
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

815
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:16,044
<font color="yellow">Give those to me.</font>

816
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:17,848
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

817
00:56:18,396 --> 00:56:22,677
<font color="yellow">I can't stay in the sauna any longer.</font>

818
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,484
<font color="yellow">I feel so suffocated!</font>

819
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:28,606
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to find a nearby motel for you?</font>

820
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:29,631
<font color="yellow">Oh, no!</font>

821
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:33,427
<font color="yellow">Motels are scary, Hee-dong.</font>

822
00:57:34,779 --> 00:57:38,544
<font color="yellow">Goodness! I feel like I'm alive now!</font>

823
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:44,465
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I'll find a good timing to talk to mom about you.</font>

824
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:46,427
<font color="yellow">So you know...?</font>

825
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:48,059
<font color="yellow">I know. I know.</font>

826
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:51,149
<font color="yellow">When I get caught, I'll get kicked out.</font>

827
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:55,796
<font color="yellow">I'll bring you your meals, so be careful when you use the bathroom.</font>

828
00:57:56,216 --> 00:57:58,106
<font color="yellow">If Hee-Ra finds out, it'd be troublesome.</font>

829
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:00,263
<font color="yellow">I know Hee-Ra has a big mouth.</font>

830
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:06,427
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep on the floor, so sleep comfortably on the bed.</font>

831
00:58:07,419 --> 00:58:09,105
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

832
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:11,838
<font color="yellow">Oh, my baby.</font>

833
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:16,308
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I carried you on my back and raised you when you were this small.</font>

834
00:58:23,505 --> 00:58:25,511
<font color="yellow">Grandma, here.</font>

835
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,383
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

836
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:28,436
<font color="yellow">It's just a similar woman.</font>

837
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:31,640
<font color="yellow">How could she be here when she's in North Korea?</font>

838
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:38,544
<font color="yellow">(Lawyer Lee Jang-go)</font>

839
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:42,333
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go home after I send these at the post office.</font>

840
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:44,141
<font color="yellow">Okay, see you at home.</font>

841
00:59:44,357 --> 00:59:45,357
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

842
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:55,702
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra, what are you doing here?</font>

843
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:58,458
<font color="yellow">This is my grandfather's building.</font>

844
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:00,302
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by.</font>

845
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:02,154
<font color="yellow">Hee-Ra?</font>

846
01:00:02,763 --> 01:00:05,466
<font color="yellow">The girl you met last time is her?</font>

847
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:08,640
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Jo Hee-Ra.</font>

848
01:00:09,998 --> 01:00:13,110
<font color="yellow">I'm Jang-go's aunt.</font>

849
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:15,332
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see!</font>

850
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,113
<font color="yellow">Then go ahead and talk! I was just on my way out.</font>

851
01:00:32,427 --> 01:00:36,427
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, Hee-Ra came to Jang-go's office just now!</font>

852
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:39,146
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

853
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:40,171
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

854
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:43,269
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, she looks so pretty and cute!</font>

855
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,044
<font color="yellow">I told you so!</font>

856
01:00:45,638 --> 01:00:49,098
<font color="yellow">She must really like Jang-go! She came all the way to his office.</font>

857
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:51,805
<font color="yellow">Eavesdrop on them.</font>

858
01:00:52,576 --> 01:00:54,621
<font color="yellow">Okay! I'm so curious, too!</font>

859
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,457
<font color="yellow">You didn't ask me out on a second date, so I thought you had rejected me.</font>

860
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,983
<font color="yellow">But your mother said that you just didn't know how to express yourself very well.</font>

861
01:01:10,677 --> 01:01:11,818
<font color="yellow">My mother said that?</font>

862
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:13,326
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

863
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:17,645
<font color="yellow">If you ask me to go watch a movie,</font>

864
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,623
<font color="yellow">I'll still go watch it with you.</font>

865
01:01:24,326 --> 01:01:25,326
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

866
01:01:25,778 --> 01:01:28,442
<font color="yellow">I think there was a misunderstanding between my mother and me.</font>

867
01:01:28,677 --> 01:01:31,679
<font color="yellow">I don't have any time or will to be in this kind of relationship.</font>

868
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:34,592
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that...</font>

869
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:41,138
<font color="yellow">you don't want to go out with me?</font>

870
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,099
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

871
01:01:45,177 --> 01:01:47,714
<font color="yellow">I understand what you mean.</font>

872
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,948
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, are you serious?</font>

873
01:01:56,372 --> 01:02:00,779
<font color="yellow">I was so flabbergasted. Hee-ra's pride must have been really hurt.</font>

874
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,862
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

875
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:08,462
<font color="yellow">Does Jang-go have a girlfriend?</font>

876
01:02:09,412 --> 01:02:11,065
<font color="yellow">Or else how could he do this?</font>

877
01:02:11,763 --> 01:02:14,742
<font color="yellow">No way. That can't be.</font>

878
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:17,591
<font color="yellow">Okay, Nam-yi.</font>

879
01:02:22,115 --> 01:02:23,916
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

880
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:39,170
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, get in.</font>

881
01:02:40,474 --> 01:02:42,849
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I'm almost there.</font>

882
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:44,466
<font color="yellow">Just get in.</font>

883
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:46,593
<font color="yellow">If you don't get in, I won't go.</font>

884
01:02:47,623 --> 01:02:49,490
<font color="yellow">What kind of threat is that?</font>

885
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:52,600
<font color="yellow">How can I go alone when I saw you walking?</font>

886
01:02:53,685 --> 01:02:54,961
<font color="yellow">Get in. It's my order.</font>

887
01:02:57,115 --> 01:02:58,115
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

888
01:03:24,005 --> 01:03:25,716
<font color="yellow">Jang-go must have come home already.</font>

889
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:33,982
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Who is that girl?</font>

890
01:03:47,412 --> 01:03:49,006
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, we're in big trouble!</font>

891
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,666
<font color="yellow">Why? What's wrong?</font>

892
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:54,638
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I was right! Jang-go has a girlfriend!</font>

893
01:03:54,927 --> 01:03:57,746
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? That's not true.</font>

894
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:00,294
<font color="yellow">Just like Jang-soo, he's bringing her home to introduce</font>

895
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,529
<font color="yellow">her because we keep telling him to go on blind dates.</font>

896
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:04,271
<font color="yellow">That can't be, Nam-yi!</font>

897
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:07,309
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense when there's a girl like Hee-Ra around!</font>

898
01:04:07,623 --> 01:04:09,674
<font color="yellow">You must have made a mistake.</font>

899
01:04:10,826 --> 01:04:14,488
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, Jang-go is entering our house right now with a girl!</font>

900
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:16,615
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

901
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,928
