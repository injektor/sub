is a distant uncle and nephew...</font>

now instead of just playing pretend!</font>

00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:10,852
<font color="yellow">She's an ungrateful brat that
is worse than beasts!</font>

152
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:19,304
<font color="yellow">Then how did you come here
from China without any money?</font>

153
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:22,536
<font color="yellow">How did we survive?</font>

154
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,819
<font color="yellow">How did we survive and
end up coming here?</font>

155
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,433
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

156
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:32,852
<font color="yellow">tell you that...</font>

157
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:37,051
<font color="yellow">until I die.</font>

158
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:40,922
<font color="yellow">Not until I die...</font>

159
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:29,198
<font color="yellow">- Thank you! Come back next time!
- Good-bye.</font>

160
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:37,714
<font color="yellow">Ever since you came to our store as
a manager, the sales has gone up a lot.</font>

161
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,292
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

162
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:44,589
<font color="yellow">Even if rude customers come,
you still treat them kindly.</font>

163
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,519
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

164
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,557
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of things here,
so go home first.</font>

165
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:58,198
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

166
00:14:58,223 --> 00:14:59,223
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

167
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:05,269
<font color="yellow">- Then I'll go home first.
- Bye. See you tomorrow.</font>

168
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:06,785
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

169
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:37,175
<font color="yellow">Is that man really the second son of
Daelhyeong Group? Are you sure?</font>

170
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,511
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

171
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:50,596
<font color="yellow">If things work out, I'll pay you more.</font>

172
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,118
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good luck, Shin-ae.</font>

173
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,379
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

174
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

175
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,730
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

176
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:29,541
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. My heels must have
been too high, so I tripped.</font>

177
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:30,574
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

178
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,402
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

179
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:41,417
<font color="yellow">You didn't do it on purpose.</font>

180
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:48,696
<font color="yellow">If it's all right with you, I would like to
fill up your wine glass that I emptied.</font>

181
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:51,644
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

182
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,518
<font color="yellow">Hey. You're here.</font>

183
00:16:57,394 --> 00:16:59,605
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. My girlfriend is here.</font>

184
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,753
<font color="yellow">Oh, all right.</font>

185
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,392
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

186
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:50,626
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

187
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:02,876
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

188
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:08,925
<font color="yellow">Oh, I wasn't doing that on purpose...</font>

189
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,614
<font color="yellow">I was trying to get out of your way.</font>

190
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:49,517
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

191
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,146
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

192
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:58,333
<font color="yellow">They're taking all of my money.</font>

193
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,508
<font color="yellow">You can't get blood from a stone.</font>

194
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:15,187
<font color="yellow">Where were you?</font>

195
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:17,607
<font color="yellow">Were you in father's room?</font>

196
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,882
<font color="yellow">No words can justify my actions.</font>

197
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:39,554
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't be this angry at me
if I had confessed to you earlier.</font>

198
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:52,122
<font color="yellow">Like I told father before, I swear
I didn't use that money for no good.</font>

199
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,419
<font color="yellow">You believe me, don't you?</font>

200
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,340
<font color="yellow">Turn the lights off.</font>

201
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,966
<font color="yellow">And I'll never drink
and throw a fit again.</font>

202
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:05,232
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

203
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,192
<font color="yellow">But what did father say?</font>

204
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,732
<font color="yellow">What did you two talk about for so long?</font>

205
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:17,263
<font color="yellow">I said turn the lights off!</font>

206
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,380
<font color="yellow">Okay, honey.</font>

207
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,068
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

208
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,621
<font color="yellow">Of course! I'm perfectly fine!</font>

209
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:05,334
<font color="yellow">This won't do. Hold onto me.</font>

210
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:07,222
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

211
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,762
<font color="yellow">Do I look drunk to you?</font>

212
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:15,318
<font color="yellow">I'm not the type of woman to lose
to a few glasses of soju!</font>

213
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,076
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

214
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,374
<font color="yellow">Who could overcome your stubbornness?</font>

215
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,846
<font color="yellow">If you fall, you'll scrape
your knee, not mine.</font>

216
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,975
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Isn't that Jang-go?</font>

217
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:57,849
<font color="yellow">But why does he keep hanging out
with that North Korean girl?</font>

218
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:00,926
<font color="yellow">Did they drink together?</font>

219
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,053
<font color="yellow">You just came home?</font>

220
00:23:09,428 --> 00:23:10,428
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

221
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:13,752
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

222
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:17,459
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

223
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,591
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep hanging out with her?</font>

224
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:22,357
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do
if your mom finds out?</font>

225
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:24,490
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

226
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:27,990
<font color="yellow">She had a bad day, so I drank with her.</font>

227
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:30,828
<font color="yellow">So why would you drink with her?</font>

228
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,335
<font color="yellow">What does her having
a bad day have to do with you?</font>

229
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:37,027
<font color="yellow">What's so bad about neighbors
having a drink together?</font>

230
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:39,381
<font color="yellow">Neighbors, my foot.</font>

231
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:44,115
<font color="yellow">What if she starts sticking around you?</font>

232
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,382
<font color="yellow">Aunt, how can you say that?</font>

233
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,568
<font color="yellow">You should be glad I was the one
who saw you guys. If it was</font>

234
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:53,158
<font color="yellow">your mom, she would've kicked
them out right away. You know?</font>

235
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,386
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing out here?</font>

236
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,337
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, why are you outside?</font>

237
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,250
<font color="yellow">I was just getting some fresh air.</font>

238
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,764
<font color="yellow">Give me that. I'll throw it away.</font>

239
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:10,255
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
Did something happen at work?</font>

240
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,387
<font color="yellow">No, of course not.</font>

241
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil...</font>

242
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:18,826
<font color="yellow">Never mind. It's nothing.</font>

243
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:24,894
<font color="yellow">Why did she stop talking?</font>

244
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:26,920
<font color="yellow">That was weird.</font>

245
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:37,224
<font color="yellow">What's this? It's the jackpot!</font>

246
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,333
<font color="yellow">It's not green vegetable juice today.</font>

247
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,792
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I mixed wood-cultivated
ginseng with honey.</font>

248
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:12,607
<font color="yellow">It's for my father-in-law.</font>

249
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:14,474
<font color="yellow">You just made one glass?</font>

250
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,738
<font color="yellow">Can't you make one more glass for me?</font>

251
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:20,662
<font color="yellow">Come on, mom. Just wait a little bit.</font>

252
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,043
<font color="yellow">I'll get you real ginseng.</font>

253
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,655
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

254
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,613
<font color="yellow">Geez. Wood-cultivated ginseng
doesn't cost much anyways.</font>

255
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:41,569
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

256
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,697
<font color="yellow">Drink this, father.
It's wood-cultivated ginseng juice.</font>

257
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:51,521
<font color="yellow">I put enough honey in it,
so it should be easy to drink.</font>

258
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:54,014
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

259
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:11,138
<font color="yellow">Sit here.</font>

260
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:12,775
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

261
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:20,133
<font color="yellow">It's $60,000.</font>

262
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:22,166
<font color="yellow">Pay back your debt with this.</font>

263
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:24,506
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

264
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,053
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja,</font>

265
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:31,668
<font color="yellow">make sure something like
this never happens again.</font>

266
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:33,202
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>

267
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:34,811
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

268
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:39,050
<font color="yellow">This will never happen again.</font>

269
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:42,772
<font color="yellow">Thank you, father.</font>

270
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,279
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, father.</font>

271
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:52,590
<font color="yellow">Here. This is the $45,000
I borrowed from you.</font>

272
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:59,497
<font color="yellow">Thanks for paying back without
dragging this out any longer.</font>

273
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,176
<font color="yellow">You didn't get another
private loan, did you?</font>

274
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:08,655
<font color="yellow">You must think we're on the same level
just because I didn't have enough living</font>

275
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,183
<font color="yellow">expenses for the time being and had to
borrow a small sum of money from you.</font>

276
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:14,823
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, you're going
to have a difficult</font>

277
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:17,297
<font color="yellow">time living in this world
without much tact.</font>

278
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:19,686
<font color="yellow">Level, my foot.</font>

279
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:23,311
<font color="yellow">Is that the brand name of an underwear
being sold at Dongdaemun?</font>

280
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,139
<font color="yellow">You can't say that when you're going
around borrowing small sums of money.</font>

281
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:29,725
<font color="yellow">It's the correct amount.</font>

282
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:32,775
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to say this,</font>

283
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:36,702
<font color="yellow">but Geum-sil,</font>

284
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:39,282
<font color="yellow">you're barking up the wrong tree.</font>

285
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:44,180
<font color="yellow">You must be trying to do something
with your son's title as a lawyer,</font>

286
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,092
<font color="yellow">but the world is overflowing
with lawyers lately.</font>

287
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:51,329
<font color="yellow">You better not pull
this kind of stunt again.</font>

288
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,478
<font color="yellow">It's my last warning as your friend.</font>

289
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:58,923
<font color="yellow">Then let me give you
one last warning as a friend.</font>

290
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:05,202
<font color="yellow">You must be acting like this
because of your Elder's inheritance.</font>

291
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,560
<font color="yellow">That isn't the inheritance
you worked hard to</font>

292
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,547
<font color="yellow">make and it's not from
your parents either.</font>

293
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:15,806
<font color="yellow">It's the inheritance from your distant relative.
Aren't you being too stubborn?</font>

294
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,117
<font color="yellow">You never know what will happen.</font>

295
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,087
<font color="yellow">Your Elder's blood relatives
could pop out of nowhere.</font>

296
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,940
<font color="yellow">Or your Elder can give all of his inheritance
away to charity before he dies.</font>

297
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:31,814
<font color="yellow">So don't count your chickens
before they hatch.</font>

298
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:33,751
<font color="yellow">You'll get disappointed.</font>

299
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:38,295
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the warning, but you don't
have to worry about such a thing.</font>

300
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:43,360
<font color="yellow">My husband is going to
become Elder's adoptive son.</font>

301
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,246
<font color="yellow">Adoptive son?</font>

302
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:50,021
<font color="yellow">We're not just relatives anymore.
We're going to be a parent and children.</font>

303
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,182
<font color="yellow">No one will say anything
if we get Elder's inheritance now.</font>

304
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:55,715
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

305
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,275
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I'll live according
to my standards now,</font>

306
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:04,582
<font color="yellow">so you should live according
to your standards, too.</font>

307
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:07,720
<font color="yellow">We don't have any more reason
to see each other now, right?</font>

308
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:56,192
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! Oh, no! What do I do?</font>

309
00:29:57,512 --> 00:30:01,289
<font color="yellow">You little brat! Who told you that
you could do something like this here?</font>

310
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:06,848
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung.</font>

311
00:30:07,363 --> 00:30:08,363
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung.</font>

312
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:11,207
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

313
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:15,466
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
Why are you yelling at him?</font>

314
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,344
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

315
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:19,929
<font color="yellow">Can't you see this?</font>

316
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:22,050
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about this?</font>

317
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,775
<font color="yellow">This bean paste has
been stored for years now.</font>

318
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:32,543
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, did you do that?</font>

319
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,866
<font color="yellow">How can he come around here
and do something like this when you</font>

320
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,099
<font color="yellow">guys are living here without
even paying the security deposit?</font>

321
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:47,388
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about this?
Don't you people have any</font>

322
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:50,121
<font color="yellow">conscience? What are you going
to do about my bean paste?</font>

323
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:52,977
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

324
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:58,706
<font color="yellow">If you're careful with the broken pieces,
I don't think you have to throw it all away.</font>

325
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,639
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. I'll clean it up right away.
- Forget it!</font>

326
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:05,698
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to see you
right now. Take that kid</font>

327
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:08,532
<font color="yellow">and get out of here.
Get out of here this instant!</font>

328
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:12,691
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

329
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:26,355
<font color="yellow">What do I do about
this bean paste? Oh my god.</font>

330
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:29,593
<font color="yellow">Will we still be able to eat
if I take the broken parts out?</font>

331
00:31:32,082 --> 00:31:33,750
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset!</font>

332
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:36,277
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

333
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:46,297
<font color="yellow">Who told you to play ball in the owner's yard?
Huh? Who told you that you can do that?</font>

334
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:48,212
<font color="yellow">Answer me!</font>

335
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:50,430
<font color="yellow">Who told you that you can do that?</font>

336
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:53,504
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, grandma.</font>

337
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:57,648
<font color="yellow">I'll never do that again, grandma.</font>

338
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,099
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me, grandma.</font>

339
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,371
<font color="yellow">I don't like you. I don't like you!</font>

340
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:12,465
<font color="yellow">I hate you!</font>

341
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,043
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

342
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,519
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung...</font>

343
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:37,186
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Yoo-sung.</font>

344
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,601
<font color="yellow">No. No, Yoo-sung. It's all my fault.</font>

345
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,652
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault, Yoo-sung.</font>

346
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,827
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, it's okay.</font>

347
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,175
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung.</font>

348
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,563
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Yoo-sung.</font>

349
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:20,504
<font color="yellow">I was thinking of officially
adopting you as my son.</font>

350
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:29,879
<font color="yellow">Father,</font>

351
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:35,909
<font color="yellow">tell me what I'm supposed to do.</font>

352
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:59,894
<font color="yellow">So have you thought
about what I told you?</font>

353
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:02,441
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

354
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:04,222
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

355
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:07,948
<font color="yellow">Talk comfortably.</font>

356
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:11,892
<font color="yellow">There's nothing
we can't tell each other.</font>

357
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:17,037
<font color="yellow">Then I'll tell you my honest thoughts.</font>

358
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:18,438
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

359
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,695
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to do anything you want-</font>

360
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,934
<font color="yellow">Deok-cheon! Deok-cheon!</font>

361
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,296
<font color="yellow">- Deok-cheon, are you here?
- What is it?</font>

362
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:29,321
<font color="yellow">- Deok-cheon!
- He's over there.</font>

363
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:31,906
<font color="yellow">Oh! Deok-cheon!</font>

364
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:34,272
<font color="yellow">Oh, Kyung-sik.</font>

365
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,297
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

366
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,322
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

367
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:40,351
<font color="yellow">So you were here.</font>

368
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:41,695
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

369
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,853
<font color="yellow">Look, Deok-cheon.</font>

370
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:46,491
<font color="yellow">Don't get surprised
after you hear what I tell you.</font>

371
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:53,487
<font color="yellow">You went to meet your younger cousin
in China. What's all the fuss about suddenly?</font>

372
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:58,425
<font color="yellow">Do you remember Kyung-sook
who used to live in our village?</font>

373
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:02,120
<font color="yellow">Ms. Soon-cheol's daughter Jo Kyung-sook?</font>

374
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:08,218
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

375
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:13,951
<font color="yellow">About twenty years ago, my younger cousin
coincidentally ran into Kyung-sook.</font>

376
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:19,303
<font color="yellow">Kyung-sook said she saw your wife</font>

377
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:24,171
<font color="yellow">in Gaeseong in the summer you escaped.</font>

378
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:28,021
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

379
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,144
<font color="yellow">As soon as I had escaped,
my family were assassinated</font>

380
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:37,179
<font color="yellow">by soldiers during
the Third Battle of Seoul.</font>

381
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:45,858
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense that she saw
my dead wife a few months after that?</font>

382
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:47,340
<font color="yellow">He's right, sir.</font>

383
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:53,252
<font color="yellow">We heard that there were
no survivors in both our families.</font>

384
00:35:53,413 --> 00:35:59,966
<font color="yellow">Yes, but your wife's brother
had only taken your wife away.</font>

385
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,272
<font color="yellow">She had cried saying that she was the
only one who had a narrow escape from death.</font>

386
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:15,007
<font color="yellow">Kyung-sik, are you telling the truth?</font>

387
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:16,769
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

388
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:18,576
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

389
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:21,874
<font color="yellow">Back then, your wife...</font>

390
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:28,382
<font color="yellow">had been obviously pregnant.</font>

391
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:31,749
<font color="yellow">Preg...</font>

392
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:33,577
<font color="yellow">Preg...</font>

393
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,467
<font color="yellow">Pregnant?</font>

394
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,137
<font color="yellow">Kyung-sik!</font>

395
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:45,264
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

396
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,405
<font color="yellow">Elder.</font>

397
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:50,835
<font color="yellow">If my younger cousin
is speaking the truth,</font>

398
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:56,311
<font color="yellow">then your wife and
your child will both be alive.</font>

399
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:58,366
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

400
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:01,155
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

401
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

402
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,854
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

403
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:14,585
<font color="yellow">Soon-ok!</font>

404
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:18,142
<font color="yellow">- Deok-cheon!
- Elder! Elder! Elder!</font>

405
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:21,045
<font color="yellow">Elder! Elder!</font>

406
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:35,277
<font color="yellow">Elder, are you all right?</font>

407
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:40,598
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

408
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

409
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,590
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

410
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,942
<font color="yellow">This isn't the time
for me to be like this.</font>

411
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,691
<font color="yellow">He said my family had died.</font>

412
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,645
<font color="yellow">I need to find that broker Mr. Kim.</font>

413
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:03,998
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, my wife could be alive.</font>

414
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,994
<font color="yellow">I must find her.</font>

415
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:13,533
<font color="yellow">No matter what, I must find her.</font>

416
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:16,158
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

417
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,376
<font color="yellow">You must find her.</font>

418
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:20,949
<font color="yellow">You must find her no matter what.</font>

419
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:23,525
<font color="yellow">I'll find her for you, Elder.</font>

420
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,606
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, thank you.</font>

421
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,689
<font color="yellow">I told you that I was going
to adopt you as my son...</font>

422
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,841
<font color="yellow">I can't do this again...</font>

423
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,681
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that?</font>

424
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:46,182
<font color="yellow">If your family is alive,
you must find them first.</font>

425
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:48,502
<font color="yellow">Elder,</font>

426
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,945
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to find them for you.</font>

427
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:57,689
<font color="yellow">And if...</font>

428
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,755
<font color="yellow">if you can't find them...</font>

429
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:06,486
<font color="yellow">I'll become your son then.</font>

430
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:11,615
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

431
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:13,595
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

432
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:33,861
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

433
00:39:34,892 --> 00:39:38,869
<font color="yellow">We ate so many delicious foods
and went shopping, too.</font>

434
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:43,869
<font color="yellow">Now we're getting a foot massage, too.
I feel a lot better now.</font>

435
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:48,118
<font color="yellow">But mom, if Dal-ho ends up
on my father-in-law's family</font>

436
00:39:48,143 --> 00:39:51,738
<font color="yellow">registry, then will he have
to change his last name to Kim?</font>

437
00:39:52,408 --> 00:39:54,257
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask such
an obvious question?</font>

438
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:58,456
<font color="yellow">Then he's becoming a Kim?</font>

439
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,675
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- He'll be Kim Dal-ho instead of Jo Dal-ho?</font>

440
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,532
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! That's so strange!</font>

441
00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:06,939
<font color="yellow">Then our kids will become
Kim Hee-dong and Kim Hee-ra?</font>

442
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:11,121
<font color="yellow">That's so funny and strange!
My goodness!</font>

443
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,901
<font color="yellow">They'll still have to bear
with it even though it's strange.</font>

444
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:19,946
<font color="yellow">His last name Kim is the stamp
that will get them the inheritance.</font>

445
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:25,740
<font color="yellow">But still... Kim Dal-ho? Oh my goodness!</font>

446
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:27,235
<font color="yellow">It's so funny, mom!</font>

447
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,679
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo.</font>

448
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:35,888
<font color="yellow">Your story is great,
but you're lacking romance.</font>

449
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:40,961
<font color="yellow">Isn't it better to simply go with this rather
than ruin it with the wrong romance?</font>

450
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:44,880
<font color="yellow">That's what you think. There's no business
without romance these days.</font>

451
00:40:45,936 --> 00:40:47,003
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy.</font>

452
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,433
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, try dating.</font>

453
00:40:51,523 --> 00:40:52,988
<font color="yellow">Study women.</font>

454
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:54,835
<font color="yellow">I'm surrounded by women.</font>

455
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:57,105
<font color="yellow">Your grandma? Mom? Younger sister?</font>

456
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:00,943
<font color="yellow">Be with women you want
to sleep with, not women</font>

457
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:03,927
<font color="yellow">you eat with.
That's how business will do well.</font>

458
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:06,867
<font color="yellow">Come on, sir.</font>

459
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:08,906
<font color="yellow">Got it!</font>

460
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:14,466
<font color="yellow">Darn it. I have no luck nowadays.</font>

461
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:19,137
<font color="yellow">It's because I haven't
been practicing lately.</font>

462
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,531
<font color="yellow">I need to make more of an effort.
I forgot about that.</font>

463
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,764
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

464
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,484
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, I'm glad you're here!
Play Go-Stop with me!</font>

465
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:31,257
<font color="yellow">Sorry, grandma.</font>

466
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,804
<font color="yellow">I'll definitely give you a lesson
in Go-Stop next time.</font>

467
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,663
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I'll use your phone for a few days!</font>

468
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:41,180
<font color="yellow">- Hey! Bring that back here!
- Thanks!</font>

469
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:43,331
<font color="yellow">Did you lose yours again?</font>

470
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:44,851
<font color="yellow">That little punk!</font>

471
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:51,356
<font color="yellow">The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</font>

472
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:54,999
<font color="yellow">Damn it. Where the heck is my phone?</font>

473
00:41:58,507 --> 00:42:00,778
<font color="yellow">It has to be that woman.</font>

474
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:06,886
<font color="yellow">But she didn't seem like the
kind of woman to steal cell-phones.</font>

475
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:15,116
<font color="yellow">Damn it! Where the
heck did I lose it then?</font>

476
00:42:23,648 --> 00:42:28,522
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jo Hee-ra. If you cancel on us again
today, you're out of our group. So hurry up!</font>

477
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:29,765
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

478
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:32,776
<font color="yellow">What's up with him?
Why isn't he calling me?</font>

479
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:38,866
<font color="yellow">I mean, we spent the night together.</font>

480
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:41,894
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't he at least text me
to see if I got home okay?</font>

481
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:43,804
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

482
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:51,845
<font color="yellow">Where is my lipstick?</font>

483
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,936
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

484
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,765
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's over there.</font>

485
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,053
<font color="yellow">It's right here.</font>

486
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:09,289
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

487
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:12,578
<font color="yellow">Why is this here?</font>

488
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:22,655
<font color="yellow">Why do I have another cell-phone here?</font>

489
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:27,702
<font color="yellow">Is this his?</font>

490
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:30,912
<font color="yellow">But why is it in my bag?</font>

491
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:33,351
<font color="yellow">My bag.</font>

492
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,625
<font color="yellow">It's here!</font>

493
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,054
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

494
00:43:44,898 --> 00:43:47,021
<font color="yellow">What do I do? What do I do?</font>

495
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:58,140
<font color="yellow">To the person who has
my phone: please contact me.</font>

496
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:01,193
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

497
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:05,363
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

498
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:07,194
<font color="yellow">Now you're picking up?</font>

499
00:44:07,382 --> 00:44:09,704
<font color="yellow">Is it you?</font>

500
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:11,875
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

501
00:44:12,507 --> 00:44:13,974
<font color="yellow">You're right. It's me.</font>

502
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:17,608
<font color="yellow">Wow! Why would you take my phone? Why?</font>

503
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:19,614
<font color="yellow">Is it your hobby to make me mad?</font>

504
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,093
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

505
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:23,200
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that!</font>

506
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,352
<font color="yellow">I just found your phone in my bag!
I'm telling the truth!</font>

507
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,577
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Bring my phone
to me right now!</font>

508
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:59,913
<font color="yellow">I charged your battery all the way.</font>

509
00:45:01,523 --> 00:45:05,912
<font color="yellow">I'm telling this to you again,
but I really didn't take it on purpose.</font>

510
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:10,249
<font color="yellow">Then? Did you take it
because you were bored?</font>

511
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,273
<font color="yellow">I really didn't take it on purpose
or because I was bored.</font>

512
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:18,099
<font color="yellow">Look at this!</font>

513
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,632
<font color="yellow">This happened because
our cell-phones look alike!</font>

514
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:24,334
<font color="yellow">Think about it from
a woman's perspective.</font>

515
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,636
<font color="yellow">When I woke up, I was in
a strange motel with you.</font>

516
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:30,213
<font color="yellow">Do you know how surprised
and flustered I was?</font>

517
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:35,225
<font color="yellow">I had no idea that your phone
would be asleep in my bag!</font>

518
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,290
<font color="yellow">I guess that's possible.</font>

519
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,516
<font color="yellow">All right. All right.</font>

520
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:46,424
<font color="yellow">Anyways, it was
very uncomfortable for you</font>

521
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:49,132
<font color="yellow">because you didn't have
your cell-phone, right?</font>

522
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:51,625
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

523
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:56,679
<font color="yellow">Then I'll buy you beer
as a means of apology.</font>

524
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:58,291
<font color="yellow">You don't have to buy it.</font>

525
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:03,609
<font color="yellow">We still have our victory coupon,
so let's use this chance to drink together.</font>

526
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,376
<font color="yellow">You still have the victory coupon?</font>

527
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:08,265
<font color="yellow">Of course! It was hard
for us to win this.</font>

528
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:10,671
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

529
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:34,548
<font color="yellow">Good job today. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

530
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:39,562
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, you did
a good job today, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

543
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:43,094
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
Why are you yelling at him?</font>

do something like this when you</font>

<font color="yellow">But look for another house as soon
as possible and move out of here.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

561
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:23,040
<font color="yellow">But Yoo-sung, your grandma didn't
scold you because she hates you.</font>

562
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:27,319
<font color="yellow">Your grandma loves you so much.</font>

563
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:31,482
<font color="yellow">I know that. I'm not stupid.</font>

564
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:34,653
<font color="yellow">Of course not, my smarty-pants.</font>

565

566
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320

<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung, should I read you a story?</font>

570
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:55,929
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

571
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:57,507
<font color="yellow">This again?</font>

572
00:49:58,023 --> 00:49:59,339
<font color="yellow">Is this story that fun?</font>

573
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:03,419
<font color="yellow">Yes, the owl family
is very nice. I like them.</font>

574
00:50:03,718 --> 00:50:07,477
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll read you this story,
so close your eyes.</font>

575
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:13,608
<font color="yellow">"It's all right.
Since the deers can't move,</font>

576
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:15,929
<font color="yellow">we'll have to borrow strength
from the owls."</font>

577
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,023
<font color="yellow">"What? How can we help you?"</font>

578
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:22,957
<font color="yellow">"You guys have bright night vision
and strong wings,</font>

the presents for me.</font>

580
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:31,067
<font color="yellow">Please deliver these presents to the
children of the woods before morning comes."</font>

581
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,594
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's it!</font>

582
00:50:41,632 --> 00:50:42,816
<font color="yellow">What, aunt?</font>

583
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:47,799
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I have
a great idea for the logo contest!</font>

584
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:51,132
<font color="yellow">You're so lovable, Yoo-sung!</font>

585
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,616
<font color="yellow">What happened? Jo Hee-ra,
you're out of your mind!</font>

586
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,419
<font color="yellow">Why did this happen again?</font>

587
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,267
<font color="yellow">How could this happen
not once but twice?</font>

588
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,633
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous!</font>

589
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:57,632
<font color="yellow">I'm saved.</font>

590
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:59,307
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

591
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:06,226
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra.</font>

592
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:09,329
<font color="yellow">What's up with you?</font>

593
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:12,702
<font color="yellow">Where were you last night?
Why are you coming home now?</font>

594
00:52:13,452 --> 00:52:17,005
<font color="yellow">What happened was...</font>

595
00:52:19,523 --> 00:52:20,796
<font color="yellow">At my friend's house...</font>

596
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:24,551
<font color="yellow">Mom! Father!</font>

597
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:28,208
<font color="yellow">Okay! Okay! I'll tell you everything!</font>

598
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,500
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, please! I'm begging you!</font>

599
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:34,327
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, I'm sorry,
so please don't do this!</font>

600
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:42,913
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

601
00:52:44,156 --> 00:52:49,156
<font color="yellow">you went to the motel with the
same guy twice after getting drunk...</font>

602
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:50,789
<font color="yellow">but nothing happened?</font>

603
00:52:51,954 --> 00:52:53,613
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes sense?</font>

604
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,205
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

605
00:52:56,955 --> 00:52:58,464
<font color="yellow">to be exact...</font>

606
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:03,276
<font color="yellow">I didn't go to a motel.
When I woke up, I was in a motel.</font>

607
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:06,705
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

608
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:09,795
<font color="yellow">My fist is crying...</font>

609
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:11,197
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jo Hee-ra.</font>

610
00:53:11,986 --> 00:53:12,986
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

611
00:53:13,346 --> 00:53:16,517
<font color="yellow">How can you drink so much when you don't
even know what kind of guy he is?</font>

612
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:18,001
<font color="yellow">What if he was a strange guy?</font>

613
00:53:18,026 --> 00:53:19,253
<font color="yellow">He's not.</font>

614
00:53:20,205 --> 00:53:23,189
<font color="yellow">I drank with him twice
and shared a lot of conversations</font>

615
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:25,592
<font color="yellow">with him. Wouldn't I
at least know that much?</font>

616
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,027
<font color="yellow">I really don't know what to say.</font>

617
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:35,183
<font color="yellow">How can you go to the motel with
the same guy you don't know twice?</font>

618
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:38,712
<font color="yellow">I didn't go to a motel!
When I woke up I was in a motel!</font>

619
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:40,947
<font color="yellow">That's the same damn thing!
Are you kidding me?</font>

620
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:49,334
<font color="yellow">But I'm asking you this
because I'm really, really curious.</font>

621
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,677
<font color="yellow">Am I really not charming as a woman?</font>

622
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,647
<font color="yellow">Why are you mentioning that right now?</font>

623
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,607
<font color="yellow">That guy is strange!</font>

624
00:53:58,197 --> 00:54:01,046
<font color="yellow">Just like you said, does it make
sense that nothing happened?</font>

625
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:05,983
<font color="yellow">We went to the motel twice,
so how could he treat me as if I'm a rock?</font>

626
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:09,861
<font color="yellow">I mean, how can he just leave me alone?</font>

627
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:11,856
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- You're crazy.</font>

628
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:14,673
<font color="yellow">You haven't come to your senses yet.</font>

629
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:22,984
<font color="yellow">Since you didn't lie and told me the
truth today, I'll hold it in and let it slide.</font>

630
00:54:23,268 --> 00:54:26,892
<font color="yellow">But watch what happens
if you get caught staying out again.</font>

631
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:31,442
<font color="yellow">As your brother, I will break your legs.</font>

632
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,603
<font color="yellow">I'm warning you.</font>

633
00:54:44,346 --> 00:54:45,346
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

634
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:52,232
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Is that guy still unable
to forget his ex-girlfriend?</font>

635
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:55,822
<font color="yellow">Or maybe...</font>

636
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:57,933
<font color="yellow">That boy is a eunuch.</font>

637
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,111
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

638
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,620
<font color="yellow">He's a eunuch.</font>

639
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,457
<font color="yellow">Grandma, how can you say that
about someone else's precious grandson?</font>

640
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,883
<font color="yellow">I'm not making up anything.</font>

641
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:09,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

642
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,105
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

643
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,392
<font color="yellow">A man and a woman spent the night in
one room together, not once but twice.</font>

644
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:18,257
<font color="yellow">But nothing happened.</font>

645
00:55:18,921 --> 00:55:22,252
<font color="yellow">Come on. Do you think that makes sense?</font>

646
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:24,596
<font color="yellow">It doesn't.</font>

647
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,892
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Why did he do that?</font>

648
00:55:26,432 --> 00:55:29,267
<font color="yellow">I don't know who
this friend of yours is,</font>

649
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:35,093
<font color="yellow">but he definitely doesn't
know how to be a man.</font>

650
00:55:35,118 --> 00:55:37,455
<font color="yellow">In other words, he's a eunuch!</font>

651
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,860
<font color="yellow">He's not a eunuch, grandma!</font>

652
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,359
<font color="yellow">I swear he's the manliest of men!</font>

653
00:55:44,807 --> 00:55:45,807
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

654
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:47,275
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

655
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:52,885
<font color="yellow">Then that boy was
trying to protect that girl.</font>

656
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,627
<font color="yellow">In other words, he...</font>

657
00:55:57,588 --> 00:55:58,588
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

658
00:55:58,603 --> 00:56:01,492
<font color="yellow">Your friend must really like her.</font>

659
00:56:02,814 --> 00:56:04,113
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

660
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:10,183
<font color="yellow">You're right, but I don't even
think such men exist anymore.</font>

661
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:14,269
<font color="yellow">Except for you, Jang-soo. Right?</font>

662
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:16,842
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- Sure...</font>

663
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:22,744
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

664
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:04,947
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

665
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:08,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Are you done with your work?</font>

666
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,349
<font color="yellow">If you're not busy today,
buy me black bean noodles.</font>

667
00:57:13,174 --> 00:57:14,441
<font color="yellow">Black bean noodles?</font>

668
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:17,256
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep asking me
for black bean noodles?</font>

669
00:57:17,572 --> 00:57:19,322
<font color="yellow">You can't afford it?</font>

670
00:57:20,682 --> 00:57:21,984
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

671
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:27,072
<font color="yellow">I don't know why, but black bean
noodles taste best when you buy it.</font>

672
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,442
<font color="yellow">If I buy it alone,
it doesn't taste that good.</font>

673
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:33,785
<font color="yellow">Don't lie. All black bean noodles
taste the same. There's no such thing.</font>

674
00:57:34,432 --> 00:57:36,220
<font color="yellow">What? So you won't buy it for me?</font>

675
00:57:36,877 --> 00:57:39,827
<font color="yellow">When I fixed your motorcycle, what did
you say to me? Did you or did you</font>

676
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:42,501
<font color="yellow">not say you would buy black bean
noodles? Did you already forget?</font>

677
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:45,274
<font color="yellow">I remember. I said I would buy it.</font>

678
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:47,430
<font color="yellow">But I'll buy it next time.</font>

679
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:49,935
<font color="yellow">I'm very busy today.</font>

680
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:51,611
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

681
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:54,056
<font color="yellow">You're not lying because you
don't want to buy it?</font>

682
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:58,680
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying! I'm busy because
I'm preparing for the logo contest.</font>

683
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,580
<font color="yellow">Logo contest?</font>

684
00:58:03,197 --> 00:58:04,197
<font color="yellow">Do it here?</font>

685
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:05,455
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

686
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,955
<font color="yellow">You'll need internet in order to
research ideas and sketch them out.</font>

687
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:13,011
<font color="yellow">That's true, but...</font>

688
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:16,978
<font color="yellow">My aunt left work early,
and I need to go out to meet a client.</font>

689
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:19,873
<font color="yellow">So go ahead and focus here.</font>

690
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,716
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Jang-go.</font>

691
00:58:24,346 --> 00:58:26,033
<font color="yellow">Double the size of black bean noodles.</font>

692
00:58:26,424 --> 00:58:27,424
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

693
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:31,464
<font color="yellow">But you're going to make
an owl the logo of a fashion</font>

694
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:33,413
<font color="yellow">company. How did you
come up with such an idea?</font>

695
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:37,166
<font color="yellow">While reading a story for Yoo-sung.</font>

696
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:39,647
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

697
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:41,692
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's a good idea?</font>

698
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:43,275
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

699
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:47,184
<font color="yellow">I think the idea is good.</font>

700
00:58:48,314 --> 00:58:52,098
<font color="yellow">In the west, owls symbolize Athena,
the goddess of wisdom.</font>

701
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,445
<font color="yellow">In the east, they symbolize
wealth and fame.</font>

702
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:58,452
<font color="yellow">First, I think it would be
best for you to create a</font>

703
00:58:58,477 --> 00:59:01,686
<font color="yellow">simple and approachable design
that anyone could like.</font>

704
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:08,707
<font color="yellow">Hearing you talk, owls go back
and forth in my mind. I'll try my best!</font>

705
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:12,476
<font color="yellow">What if you really win the
contest because of me?</font>

706
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:15,236
<font color="yellow">Then double the size of
black bean noodles isn't enough.</font>

707
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:17,330
<font color="yellow">- You need to buy sweet and sour pork, too.
- Okay.</font>

708
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:23,123
<font color="yellow">If I win, I'll make sure you can never say
the words "black bean noodles" ever again.</font>

709
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:26,734
<font color="yellow">You know how to use the
computer and printer, right?</font>

710
00:59:29,408 --> 00:59:32,830
<font color="yellow">I'll come back here after my meeting,
so let's eat dinner together. Do your best!</font>

711
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,041
<font color="yellow">Good luck!</font>

712
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:34,062
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

713
01:00:36,478 --> 01:00:38,025
<font color="yellow">To get a date.</font>

714
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:39,549
<font color="yellow">A date?</font>

715
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:41,268
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

716
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:44,469
<font color="yellow">You're going to
get Dal-ho's adoption date?</font>

717
01:00:45,728 --> 01:00:48,736
<font color="yellow">You're so tactful!</font>

718
01:00:50,408 --> 01:00:54,090
<font color="yellow">It's an important date when
a parent and a child meets.</font>

719
01:00:54,674 --> 01:00:56,378
<font color="yellow">We need to get a good date for that.</font>

720
01:00:56,705 --> 01:00:58,346
<font color="yellow">You're right!</font>

721
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,800
<font color="yellow">Let me come with you!</font>

722
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:02,185
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

723
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:15,482
<font color="yellow">His last name won't change.</font>

724
01:01:17,736 --> 01:01:18,803
<font color="yellow">It won't change?</font>

725
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:21,242
<font color="yellow">It's going to be changed soon.</font>

726
01:01:22,518 --> 01:01:25,417
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that and
just tell us the good date.</font>

727
01:01:25,924 --> 01:01:27,452
<font color="yellow">How can I when it won't change?</font>

728
01:01:28,221 --> 01:01:29,932
<font color="yellow">It needs to change for me to get a date.</font>

729
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:31,526
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

730
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:34,477
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep talking
about something else?</font>

731
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:38,382
<font color="yellow">He's going to change
his last name from Jo to Kim.</font>

732
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:43,283
<font color="yellow">So just tell us the good date
to change his last name.</font>

733
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:46,672
<font color="yellow">How can it change when
something is stuck on you?</font>

734
01:01:46,939 --> 01:01:49,067
<font color="yellow">You can't change
family relationships so easily!</font>

735
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,903
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there a problem?</font>

736
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:53,915
<font color="yellow">What's stuck on us? A ghost?</font>

737
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,213
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Let's go.</font>

738
01:01:56,238 --> 01:01:58,242
<font color="yellow">No. What is it?</font>

739
01:01:58,267 --> 01:02:00,196
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! Come out!
- Why?</font>

740
01:02:00,439 --> 01:02:01,439
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

741
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,312
<font color="yellow">You'll be wasting a lot of your time!</font>

742
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:22,791
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

743
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:27,103
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

744
01:02:27,932 --> 01:02:29,199
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

745
