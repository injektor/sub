00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,764
<font color="yellow">How can you not know how to dance that?</font>

3
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:13,991
<font color="yellow">I wonder why you can't do this.</font>

4
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:15,970
<font color="yellow">Watch me carefully.</font>

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,492
<font color="yellow">Like this. Like this. Like this.</font>

6
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:47,656
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong.</font>

7
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,578
<font color="yellow">What did you just do to me right now?</font>

8
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,649
<font color="yellow">What do you mean what did I do?</font>

9
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:56,213
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

10
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,779
<font color="yellow">Didn't you grab and
pull my arm and waist first?</font>

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,117
<font color="yellow">Well, I did that because I thought you
might fall down the stairs.</font>

12
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:06,845
<font color="yellow">I tried to save you.</font>

13
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:08,742
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

14
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:11,137
<font color="yellow">I was trying not get hurt either.</font>

15
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:16,606
<font color="yellow">If you didn't want to get hurt,
you should have just</font>

16
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:19,978
<font color="yellow">grabbed my hand.
Why did you have to hug my neck?</font>

17
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:26,483
<font color="yellow">Was this a kiss by willful negligence?</font>

18
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:27,797
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

19
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:30,462
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

20
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:31,640
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

21
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:32,890
<font color="yellow">Willful negligence.</font>

22
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:37,577
<font color="yellow">You didn't intentionally
plan on kissing me,</font>

23
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,273
<font color="yellow">but even with such
a highly probability that</font>

24
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,170
<font color="yellow">it would happen,
you still danced anyways.</font>

25
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:46,102
<font color="yellow">I'm right.</font>

26
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:47,507
<font color="yellow">You did do that.</font>

27
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,789
<font color="yellow">Yup.</font>

28
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:57,090
<font color="yellow">So are you saying that I kissed you on
purpose but covered it up as an accident?</font>

29
00:01:57,578 --> 00:02:00,930
<font color="yellow">That's the only way I can
think of it in this situation.</font>

30
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,615
<font color="yellow">No! That's not true!</font>

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,663
<font color="yellow">That was just an accident!</font>

32
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:10,320
<font color="yellow">I'm crushed that
you stole my lips like this.</font>

33
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:12,883
<font color="yellow">I'm devastated.</font>

34
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,111
<font color="yellow">Do you really think
that's what happened?</font>

35
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,842
<font color="yellow">Acknowledge that this was an accident!</font>

36
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:31,023
<font color="yellow">Our lips just bumped into
each other! It wasn't a kiss!</font>

37
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,429
<font color="yellow">If you don't acknowledge that this
was an accident, you can never leave!</font>

38
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:39,674
<font color="yellow">All I did was grab onto you
because I didn't want to fall!</font>

39
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:41,273
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

40
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,794
<font color="yellow">It's not like you can return
my stolen kiss to me.</font>

41
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:47,875
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that happened.</font>

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,456
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking like that?</font>

43
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:54,427
<font color="yellow">Don't just say that!
Acknowledge that this was an accident!</font>

44
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:58,591
<font color="yellow">I swear to God that
I wasn't doing willful negligence!</font>

45
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:02,456
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, you were
a player in North Korea, weren't you?</font>

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,216
<font color="yellow">Pyeongyang Player.</font>

47
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,798
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem like
you just did this a couple times.</font>

48
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:10,208
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to a woman?</font>

49
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:15,550
<font color="yellow">Now I see that you're not someone
I should be associated with!</font>

50
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:20,410
<font color="yellow">If I associate with you from now on,
I'm not a person but a duck! A duck!</font>

51
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,997
<font color="yellow">Hey! Mi-poong! Mi-poong!</font>

52
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:25,703
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was a joke.</font>

53
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:27,352
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

54
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:29,163
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you know me anymore.</font>

55
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,006
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Don't be mad.</font>

56
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,865
<font color="yellow">I won't do that again.</font>

57
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,408
<font color="yellow">What? Are you crying?</font>

58
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,794
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, it was just a joke!</font>

59
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:49,640
<font color="yellow">Should we go eat ice cream?</font>

60
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:53,726
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a baby?</font>

61
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:55,726
<font color="yellow">You pumpkin head!</font>

62
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,922
<font color="yellow">Fine! Okay, okay!</font>

63
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,765
<font color="yellow">I'm a pumpkin head. I'm a pumpkin head.</font>

64
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,569
<font color="yellow">So don't be mad anymore.</font>

65
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,477
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

66
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,311
<font color="yellow">Fine! You can hit me once!</font>

67
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,427
<font color="yellow">She really hit me?</font>

68
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:21,217
<font color="yellow">You're not mad anymore, right?</font>

69
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:23,617
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

70
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:35,720
<font color="yellow">That's enough. Stop.</font>

71
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,325
<font color="yellow">You want me to stop?</font>

72
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,732
<font color="yellow">There are still many more left.</font>

73
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,351
<font color="yellow">Someone else is coming,
so stop washing the</font>

74
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:45,151
<font color="yellow">grills, and start serving
in the hall tomorrow.</font>

75
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:53,281
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

76
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:06,404
<font color="yellow">But isn't the daily wage fifty dollars?</font>

77
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:12,270
<font color="yellow">How can you expect getting all
fifty dollars when you worked like that?</font>

78
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,882
<font color="yellow">You didn't even do half
of the work the others did.</font>

79
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:19,528
<font color="yellow">My restaurant doesn't pay you by the hour
but by the number of grills you washed.</font>

80
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:24,064
<font color="yellow">You'll be serving the hall tomorrow,
so make sure you put on some make-up.</font>

81
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:34,773
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better now?</font>

82
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:37,663
<font color="yellow">Do you love teasing me that much?</font>

83
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:39,984
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

84
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:43,585
<font color="yellow">If I play a joke and there's
no reaction, it's no fun.</font>

85
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:46,439
<font color="yellow">But you react right away, so it's fun.</font>

86
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:50,411
<font color="yellow">If you do that again,
you'll be bleeding from both nostrils.</font>

87
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,507
<font color="yellow">Bleeding from both nostrils?</font>

88
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:01,929
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

89
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:12,349
<font color="yellow">Isn't it really fascinating?</font>

90
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,461
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

91
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:19,703
<font color="yellow">You and I separated like that in Macau.</font>

92
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:24,937
<font color="yellow">I was in North Korea, and you were
living here in South Korea.</font>

93
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:28,238
<font color="yellow">Yet, we looked around
Seoul together today.</font>

94
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:32,117
<font color="yellow">The more I think about it,
the more fascinated I am.</font>

95
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:33,511
<font color="yellow">I feel like that, too.</font>

96
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,632
<font color="yellow">You should be in North Korea, but here
we are eating ice cream together.</font>

97
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,397
<font color="yellow">It's strange but fascinating.</font>

98
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,242
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong...</font>

99
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,930
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

100
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:55,477
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

101
00:06:56,757 --> 00:07:02,053
<font color="yellow">You're curious about why
we ran away from North Korea, too.</font>

102
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:05,914
<font color="yellow">That's what you want
to ask me about, don't you?</font>

103
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:10,398
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

104
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:16,119
<font color="yellow">When I say I'm from North Korea,</font>

105
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,309
<font color="yellow">the first thing most people ask me
is why I ran away from there.</font>

106
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,580
<font color="yellow">That must be what they're
most curious about.</font>

107
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:31,332
<font color="yellow">They're suspicious that I must
have done something terrible.</font>

108
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:37,586
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, it's okay.
You don't have to tell me.</font>

109
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,546
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you that story later.</font>

110
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:50,296
<font color="yellow">I don't want to spoil this great day
with such a somber story.</font>

111
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:54,086
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,</font>

112
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:58,265
<font color="yellow">for the first time, I felt like
I really belonged in Seoul</font>

113
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,406
<font color="yellow">and became a citizen
of the Republic of Korea.</font>

114
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,890
<font color="yellow">In heaven, my brother
will be very grateful to you.</font>

115
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:33,849
<font color="yellow">Very good.</font>

116
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:34,874
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

117
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:40,599
<font color="yellow">it seems like your love wound...</font>

118
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,299
<font color="yellow">is very deep, too.</font>

119
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,958
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's very deep.</font>

120
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:51,805
<font color="yellow">If I scrape my knee,
I can put medicine on it.</font>

121
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,216
<font color="yellow">But when your heart hurts,</font>

122
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,264
<font color="yellow">there's no medicine for that.</font>

123
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,184
<font color="yellow">Love doesn't last forever.</font>

124
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,641
<font color="yellow">You shouldn’t put your life
on the line for love, too.</font>

125
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:07,487
<font color="yellow">Of course I won't!</font>

126
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:13,939
<font color="yellow">You can love again,
but you only have one life.</font>

127
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:19,250
<font color="yellow">You and I understand
each other pretty well.</font>

128
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:23,693
<font color="yellow">To celebrate that, let's drink
one more bottle of beer. Deal?</font>

129
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:24,718
<font color="yellow">Deal!</font>

130
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:26,873
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

131
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:28,717
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

132
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:33,494
<font color="yellow">We're starting a couple event where you
have to compete to drink beer the fastest.</font>

133
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:36,193
<font color="yellow">If you're interested,
you can participate in it.</font>

134
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:38,661
<font color="yellow">What are the prizes?</font>

135
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,209
<font color="yellow">First place gets twenty
free bottles of beers,</font>

136
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:43,530
<font color="yellow">second place gets ten,
and third place gets five.</font>

137
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:44,834
<font color="yellow">- Deal?
- Deal.</font>

138
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:46,859
<font color="yellow">Where do we have to go?</font>

139
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:50,661
<font color="yellow">Who will win first place for the
fastest beer drinking contest?</font>

140
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,686
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

141
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:53,794
<font color="yellow">Ready, set, go!</font>

142
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,178
<font color="yellow">First and second couples are the fastest
so far! Which one of them will win?</font>

143
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:16,224
<font color="yellow">The second couple is pretty fast!</font>

144
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,484
<font color="yellow">Can the second couple win first place?</font>

145
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:20,909
<font color="yellow">She got up!</font>

146
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,529
<font color="yellow">She's drinking it! One shot!</font>

147
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:25,243
<font color="yellow">They won!</font>

148
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,207
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong, you were a player
in North Korea, weren't you?</font>

149
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,925
<font color="yellow">Pyeongyang Player.</font>

150
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,280
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to a woman?</font>

151
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,420
<font color="yellow">Now I see that you're not someone
I should be associated with!</font>

152
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:03,583
<font color="yellow">If I associate with you from now on,
I'm not a person but a duck! A duck!</font>

153
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,974
<font color="yellow">What happened to Jang-soo?</font>

154
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:19,787
<font color="yellow">One, two. One, two. One, two.</font>

155
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,037
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Yes?</font>

156
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,184
<font color="yellow">Where did Hee-ra go?</font>

157
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,626
<font color="yellow">Why? Isn't she in her room?</font>

158
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:30,381
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

159
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:33,610
<font color="yellow">Did that brat not come home
last night, mom?</font>

160
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,388
<font color="yellow">Oh, I forgot!</font>

161
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:39,483
<font color="yellow">Yesterday she said she was going
to sleep over at Hye-rin's house.</font>

162
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:41,553
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

163
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:43,485
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

164
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:52,155
<font color="yellow">Mom, tell Hee-ra not to
stay out overnight again.</font>

165
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:53,811
<font color="yellow">It will become a habit.</font>

166
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

167
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,029
<font color="yellow">This little brat.</font>

168
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,068
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

169
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:14,772
<font color="yellow">She really must not have come home!</font>

170
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,225
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

171
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,347
<font color="yellow">She went out dressed so well yesterday!</font>

172
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:25,143
<font color="yellow">I should cut off
all her hair or something!</font>

173
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:27,306
<font color="yellow">What can I do about this brat?</font>

174
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,014
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

175
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:45,693
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

176
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:48,678
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

177
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,021
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

178
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,495
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Tell me!</font>

179
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:58,748
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

180
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:02,543
<font color="yellow">I'm coming. I'm coming right now.</font>

181
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:05,689
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

182
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:08,351
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

183
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:21,678
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

184
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:23,787
<font color="yellow">Just get on my back.</font>

185
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:28,745
<font color="yellow">Where do you live?</font>

186
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:31,945
<font color="yellow">- No! No!
- Darn it!</font>

187
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,131
<font color="yellow">Why are you pushing me?</font>

188
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,465
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and come out.</font>

189
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:44,053
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Mister, where are we?</font>

190
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,078
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

191
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,859
<font color="yellow">"Shy, shy, shy."</font>

192
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:52,922
<font color="yellow">She's freaking heavy.</font>

193
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,436
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

194
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,217
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. How can
a woman snore like that?</font>

195
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,778
<font color="yellow">Nothing else happened, right?</font>

196
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,014
<font color="yellow">There was nothing more, right?</font>

197
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:13,395
<font color="yellow">Why can't I remember anything else?</font>

198
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,900
<font color="yellow">Where did my bag go? My bag.</font>

199
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,526
<font color="yellow">It's right here.</font>

200
00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:40,097
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

201
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:43,601
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare scream! You know
what will happen if Hee-dong finds out!</font>

202
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:45,888
<font color="yellow">I dare you to scream, you little brat!</font>

203
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:49,740
<font color="yellow">So what if he finds out?
I'll just be beaten to death!</font>

204
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:53,412
<font color="yellow">Did you do something
you should be beaten to death for?</font>

205
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,941
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

206
00:14:55,965 --> 00:15:01,131
<font color="yellow">What do you mean what did I do?
Why do you keep yelling at me like that?</font>

207
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:05,458
<font color="yellow">All I did was drink because I was upset,
and when I woke up, I was in a motel!</font>

208
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,547
<font color="yellow">You slept in a motel?</font>

209
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,083
<font color="yellow">With who? With who?</font>

210
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:11,655
<font color="yellow">Tell me!</font>

211
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,181
<font color="yellow">I don't know! I said I don't know!</font>

212
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:15,967
<font color="yellow">You don't know?</font>

213
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:19,965
<font color="yellow">You slept with a guy you don't know?</font>

214
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,088
<font color="yellow">I did sleep with him,
but nothing happened!</font>

215
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:25,113
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

216
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,565
<font color="yellow">How can you do that to me
after I raised you?</font>

217
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,059
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting me?</font>

218
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,084
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

219
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:43,287
<font color="yellow">Starting from today, you're not my daughter,
so pack your bags and leave!</font>

220
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,200
<font color="yellow">Why would I leave? Why?</font>

221
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,789
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

222
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,695
<font color="yellow">I told you that nothing happened!</font>

223
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,667
<font color="yellow">You're ridiculous.</font>

224
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:56,768
<font color="yellow">Enough talking.</font>

225
00:15:57,534 --> 00:16:00,814
<font color="yellow">I don't need a daughter
like you, so get out.</font>

226
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,070
<font color="yellow">I won't leave. Whose fault is this?</font>

227
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,020
<font color="yellow">It's all your fault!</font>

228
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:09,495
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

229
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:14,162
<font color="yellow">Honestly, do you know how upset
I was because of your friend's son?</font>

230
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:16,834
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't gone on
that blind date with your</font>

231
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,031
<font color="yellow">friend's son, I wouldn't have
gotten upset and drank!</font>

232
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,300
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing him up right now?</font>

233
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:24,430
<font color="yellow">It was all over!</font>

234
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,214
<font color="yellow">No, it wasn't!</font>

235
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:33,383
<font color="yellow">I was going to end it back then, too,
but Ms. Hwang told me to date her son.</font>

236
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:37,576
<font color="yellow">She told me that her son is a simpleton
so that I should go see him first!</font>

237
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,533
<font color="yellow">That's why I did that! But...</font>

238
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:45,684
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

239
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:54,199
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything from the beginning
to the end without leaving anything out!</font>

240
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:57,878
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything!</font>

241
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,892
<font color="yellow">That's why I really
was going to end things,</font>

242
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,135
<font color="yellow">but Ms. Hwang called me again and
said there was another misunderstanding.</font>

243
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,518
<font color="yellow">That's why I thought he
was being serious this time,</font>

244
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,132
<font color="yellow">but when I met him,
he said that wasn't true again!</font>

245
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,287
<font color="yellow">That's what happened!</font>

246
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:34,562
<font color="yellow">They were playing around with me!
Shouldn't your friend not do that for your sake?</font>

247
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,159
<font color="yellow">How dare they toy
around with my daughter.</font>

248
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:41,378
<font color="yellow">How dare they looked down
about me and my family!</font>

249
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,821
<font color="yellow">I won't let this slide!</font>

250
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:06,085
<font color="yellow">She's still lying down?</font>

251
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:09,740
<font color="yellow">Just pretend you don't know anything.</font>

252
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:14,294
<font color="yellow">I feel bitter like someone stole my money.
How would Geum-sil feel then?</font>

253
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:17,291
<font color="yellow">You can't force your kids to
be in a relationship you want.</font>

254
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:21,511
<font color="yellow">If you could, there would be
no problems in this world.</font>

255
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:22,994
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

256
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,565
<font color="yellow">Then what was that phoenix dream about?</font>

257
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,432
<font color="yellow">Was it just a silly dream?</font>

258
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,100
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean
by a phoenix dream?</font>

259
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:34,191
<font color="yellow">The day before Jang-go went
on his blind date, I had a dream</font>

260
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:36,713
<font color="yellow">that a golden phoenix came
right through that front gate.</font>

261
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,609
<font color="yellow">It was so vivid.</font>

262
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,410
<font color="yellow">That's why I thought it was
his dream and sold it to</font>

263
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:43,679
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil for a hundred dollars.
I feel so bad now.</font>

264
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:48,088
<font color="yellow">How can you get a hundred dollars
for a silly dream?</font>

265
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:49,973
<font color="yellow">Give her fifty dollars back!</font>

266
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:54,144
<font color="yellow">No way! Jang-go is the one
who kicked that phoenix out of his life!</font>

267
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:56,906
<font color="yellow">I really don't understand him.</font>

268
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:00,517
<font color="yellow">How could he reject the position
as the son-in-law of a wealthy household?</font>

269
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,742
<font color="yellow">It's such a waste.</font>

270
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,346
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil has every reason
to be depressed.</font>

271
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:07,917
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

272
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,581
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hwang Geum-sil, open the door!</font>

273
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,774
<font color="yellow">Who the heck is that?</font>

274
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:18,994
<font color="yellow">- Who the heck is calling Geum-sil so rudely?
- Hwang Geum-sil, open the door!</font>

275
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,284
<font color="yellow">Open the door!</font>

276
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,956
<font color="yellow">- This is a female gangster!
- Mom, mom, mom!</font>

277
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:26,344
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- I think it's Geum-sil's 100 million dollar friend.</font>

278
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:30,487
<font color="yellow">- Open the door!
- What? But why is such a wealthy
woman acting so unrefined?</font>

279
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:32,761
<font color="yellow">- I'll break this open!
- So what if she has money?</font>

280
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,229
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you going to do?</font>

281
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,246
<font color="yellow">Just stay. I'll go out.</font>

282
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,685
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here
yelling in front of my house?</font>

283
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:47,260
<font color="yellow">What am I doing here?</font>

284
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:49,677
<font color="yellow">You don't know why I'm here?</font>

285
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,960
<font color="yellow">How can you do this?
Are you even my friend?</font>

286
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,561
<font color="yellow">You need to tell me the whole story.
If you just talk to</font>

287
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:59,620
<font color="yellow">me like that, how can
I understand what you're saying?</font>

288
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,759
<font color="yellow">I told you that we weren't
meant to be in-laws,</font>

289
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:05,802
<font color="yellow">so you should have
just ended it at that.</font>

290
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:09,276
<font color="yellow">You secretly met my innocent Hee-ra.</font>

291
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,127
<font color="yellow">And you said what? That how the
man acts depends on the woman?</font>

292
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:17,043
<font color="yellow">Did you or did you not tell
my daughter to seduce your son?</font>

293
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:20,184
<font color="yellow">How can you do that to my daughter?</font>

294
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,677
<font color="yellow">I thought you were talking
about something else.</font>

295
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,581
<font color="yellow">Is that why you're throwing
a fit right now?</font>

296
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,302
<font color="yellow">What? "I thought you were
talking about something else?"</font>

297
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:30,015
<font color="yellow">Are you freaking serious?</font>

298
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:34,563
<font color="yellow">Your daughter seemed
to like my son a lot, so</font>

299
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,119
<font color="yellow">I told her to ask him out
one more time. Is that so wrong?</font>

300
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,961
<font color="yellow">Do you think your son
is suitable for my daughter?</font>

301
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:43,529
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

302
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,890
<font color="yellow">You were so desperate to let
my daughter and your son meet.</font>

303
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,180
<font color="yellow">That's why I allowed them
to eat a meal together.</font>

304
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:57,330
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You should know
you're barking up the wrong tree.</font>

305
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,583
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

306
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:04,045
<font color="yellow">I'm getting cursed out for
simply letting our kids meet up.</font>

307
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,231
<font color="yellow">Hey. We need to make things clear here.</font>

308
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,732
<font color="yellow">Your daughter liked my son,
but he didn't like</font>

309
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:16,021
<font color="yellow">her, so they ended.
Let's just leave it at that.</font>

310
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:19,433
<font color="yellow">He has nothing,
but he doesn't like my daughter?</font>

311
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,279
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even have
the right to not like her!</font>

312
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:24,646
<font color="yellow">Ma Chung-ja!</font>

313
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,833
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

314
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,937
<font color="yellow">What? "He has nothing?"</font>

315
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:34,591
<font color="yellow">Then why did you borrow money
from me when I have nothing?</font>

316
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

317
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,563
<font color="yellow">Now I know!</font>

318
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,152
<font color="yellow">I thought I was wrong, but you were
so nice to me about lending me</font>

319
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,600
<font color="yellow">money because you wanted my daughter
as your daughter-in-law. Right?</font>

320
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,841
<font color="yellow">I thought you did that
because we were friends.</font>

321
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:56,311
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you ever again!</font>

322
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:57,718
<font color="yellow">We're through!</font>

323
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,513
<font color="yellow">Fine! We're through!</font>

324
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:02,169
<font color="yellow">But you should pay back the
money you borrowed from me.</font>

325
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,964
<font color="yellow">We're not friends anymore,
so you should pay back the</font>

326
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:10,430
<font color="yellow">$45,000 you borrowed from me
by the end of this week.</font>

327
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:14,942
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

328
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,233
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back.</font>

329
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,962
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back that
measly $45,000 so, Hwang</font>

330
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:24,567
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, let's not ever
see each other again.</font>

331
00:22:30,505 --> 00:22:31,505
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

332
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,200
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

333
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,104
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You told us
that you didn't have a penny</font>

334
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:40,813
<font color="yellow">and always complained
about not having any money.</font>

335
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:43,849
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

336
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:48,052
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

337
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:50,219
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

338
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:09,848
<font color="yellow">But how can I make $45,000
by the end of this week?</font>

339
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:12,585
<font color="yellow">I can't make another private loan again.</font>

340
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:15,801
<font color="yellow">Private loans are scary.</font>

341
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,363
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me, Chung-ja.</font>

342
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:28,978
<font color="yellow">Young-soon, can I borrow some money?</font>

343
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,612
<font color="yellow">Goodness, I don't have any money.</font>

344
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:35,304
<font color="yellow">You know that my husband
is in control of it.</font>

345
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,657
<font color="yellow">- I heard you fought with Geum-sil.
Did you need to pay her back?
- Goodness.</font>

346
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:40,427
<font color="yellow">Forget it!</font>

347
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,487
<font color="yellow">You don't have to lend it to me,
so stop asking me questions!</font>

348
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:46,570
<font color="yellow">They're not my friends!</font>

349
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:52,786
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

350
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:54,830
<font color="yellow">That's the only way.</font>

351
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:01,437
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

352
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,172
<font color="yellow">Is my father here?</font>

353
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:05,731
<font color="yellow">Is he in the office?</font>

354
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:08,051
<font color="yellow">He's over there with some guests.</font>

355
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,234
<font color="yellow">Really? Eat a lot.</font>

356
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:19,069
<font color="yellow">Who are those people?</font>

357
00:24:20,812 --> 00:24:23,902
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to father
about money issues.</font>

358
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:25,944
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

359
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:28,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was just passing by.</font>

360
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:31,743
<font color="yellow">But who are those people?</font>

361
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,526
<font color="yellow">They seem like workers.</font>

362
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,486
<font color="yellow">Elder is going to give his
Yangpyeong orchard to charity,</font>

363
00:24:38,683 --> 00:24:40,739
<font color="yellow">so he's discussing the taxes
and process for that.</font>

364
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:43,917
<font color="yellow">He's going to give the
Yangpyeong orchard to charity?</font>

365
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:46,355
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

366
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:47,741
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

367
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,110
<font color="yellow">What do you mean why?</font>

368
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,231
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

369
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:58,019
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

370
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,957
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything
when he said he was going</font>

371
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,973
<font color="yellow">to give the Yangpyeong
orchard to charity?</font>

372
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,926
<font color="yellow">And why didn't you tell me
such an important thing?</font>

373
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:10,458
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to tell you that Elder
is going to give the orchard to charity?</font>

374
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:14,981
<font color="yellow">Each square foot of that orchard
costs over two thousand dollars!</font>

375
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:18,377
<font color="yellow">It's 3,000 square feet
so it's six million dollars!</font>

376
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:21,258
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything
when the six million dollar</font>

377
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:23,516
<font color="yellow">orchard is being given to
someone else we don't know?</font>

378
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:27,736
<font color="yellow">It's not being given
to people we don't know.</font>

379
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,783
<font color="yellow">It's for students
in difficult circumstances.</font>

380
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,611
<font color="yellow">It'll be given to a scholarship
foundation for those students.</font>

381
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:36,640
<font color="yellow">Why couldn't you tell him
to leave that be</font>

382
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:39,738
<font color="yellow">and give it to Hee-dong
and Hee-ra later on?</font>

383
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,072
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

384
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:43,212
<font color="yellow">Stop barking nonsense like a dog!</font>

385
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:46,891
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm a dog! Bark, bark, bark, bark!</font>

386
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,488
<font color="yellow">Can't you listen to
my nonsense for once?</font>

387
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:51,307
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

388
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,974
<font color="yellow">Stop thinking such stupid things
and just go home and prepare food!</font>

389
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,905
<font color="yellow">Elder has no appetite lately,
so he can't eat well.</font>

00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,541
<font color="yellow">Six...</font>

391
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:05,353
<font color="yellow">Six million dollars...</font>

392
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:09,734
<font color="yellow">There goes my six million dollars!</font>

393
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,390

<font color="yellow">Maple leaf.</font>

395
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,497
<font color="yellow">Why did that have to appear again?</font>

00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:27,877
<font color="yellow">I'm done for.</font>

397
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:33,458
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was just bored.</font>

398
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:36,189
<font color="yellow">I was trying it out for luck.</font>

399
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:41,467
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't turn this
song on in my house!</font>

400
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:44,947
<font color="yellow">I'm sick and tired of this song!</font>

401

to be a hundred years old?</font>

446
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,551
<font color="yellow">The turn signals are coming on,
so it's not a battery problem.</font>

447
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,153
<font color="yellow">It worked fine before.</font>

448
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:27,223
<font color="yellow">Why is it suddenly not working?</font>

449
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:33,014
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

450
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,015
<font color="yellow">I think this may be the problem.</font>

451
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:44,476
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

452
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:46,132
<font color="yellow">Fuse.</font>

453
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:50,276
<font color="yellow">I think there was a wire here somewhere.</font>

454
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:54,984
<font color="yellow">This will do.</font>

455
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:03,984
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

456
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:15,906
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

457
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,489
<font color="yellow">How did you do that?</font>

458
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:22,998
<font color="yellow">It works, thanks to you!</font>

459
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:27,339
<font color="yellow">I made it so that the engine can turn on.
This is just temporary, so hurry up and</font>

460
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:30,998
<font color="yellow">take it to a repair center. Change the fuse
and check if there are any other problems.</font>

461
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,302
<font color="yellow">Got it? You must do that.</font>

462
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:37,465
<font color="yellow">I got it. I understand what you
just said. Do you think I'm a baby?</font>

463
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:39,893
<font color="yellow">You're so clumsy.
That's why I'm doing this.</font>

464
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,359
<font color="yellow">Oh, Jang-go.</font>

465
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:45,289
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your shirt?</font>

466
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:48,414
<font color="yellow">When did this get on here?</font>

467
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:51,485
<font color="yellow">This seems like a grease stain.</font>

468
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:53,483
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

469
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,787
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Don't worry about it.</font>

470
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:58,452
<font color="yellow">It's grease, so it won't
be easy to take off.</font>

471
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,859
<font color="yellow">Your dress shirt is ruined.</font>

472
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:05,780
<font color="yellow">I said it's fine. Hurry up
and go to the repair center.</font>

473
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:08,342
<font color="yellow">No, I'll go with you. Lead the way.</font>

474
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:11,574
<font color="yellow">No. You should go back to work.</font>

475
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:14,715
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for taking up your time.</font>

476
00:32:20,663 --> 00:32:22,179
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, thank you so much.</font>

477
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,198
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you yummy
black bean noodles again!</font>

478
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,232
<font color="yellow">Hey, tell them to thoroughly check it!</font>

479
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:34,321
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, thank you!</font>

480
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:40,367
<font color="yellow">Will she be okay?</font>

481
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:51,577
<font color="yellow">Drink slowly!</font>

482
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:55,557
<font color="yellow">If you mix drinks tomorrow,
you'll get a bad headache tomorrow!</font>

483
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:58,749
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's stop.</font>

484
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,351
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

485
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:08,178
<font color="yellow">I'm going to drink all
of this and then die.</font>

486
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:09,539
<font color="yellow">Crazy wench.</font>

487
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:11,947
<font color="yellow">How can you say that in front of me?</font>

488
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:13,679
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

489
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:19,663
<font color="yellow">I really can't live in
disgrace like this.</font>

490
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:28,975
<font color="yellow">I didn't even tell you half
of how I lived so far.</font>

491
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:36,772
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Chung-ja. You don't have to
tell me everything in order for me to know.</font>

492
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,795
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a fool?</font>

493
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:42,749
<font color="yellow">Sitting back and waiting
for something to happen is</font>

494
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:47,140
<font color="yellow">the most miserable and
pathetic thing you can do.</font>

495
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:52,742
<font color="yellow">It seems like it will happen,
but then it doesn't.</font>

496
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:58,794
<font color="yellow">That is a very frustrating
thing to deal with!</font>

497
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:06,617
<font color="yellow">So why would you just sit back and wait
for something to happen in the first place?</font>

498
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:14,077
<font color="yellow">Still, I thought that if
I sincerely tried my best,</font>

499
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:19,436
<font color="yellow">I thought I would
get something out of it.</font>

500
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:27,077
<font color="yellow">But since that's not happening,
I keep thinking these awful thoughts.</font>

501
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:30,924
<font color="yellow">- I keep wondering when that old fart will die!
- Oh my goodness!</font>

502
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:34,049
<font color="yellow">Hey! You shouldn't say that!</font>

503
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,789
<font color="yellow">What if someone hears you?</font>

504
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:42,067
<font color="yellow">Father said he won't die
unless there is a union.</font>

505
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:48,269
<font color="yellow">Mom, what do I do if there's no union?</font>

506
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,879
<font color="yellow">Our wish is to have a union.</font>

507
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:57,892
<font color="yellow">Our dream is also to have a union.</font>

508
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:04,646
<font color="yellow">- "We sincerely want a union."
- Goodness.</font>

509
00:35:05,264 --> 00:35:10,187
<font color="yellow">- "Let's accomplish a union."
- You must be mad!</font>

510
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:16,696
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja, what's wrong with you?
- "A union that will save the people."</font>

511
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:24,132
<font color="yellow">- "A union that will save Ma Chung-ja."
- Chung-ja!</font>

512
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:29,749
<font color="yellow">Mom, this is my favorite song to sing.</font>

513
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:34,866
<font color="yellow">So you must sing with me
with your utmost sincerity, okay?</font>

514
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:41,531
<font color="yellow">"Our wish is to have a union."</font>

515
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:48,341
<font color="yellow">"Our dream is to also have a union."</font>

516
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:54,757
<font color="yellow">"We sincerely want a union."</font>

517
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:58,840
<font color="yellow">"Let's accomplish a union."</font>

518
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:05,648
<font color="yellow">"A union that will save the people."</font>

519
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:11,901
<font color="yellow">"A union that will save this country."</font>

520
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:17,968
<font color="yellow">- "A union that will save Ma Chung-ja."
- Mother.</font>

521
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,679
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? What's all this?</font>

522
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:22,774
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja drank quite a lot.</font>

523
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:24,905
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop her, but she still...</font>

524
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:26,093
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

525
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:29,116
<font color="yellow">Honey, you're home?</font>

526
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:34,367
<font color="yellow">Look here, Jo Dal-ho.</font>

527
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:40,718
<font color="yellow">Where is Elder who is
your God and Buddha home?</font>

528
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:43,479
<font color="yellow">Did Elder come home, too?</font>

529
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,195
<font color="yellow">How much did you drink?
Where are you going in this state?</font>

530
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,788
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see the end of it today.</font>

531
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:54,876
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

532
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,568
<font color="yellow">I've got nothing to lose!</font>

533
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:59,012
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

534
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:00,413
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
- Father.</font>

535
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:02,434
<font color="yellow">- Chung-ja! Chung-ja!
- Honey! Honey!</font>

536
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:06,545
<font color="yellow">Yeah, go ahead and fight!</font>

537
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,255
<font color="yellow">How can you live so cheap like this?</font>

538
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:14,092
<font color="yellow">She needs to undo the knots and squeeze out
the festering wounds. She has no other choice.</font>

539
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:17,358
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
- Father!</font>

540
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:18,780
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

541
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,406
<font color="yellow">Have you gone mad?</font>

542
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,483
<font color="yellow">Yes, I have!</font>

543
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:27,244
<font color="yellow">I'm so mad that I can't
see anything right now.</font>

544
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,974
<font color="yellow">- So move.
- That's enough!</font>

545
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,854
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you going to hit me?</font>

546
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:37,976
<font color="yellow">You act like you're so kind.</font>

547
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,480
<font color="yellow">You act like you have no greed.</font>

548
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,366
<font color="yellow">You act like you're so generous.</font>

549
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:48,031
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jo Dal-ho, you're the worst.</font>

550
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:49,390
<font color="yellow">Why is it so noisy?</font>

551
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:51,487
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

552
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,000
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came out.</font>

553
00:37:55,968 --> 00:38:02,436
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you
until my eyes popped out.</font>

554
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:06,069
<font color="yellow">Ta-da! And you came out!</font>

555
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,929
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Chung-ja?</font>

556
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:11,273
<font color="yellow">Did you drink?</font>

557
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:14,968
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Elder.</font>

558
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,585
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

559
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:19,646
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell him!</font>

560
00:38:19,671 --> 00:38:21,028
<font color="yellow">- That's enough!
- Let her be!</font>

561
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:22,531
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

562
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:24,530
<font color="yellow">What did you need to tell me?</font>

563
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:26,898
<font color="yellow">Father,</font>

564
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,906
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

565
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,848
<font color="yellow">I'm so disappointed in you.</font>

566
00:38:35,484 --> 00:38:37,772
<font color="yellow">I'm so, so upset.</font>

567
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:46,295
<font color="yellow">You give the Yangpyeong orchard worth
six million dollars to others so easily...</font>

568
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:52,731
<font color="yellow">but why are you so stingy to us,
who is like your family?</font>

569
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,399
<font color="yellow">When my father-in-law passed away,</font>

570
00:38:57,592 --> 00:39:00,768
<font color="yellow">you promised him...</font>

571
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,939
<font color="yellow">that you would take care of Dal-ho...</font>

572
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,382
<font color="yellow">like he was your biological son.</font>

573
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,646
<font color="yellow">But right now...</font>

574
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,992
<font color="yellow">I'm living in debt.</font>

575
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,648
<font color="yellow">In debt.</font>

576
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:22,171
<font color="yellow">Father,</font>

577
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,425
<font color="yellow">I'm just your daughter-in-law by label.</font>

578
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:31,249
<font color="yellow">I'm living a shabby life right now!</font>

579
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:36,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you in debt?
What's so shabby about your life?</font>

580
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:38,314
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- Enough.</font>

581
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,114
<font color="yellow">You just stay still.</font>

582
00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:50,725
<font color="yellow">Father, can't you give us some of
your enormous inheritance in advance?</font>

583
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:54,003
<font color="yellow">Is it because we're not
your biological family?</font>

584
00:39:55,406 --> 00:40:00,101
<font color="yellow">If we were, you would have already given
some of it to us and taken care of us.</font>

585
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:03,423
<font color="yellow">Is it because we're
your distant relatives?</font>

586
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:07,551
<font color="yellow">Please give us a little bit
of your inheritance.</font>

587
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:15,921
<font color="yellow">If you give us just a little bit of it,
I'll be able to live in peace.</font>

588
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:17,318
<font color="yellow">Father,</font>

589
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:25,867
<font color="yellow">it's not like you're going to take
that enormous inheritance with you.</font>

590
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:33,255
<font color="yellow">You think of us as strangers.</font>

591
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:34,873
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

592
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:37,815
<font color="yellow">Or else you wouldn't
be able to do this to us!</font>

593
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:42,404
<font color="yellow">If you had really thought
of us as your family, you</font>

594
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:46,107
<font color="yellow">would've given us some
of your inheritance already!</font>

595
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,903
<font color="yellow">Am I not right?</font>

596
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:49,638
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja!</font>

597
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:52,407
<font color="yellow">How dare you speak to him like that!</font>

598
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:53,755
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

599
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,528
<font color="yellow">Did I say something wrong?</font>

600
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:00,192
<font color="yellow">Tell me what I said that was wrong.
Tell me, you horrible man!</font>

601
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:05,090
<font color="yellow">Jo Dal-ho! You're the worst! You're-</font>

602
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:19,739
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

603
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:24,663
<font color="yellow">She should have gone easy on him
without crossing the line. Oh my goodness!</font>

604
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,543
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
- Hi! Good job today! Bye!</font>

605
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:56,503
<font color="yellow">It's grease, so it won't
be easy to take off.</font>

606
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,447
<font color="yellow">Your dress shirt is ruined.</font>

607
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,114
<font color="yellow">I said it's fine. Hurry up
and go to the repair center.</font>

608
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,779
<font color="yellow">Jang-go!</font>

609
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:23,180
<font color="yellow">Do you still go on the slides?</font>

610
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:25,601
<font color="yellow">You should try it, too.</font>

611
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:26,950
<font color="yellow">It's really fun.</font>

612
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:29,325
<font color="yellow">But why did you call me out this late?</font>

613
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:31,599
<font color="yellow">Is there something else
wrong with the motorcycle?</font>

614
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:33,364
<font color="yellow">Is there another problem
besides the fuse?</font>

615
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,389
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

616
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,953
<font color="yellow">The motorcycle is working well,
thanks to you.</font>

617
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:40,939
<font color="yellow">I didn't call you out for that.
I'm grateful to you for many things,</font>

618
00:42:40,964 --> 00:42:43,741
<font color="yellow">but I was only able to
buy you black bean noodles.</font>

619
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,660
<font color="yellow">I felt bad for ruining
your dress shirt earlier.</font>

620
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,599
<font color="yellow">So? Are you going
to make me a dress shirt?</font>

621
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,653
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

622
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:55,497
<font color="yellow">You were serious?</font>

623
00:42:55,927 --> 00:42:57,819
<font color="yellow">I was just joking around.</font>

624
00:42:58,513 --> 00:43:00,511
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm serious.
Do you think I'm lying?</font>

625
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,310
<font color="yellow">I need to measure you so stand still.</font>

626
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:06,421
<font color="yellow">Yeah, right. You really know
how to make a dress shirt?</font>

627
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:08,993
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I told you to stand still.</font>

628
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,521
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Stand still!</font>

629
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:23,372
<font color="yellow">How can you be more
disobedient than Yoo-sung?</font>

630
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:26,276
<font color="yellow">That's because it's tickles.</font>

631
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:28,858
<font color="yellow">I didn't tickle you,
so why do you feel ticklish?</font>

632
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:31,675
<font color="yellow">If I get the sizing wrong,
the shirt won't fit.</font>

633
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:33,386
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're a baby.</font>

634
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:02,673
<font color="yellow">I got your sizes, so I'll be going now.</font>

635
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,158
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong!</font>

636
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,005
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

637
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:10,872
<font color="yellow">How can you go home alone
after you called me out?</font>

638
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,365
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong! Kim Mi-poong!</font>

639
00:44:14,974 --> 00:44:16,372
<font color="yellow">I said wait for me!</font>

640
00:45:13,162 --> 00:45:15,771
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo,
what are you thinking about?</font>

641
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:17,848
<font color="yellow">You don't need to think of that woman.</font>

642
00:45:18,435 --> 00:45:22,493
<font color="yellow">I bought her beer, carried her on my back,
patted her back because she was throwing</font>

643
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:26,140
<font color="yellow">up, and slept with her at the motel just
in case something happened to her!</font>

644
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:31,149
<font color="yellow">How can she disappear
without saying thank you?</font>

645
00:45:32,802 --> 00:45:37,052
<font color="yellow">Anyways, women can't be trusted.</font>

646
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,807
<font color="yellow">They're the icon of betrayer.
Icon of betrayer!</font>

647
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:44,461
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, what are you
mumbling about to yourself?</font>

648
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:46,130
<font color="yellow">Gosh! I don't know.</font>

649
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,729
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, give me your cell-phone.</font>

650
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,927
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

651
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:58,318
<font color="yellow">The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.</font>

652
00:45:59,294 --> 00:46:01,694
<font color="yellow">Darn it. Where did my cell-phone go?</font>

653
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:03,849
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

654
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:05,049
<font color="yellow">Did you lose your cell-phone?</font>

655
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:06,719
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I don't know.</font>

656
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,185
<font color="yellow">Nothing works out for me.</font>

657
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:12,929
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wash.</font>

658
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:14,573
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jang-go.</font>

659
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:17,010
<font color="yellow">Do I look very dirty?</font>

660
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:18,035
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

661
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,940
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

662
00:46:49,424 --> 00:46:52,065
<font color="yellow">She better not make
an awful dress shirt.</font>

663
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:10,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

664
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:14,124
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, father.</font>

665
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,042
<font color="yellow">I can't believe
I was drunk in front of you.</font>

666
00:47:21,932 --> 00:47:23,705
<font color="yellow">I must have been out of my mind.</font>

667
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,269
<font color="yellow">I was very wrong.</font>

668
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,315
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me this once.</font>

669
00:47:30,393 --> 00:47:31,393
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

670
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:36,150
<font color="yellow">How much is your debt?</font>

671
00:47:36,823 --> 00:47:37,823
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

672
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:39,502
<font color="yellow">Debt?</font>

673
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:40,916
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

674
00:47:41,112 --> 00:47:43,556
<font color="yellow">I don't have any debt, father.</font>

675
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,924
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

676
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:54,474
<font color="yellow">No, I'll take care of it.</font>

677
00:47:55,198 --> 00:47:57,131
<font color="yellow">How will you take care of it?</font>

678
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,799
<font color="yellow">Did you throw that fit yesterday
because you could take care of it?</font>

679
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:02,894
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and tell me.</font>

680
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:04,852
<font color="yellow">How much is your debt?</font>

681
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:09,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, well, the thing is...</font>

682
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:12,237
<font color="yellow">It's roughly around $30,000...</font>

683
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,299
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to tell me an estimate!</font>

684
00:48:17,283 --> 00:48:20,080
<font color="yellow">Tell me honestly how much it is.</font>

685
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:23,353
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

686
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:29,642
<font color="yellow">in order to cleanly repay all of it...</font>

687
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:34,268
<font color="yellow">I need $50,000.</font>

688
00:48:35,158 --> 00:48:37,596
<font color="yellow">$50,000?</font>

689
00:48:41,236 --> 00:48:42,563
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's $50,000?</font>

690
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:44,799
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

691
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:50,799
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

692
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,844
<font color="yellow">I'll repay that for you,</font>

693
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:58,091
<font color="yellow">so make sure something
like this happens again.</font>

694
00:48:59,846 --> 00:49:00,846
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

695
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,073
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

696
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,330
<font color="yellow">but the thing is...</font>

697
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:07,901
<font color="yellow">I swear to God...</font>

698
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:11,448
<font color="yellow">that I was first in debt
because I had to send</font>

699
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:13,953
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra money for her
living expenses to live abroad.</font>

700
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:21,096
<font color="yellow">Then I was buying good things for
my family. That's why I became like this.</font>

701
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:24,723
<font color="yellow">I never wasted money on strange things.</font>

702
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,424
<font color="yellow">Please believe that at least.</font>

703
00:49:27,987 --> 00:49:28,987
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

704
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:30,788
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work.</font>

705
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:31,813
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

706
00:49:32,454 --> 00:49:34,174
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry, father.</font>

707
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:42,929
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'm really sorry.</font>

708
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:49,241
<font color="yellow">So please don't be angry
and talk to father for me.</font>

709
00:49:50,065 --> 00:49:51,713
<font color="yellow">You'll do that for me, won't you?</font>

710
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:58,194
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

711
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:05,705
<font color="yellow">Welcome!</font>

712
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,233
<font color="yellow">Did the buttons I ordered come out?</font>

713
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:10,125
<font color="yellow">Of course they did. Hold on.</font>

714
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,479
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

715
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:27,260
<font color="yellow">May I sew on the buttons here?</font>

716
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:28,899
<font color="yellow">- Of course.
- Thank you.</font>

717
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,252
<font color="yellow">You really made this?</font>

718
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,370
<font color="yellow">So, do you like it?</font>

719
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:13,268
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

720
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,767
<font color="yellow">I like the color, too.</font>

721
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:21,349
<font color="yellow">Did you buy this
and lie that you made it?</font>

722
00:51:22,151 --> 00:51:24,830
<font color="yellow">No, I really made everything.</font>

723
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:27,910
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that
I sewed on the buttons, too?</font>

724
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:34,155
<font color="yellow">You were serious.</font>

725
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,263
<font color="yellow">Then this is a
one-of-a-kind dress shirt.</font>

726
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:40,804
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right!</font>

727
00:51:42,323 --> 00:51:43,323
<font color="yellow">Awesome.</font>

728
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:48,510
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

729
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:51,405
<font color="yellow">I need to check if it fits or not.</font>

730
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,677
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Turn around.</font>

731
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:00,299
<font color="yellow">You don't have to check.
The size should be just right.</font>

732
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:02,553
<font color="yellow">What do you take my skills for?</font>

733
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,193
<font color="yellow">I have to wear it to
check if it fits me or not.</font>

734
00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:11,939
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my heart?</font>

735
00:52:12,673 --> 00:52:15,065
<font color="yellow">It's acting up again on
its own like old times.</font>

736
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:17,183
<font color="yellow">Jang-go will be able
to hear my heartbeat.</font>

737
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:24,815
<font color="yellow">You were right.</font>

738
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:27,870
<font color="yellow">The arms are just right,
and so is the chest.</font>

739
00:52:29,877 --> 00:52:31,179
<font color="yellow">You can turn around now.</font>

740
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,178
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

741
00:52:40,354 --> 00:52:42,036
<font color="yellow">You look amazing!</font>

742
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,256
<font color="yellow">It's not because you're good
at making clothes.</font>

743
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:47,636
<font color="yellow">It's because I look good in any clothes.</font>

744
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:49,869
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

745
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:54,192
<font color="yellow">I mean, think about it. Would the shirt
look so good if the body didn't?</font>

746
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,567
<font color="yellow">Fine. You have a great body.</font>

747
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,049
<font color="yellow">Happy now?</font>

748
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,330
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

749
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:05,260
<font color="yellow">But seriously I think it's nicer
than the clothes I buy.</font>

750
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:07,612
<font color="yellow">I love it.</font>

751
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,987
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you love it.</font>

752
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,190
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

753
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,595
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat dinner.</font>

754
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:20,519
<font color="yellow">You gifted me a handmade dress shirt.
I should buy you dinner.</font>

755
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,573
<font color="yellow">Dinner?</font>

756
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:23,598
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

757
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,527
<font color="yellow">- If you need anymore side dishes, let me know.
- Please give us premium ribs.</font>

758
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:33,557
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

759
00:53:33,582 --> 00:53:35,585
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo, clean up over there.</font>

760
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:41,318
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, please give us two
more servings of premium ribs.</font>

761
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:45,236
<font color="yellow">Okay, please hold on.</font>

762
00:53:45,565 --> 00:53:48,475
<font color="yellow">- Welcome!
- Ms. Joo, get them two bottles of soju.</font>

763
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:52,516
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- Over there.</font>

764
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:57,642
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy.
- Ms. Joo, get them more side dishes.</font>

765
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:04,021
<font color="yellow">Lady!</font>

766
00:54:04,112 --> 00:54:06,115
<font color="yellow">- What do I do?
- We're sorry!</font>

767
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,268
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? We're sorry!</font>

768
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,734
<font color="yellow">I'm going nuts!</font>

769
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:15,383
<font color="yellow">- Forget it!
- I'm sorry.</font>

770
00:54:15,408 --> 00:54:16,533
<font color="yellow">How annoying!</font>

771
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,885
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

772
00:54:21,854 --> 00:54:23,781
<font color="yellow">I'll clean it up.</font>

773
00:54:39,737 --> 00:54:41,873
<font color="yellow">I'm so stunned.</font>

774
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,235
<font color="yellow">This is the first time
this has happened to me.</font>

775
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:48,475
<font color="yellow">No more excuses.
Quit right this instant.</font>

776
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:52,022
<font color="yellow">If I continue to work with you,
I'm going to get sick!</font>

777
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:27,101
<font color="yellow">It's Mi-jung. Mi-jung, that witch.</font>

778
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,249
<font color="yellow">Kang Mi-jung, that awful witch.</font>

779
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:41,371
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

780
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:55,244
<font color="yellow">Kang Mi-jung!</font>

781
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:02,903
<font color="yellow">You witch! Give me my money back!</font>

782
00:56:02,928 --> 00:56:04,388
<font color="yellow">Someone save me!</font>

783
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:10,138
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

784
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,238
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

785
00:56:13,263 --> 00:56:14,473
<font color="yellow">You crazy bitch!</font>

786
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:22,202
<font color="yellow">Who the hell do you think you are?</font>

787
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,758
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry!
- You're a psycho!</font>

788
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:30,611
<font color="yellow">Webfoot octopus?</font>

789
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:34,012
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll let you taste some
delicious webfoot octopus.</font>

790
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:36,950
<font color="yellow">It's a bit spicy, but it's delicious.</font>

791
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:40,401
<font color="yellow">My mom and Yoo-sung
likes webfoot octopus, too.</font>

792
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:41,810
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

793
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,232
<font color="yellow">We can order some for
them and take them home.</font>

794
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,066
<font color="yellow"><i>Jang-go, why are you
being so nice to me?</i></font>

795
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,911
<font color="yellow"><i>It's because I'm Yeong-cheol's sister, right?</i></font>

796
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:08,372
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

797
00:57:11,576 --> 00:57:12,576
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

798
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:14,591
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

799
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:16,881
<font color="yellow">Joo Young-ae is my mom.</font>

800
00:57:19,255 --> 00:57:20,922
<font color="yellow">What? The police station?</font>

801
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:27,269
<font color="yellow">How can she start a fight
in the middle of street?</font>

802
00:57:27,513 --> 00:57:29,046
<font color="yellow">Please take care of it.</font>

803
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:31,537
<font color="yellow">You should just settle
an agreement with her.</font>

804
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:41,771
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

805
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:46,645
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

806
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,040
<font color="yellow">What happened to your face?</font>

807
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,327
<font color="yellow">Did that woman do something to you?</font>

808
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:57,490
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

809
00:57:58,068 --> 00:57:59,068
<font color="yellow">It's my fault.</font>

810
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:01,438
<font color="yellow">She didn't do anything wrong.</font>

811
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:06,677
<font color="yellow">Then you really grabbed her hair first?</font>

812
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:08,914
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that? Why?</font>

813
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:17,087
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

814
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:18,810
<font color="yellow">Kang Mi-jung!</font>

815
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,888
<font color="yellow">I thought she was her!</font>

816
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:26,094
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

817
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:28,388
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

818
00:58:29,646 --> 00:58:34,591
<font color="yellow">I really saw her! I really saw Mi-jung!</font>

819
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,497
<font color="yellow">I'm serious, Mi-poong!</font>

820
00:58:36,529 --> 00:58:38,064
<font color="yellow">I really saw her!</font>

821
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:53,591
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong...</font>

822
00:58:54,529 --> 00:58:56,241
<font color="yellow">I really saw her.</font>

823
00:58:57,115 --> 00:58:59,737
<font color="yellow">I really did see Kang Mi-jung.</font>

824
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:20,903
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

825
00:59:21,576 --> 00:59:23,177
<font color="yellow">- Are you here for autumn clothes?
- Yes.</font>

826
00:59:23,451 --> 00:59:25,224
<font color="yellow">Many new clothes are over there.</font>

827
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:33,357
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

828
00:59:34,193 --> 00:59:36,332
<font color="yellow">we decided to forget about Kang Mi-jung.</font>

829
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:38,757
<font color="yellow">How can I forget that witch?</font>

830
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:43,599
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for her, we wouldn't
have been living pathetically like this.</font>

831
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:49,083
<font color="yellow">She stole our bag full of money,
which is why we're suffering here like this.</font>

832
00:59:49,576 --> 00:59:53,669
<font color="yellow">Still, how could you grab
someone else's hair like that?</font>

833
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:56,967
<font color="yellow">I definitely saw Kang Mi-jung.</font>

834
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,883
<font color="yellow">She must have been living well
with our money because</font>

835
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:03,855
<font color="yellow">she looked Ike she was
some wealthy family's daughter.</font>

836
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,880
<font color="yellow">I'm serious! I really saw her!</font>

837
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:07,936
<font color="yellow">You made a mistake.</font>

838
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,341
<font color="yellow">You couldn't forget Mi-jung
and keep thinking</font>

839
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:13,558
<font color="yellow">about the past.
That's why this happened.</font>

840
01:00:14,622 --> 01:00:15,622
<font color="yellow">Same goes for today.</font>

841
01:00:16,122 --> 01:00:19,740
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for Jang-go,
you would've gone to prison for assault!</font>

842
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:36,076
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, take a look at this ring.</font>

843
01:00:36,404 --> 01:00:39,887
<font color="yellow">When your grandmother was alive,
she used to wear this on her finger.</font>

844
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:43,506
<font color="yellow">You see this, don't you? You see
the symbol for "Cheon," right?</font>

845
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,134
<font color="yellow">What does this mean?</font>

846
01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:52,717
<font color="yellow">Could this Cheon be part
of your grandfather's name?</font>

847
01:00:53,123 --> 01:00:54,123
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

848
01:00:56,755 --> 01:01:00,197
<font color="yellow">Don't you think there was a reason</font>

849
01:01:00,738 --> 01:01:05,104
<font color="yellow">why your father gave this
to me before he died?</font>

850
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:07,605
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee,</font>

851
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:09,928
<font color="yellow">think about it carefully one more time.</font>

852
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:14,870
<font color="yellow">Your father told us to go find your grandfather
who lives in South Korea!</font>

853
01:01:15,307 --> 01:01:16,724
<font color="yellow">Did you really not hear that?</font>

854
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:20,292
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to
tell you that I didn't hear that?</font>

855
01:01:20,753 --> 01:01:23,839
<font color="yellow">It seemed as if you forgot about it,
but why do you keep doing this?</font>

856
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,280
<font color="yellow">If I don't find Kang Mi-jung,</font>

857
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,260
<font color="yellow">I'm going to find your grandfather.</font>

858
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:31,976
<font color="yellow">I can't live like this any longer!</font>

859
01:01:33,644 --> 01:01:37,208
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, why do we have
to live here like this?</font>

860
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:38,535
<font color="yellow">Who are we?</font>

861
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:43,245
<font color="yellow">We come from a heroic family that
everyone respected in North Korea!</font>

862
01:01:43,605 --> 01:01:48,902
<font color="yellow">But those people lower
than dirt disrespect us!</font>

863
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:52,117
<font color="yellow">Mom, please stop!</font>

864
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,362
<font color="yellow">If you were going to be like this,
why did you come here?</font>

865
01:01:56,497 --> 01:01:58,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave our home country?</font>

866
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,167
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to come here either.</font>

867
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:06,667
<font color="yellow">But I believed that there was a reason
why father wanted to leave home.</font>

868
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:09,195
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one having a hard time?</font>

869
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:10,839
<font color="yellow">I'm having a hard time, too.</font>

870
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:13,331
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one being disrespected?</font>

871
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,855
<font color="yellow">I'm disrespected every single day!</font>

872
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:18,269
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

873
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:21,330
<font color="yellow">I endure thinking of father.</font>

874
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:27,684
<font color="yellow">I think it's self-respect for me to
survive here just like father wanted me to.</font>

875
01:02:28,714 --> 01:02:31,731
<font color="yellow">But I can't do this anymore either.</font>

876
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,380
<font color="yellow">If you're going to be like this,</font>

877
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:37,925
<font color="yellow">go back home, even if you might
die on your way back there. No!</font>

878
01:02:38,808 --> 01:02:42,214
<font color="yellow">You're going to die going there anyways,
so let's just die here together!</font>

879
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:44,956
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, no.</font>

880
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,320
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Let go!</font>

881
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:52,261
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, I was wrong.
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.</font>

882
01:02:52,286 --> 01:02:53,286
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

883
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:54,932
<font color="yellow">Just die!</font>

884
01:02:54,957 --> 01:02:58,464
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was wrong.</font>

885
01:02:58,489 --> 01:03:00,727
<font color="yellow">Seung-hee, I was wrong.</font>

886
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:03,618
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Seung-hee.</font>

887
01:03:08,378 --> 01:03:11,331
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Seung-hee.
I'm sorry, Seung-hee.</font>

888
01:03:11,356 --> 01:03:15,480
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

889
01:03:20,612 --> 01:03:23,090
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Seung-hee.</font>

890
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:38,839
<font color="yellow">Oh, Elder.</font>

891
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:42,170
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here in the darkness?</font>

892
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:44,496
<font color="yellow">Are you drinking?</font>

893
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:46,222
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

894
01:03:47,464 --> 01:03:50,750
<font color="yellow">I had something to tell you anyways.</font>

895
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:52,238
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

896
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:53,910
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

897
01:03:59,558 --> 01:04:00,630
<font color="yellow">I'll pour it for you.</font>

898
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:16,011
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho.</font>

899
01:04:17,362 --> 01:04:18,766
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

900
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:22,390
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that, Elder?</font>

901
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:26,922
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja was right.</font>

902
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:30,550
<font color="yellow">All this time,</font>

903
01:04:32,066 --> 01:04:34,327
<font color="yellow">I said that I think of you as my child,</font>

904
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:38,140
<font color="yellow">but I hadn't actually
accept you as my child.</font>

905
01:04:40,363 --> 01:04:42,546
<font color="yellow">I think I only thought
of you as a nephew.</font>

906
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,911
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm sorry.</font>

907
01:04:46,988 --> 01:04:48,253
<font color="yellow">Come on, Elder.</font>

908
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:51,614
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if
I'm your nephew or son.</font>

909
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:56,132
<font color="yellow">I'm just grateful I can live with you.</font>

910
01:04:56,894 --> 01:05:00,740
<font color="yellow">And the incident with
Chung-ja was my fault.</font>

911
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:02,496
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

912
01:05:03,785 --> 01:05:04,785
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

913
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:11,722
<font color="yellow">I think I did something wrong
to you, and I feel embarrassed.</font>

914
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:14,584
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

915
01:05:16,574 --> 01:05:17,574
<font color="yellow">I wanted to...</font>

916
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:20,292
<font color="yellow">officially...</font>

917
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:25,540
<font color="yellow">adopt you as my son.</font>

918
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,511
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

919
01:05:33,957 --> 01:05:35,357
<font color="yellow">Adopt me as your son?</font>

920
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:37,636
<font color="yellow">Adopt...?</font>

921
01:05:41,996 --> 01:05:43,262
<font color="yellow">Adopt him as a son?</font>

922
01:05:57,783 --> 01:05:59,379
<font color="yellow">(Blow Breeze)</font>

923
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:04,387
<font color="yellow">Mi-jung stole that bag full of
money that my father left for us.</font>

924
01:06:04,412 --> 01:06:07,221
<font color="yellow">Is he really the second son
of Daelhyong Group?</font>

925
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:10,219
<font color="yellow">It worked effectively!</font>

926
01:06:10,244 --> 01:06:13,735
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't lose to
a few glasses of soju!</font>

927
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,173
<font color="yellow">Is that true? Are you serious?</font>
