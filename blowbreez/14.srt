<font color="yellow">It's true!</font>

00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,770
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

6
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:18,442
<font color="yellow">Marriage registration?</font>

7
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:20,684
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

8
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:24,785
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, what's this?</font>

9
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:29,184
<font color="yellow">No, no! Don't listen to this crap!</font>

10
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:32,723
<font color="yellow">This is fraud! This is invalid!</font>

11
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:36,151
<font color="yellow">This is invalid!</font>

12
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:39,274
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

13
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,841
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

14
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:41,866
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

15
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,861
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, why?</font>

16
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,590
<font color="yellow">Why would you do something
like this without even telling me?</font>

17
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:51,713
<font color="yellow">Are you an orphan?</font>

18
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,606
<font color="yellow">Or do I mean nothing to you?</font>

19
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:58,317
<font color="yellow">Dad, it's not like that.</font>

20
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,561
<font color="yellow">I love you so much.</font>

21
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:04,369
<font color="yellow">I didn't do this to disappoint you.</font>

22
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:09,978
<font color="yellow">For the first time, I fell in love,
but mom won't acknowledge us,</font>

23
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,549
<font color="yellow">and all she does is disrespect us
and disapprove of us!</font>

24
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,315
<font color="yellow">That's why I did this.</font>

25
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,102
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

26
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,287
<font color="yellow">Since things already turned out
this way, why don't</font>

27
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:24,224
<font color="yellow">you have a seat so that
we can discuss this?</font>

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,917
<font color="yellow">Why would we sit down?</font>

29
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,832
<font color="yellow">You thieves! You con-artists!</font>

30
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:34,234
<font color="yellow">You did this, didn't you?
You planned all this, didn't you?</font>

31
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:35,973
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

32
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:38,848
<font color="yellow">You're too much.</font>

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,683
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to Jang-soo's
mother that way!</font>

34
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:46,984
<font color="yellow">She told us to do things in order
and get your permission first!</font>

35
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:50,434
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything, so why
are you talking that way to her?</font>

36
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:52,106
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra!</font>

37
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:57,286
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, stop this madness!
Get a hold of yourself!</font>

38
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,026
<font color="yellow">Both of you just stay still!</font>

39
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:05,325
<font color="yellow">This doesn't make sense.
I can't acknowledge this.</font>

40
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,116
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-ra,
there's no need to discuss this.</font>

41
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:11,279
<font color="yellow">This marriage without the adults
knowing is unacceptable!</font>

42
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:12,803
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

43
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:17,857
<font color="yellow">I'm twenty-nine, not nineteen.</font>

44
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,896
<font color="yellow">I'm an adult, and Jang-soo
and I love each other.</font>

45
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,568
<font color="yellow">So please understand me.</font>

46
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:31,161
<font color="yellow">You want me to understand you
when you pulled something like this?</font>

47
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:34,693
<font color="yellow">You disrespected your parents, and yet,
you want us to understand you?</font>

48
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:37,154
<font color="yellow">You can't get married just
because you love each other!</font>

49
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,729
<font color="yellow">I don't need a daughter who
disrespects her parents anyways.</font>

50
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,379
<font color="yellow">Mother. Honey. Let's go.</font>

51
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:45,497
<font color="yellow">- Dad!
- Father!</font>

52
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:51,505
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, how can you betray me like this?</font>

53
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:59,498
<font color="yellow">Just pretend she died.
Enough talking. Let's go.</font>

54
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,445
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, let's go.</font>

55
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,549
<font color="yellow">Mom! Dad! I'm sorry!</font>

56
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:06,771
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry!</font>

57
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,459
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

58
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,951
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo.</font>

59
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:17,537
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra.</font>

60
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,991
<font color="yellow">Because you would be so upset...</font>

61
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:35,570
<font color="yellow">Because you would be so heartbroken...</font>

62
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,601
<font color="yellow">I was trying so hard to solve
this before you had to find out.</font>

63
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,894
<font color="yellow">Then this happened.</font>

64
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:46,846
<font color="yellow">Solve this?</font>

65
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:51,114
<font color="yellow">How? By making her leave the house
and get married without us knowing?</font>

66
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,069
<font color="yellow">What did you to do her?</font>

67
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:59,002
<font color="yellow">Dal-ho, how can you speak that way?</font>

68
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:03,279
<font color="yellow">Are you saying it's
Chung-ja's fault that Hee-ra</font>

69
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:06,459
<font color="yellow">got married to that good-for-nothing
bum without letting us know?</font>

70
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,672
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra isn't such a horrible girl.</font>

71
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:13,248
<font color="yellow">She did this because Chung-ja
had cornered her like a rat.</font>

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,325
<font color="yellow">You're too harsh.</font>

73
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:20,255
<font color="yellow">Do you know how heartbroken
Chung-ja is because of Hee-ra?</font>

74
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:24,045
<font color="yellow">We catch her, and she runs away.
We lock her up, and she runs away again.</font>

75
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:30,527
<font color="yellow">If you could open up her chest, you would
see her heart has turned rotten black!</font>

76
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:34,714
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one who's upset?</font>

77
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,661
<font color="yellow">I feel like dying right now.</font>

78
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,774
<font color="yellow">You know how I raised Hee-ra.</font>

79
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:48,195
<font color="yellow">She was going out with some good-for-
nothing bum. Was I supposed to just let them be?</font>

80
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,769
<font color="yellow">God! Move!</font>

81
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,014
<font color="yellow">What else can we do?</font>

82
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:20,279
<font color="yellow">We need to accept them.</font>

83
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, Geum-sil.</font>

84
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:27,122
<font color="yellow">If we help them out a little, they'll be able
to work hard and move out on their own.</font>

85
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,681
<font color="yellow">Are we a family that
can be so disrespected?</font>

86
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:39,216
<font color="yellow">We worked hard and lived
without any shame until now.</font>

87
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:40,779
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.</font>

88
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,337
<font color="yellow">But who is she to disrespect us?</font>

89
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,122
<font color="yellow">We get on by, and we have a house, too.</font>

90
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:50,468
<font color="yellow">You're completely right, and we don't
have anything to be ashamed about.</font>

91
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:53,472
<font color="yellow">But she's treating us like
we're thieves who stole</font>

92
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,912
<font color="yellow">her precious daughter!
How can she do that?</font>

93
00:05:57,662 --> 00:06:00,146
<font color="yellow">I completely lost interest
in Hee-ra, and</font>

94
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,852
<font color="yellow">I don't want her to be
part of our family either.</font>

95
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,483
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil, I'm furious, too.</font>

96
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:07,090
<font color="yellow">But if you think about it
in their shoes,</font>

97
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,233
<font color="yellow">I realize they have a right
to come out that way.</font>

98
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:12,025
<font color="yellow">She's the apple of their eye,
and they even sent her</font>

99
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,574
<font color="yellow">to study abroad.
How shocked they must be right now.</font>

100
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:17,225
<font color="yellow">Just understand them.</font>

101
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,540
<font color="yellow">If we chase them out,
they'll have nowhere else to go.</font>

102
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,802
<font color="yellow">Let's allow them to stay here
temporarily, Geum-sil.</font>

103
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:30,525
<font color="yellow">But where will they stay?
There are no more rooms.</font>

104
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,092
<font color="yellow">There is a room.</font>

105
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,014
<font color="yellow">You mean my room?</font>

106
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,562
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, here's water.</font>

107
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,534
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, I'm sorry.</font>

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,792
<font color="yellow">Because I insisted
we register for marriage,</font>

109
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,451
<font color="yellow">you were criticized.</font>

110
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:05,264
<font color="yellow">So you regret it?</font>

111
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,378
<font color="yellow">I'm not said because I regret it.</font>

112
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,896
<font color="yellow">I'm sad because I hurt my parents.</font>

113
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,250
<font color="yellow">Let's be happier then.</font>

114
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:33,154
<font color="yellow">Eventually, they'll find out
you're a good person.</font>

115
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:42,906
<font color="yellow">But it seemed like your grandmother,
mother, and aunt was really mad.</font>

116
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:45,018
<font color="yellow">What if we get kicked out of here, too?</font>

117
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:49,341
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, don't you remember
how we came here?</font>

118
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,748
<font color="yellow">My grandma dragged us here.</font>

119
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:54,577
<font color="yellow">Would she have done that if
they were going to kick us out?</font>

120
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:55,961
<font color="yellow">You're right!</font>

121
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:02,739
<font color="yellow">Don't cry, Hee-ra.</font>

122
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:03,764
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

123
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:08,171
<font color="yellow">What a sight!</font>

124
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,796
<font color="yellow">Close the door!</font>

125
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:18,163
<font color="yellow">I didn't even give them permission to use
my room, but they already took over it!</font>

126
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:22,646
<font color="yellow">I'm the greatest victim of this
marriage registration incident.</font>

127
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:26,351
<font color="yellow">Their parents won't last long.
No parents win over their children.</font>

128
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,746
<font color="yellow">I guess I need to sacrifice this
much for Jang-soo to become</font>

129
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,234
<font color="yellow">the son-in-law of a 100 million
dollar inheritance household.</font>

130
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:35,373
<font color="yellow">Later when Hee-ra gets her inheritance,
she won't forget me, right?</font>

131
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,572
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Now isn't the time for that!</font>

132
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:39,597
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

133
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:41,679
<font color="yellow">So immature.</font>

134
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,086
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

135
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,835
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Young-ae!
- Bye.</font>

136
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,143
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Bye. See you tomorrow.</font>

137
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,289
<font color="yellow">Did Yoo-sung and
Mi-poong eat dinner yet?</font>

138
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:01,863
<font color="yellow">Where did my cell-phone go?</font>

139
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,750
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

140
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,219
<font color="yellow">We locked the door, so why is it open?</font>

141
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,923
<font color="yellow">Did they not lock it?</font>

142
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:29,562
<font color="yellow">There it is!</font>

143
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:31,434
<font color="yellow">You must have left something.</font>

144
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:34,665
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

145
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,933
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Were you very surprised?</font>

146
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:44,484
<font color="yellow">No. I just didn't think
anyone would be here.</font>

147
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,991
<font color="yellow">I should have at least
left the lights on.</font>

148
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:51,385
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I left my cell-phone here.</font>

149
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:57,218
<font color="yellow">But why are you drinking alone
without any snacks in the darkness?</font>

150
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,976
<font color="yellow">Oh, I just wanted a drink.</font>

151
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,663
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and go home.</font>

152
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,716
<font color="yellow">I'll lock up before I go.</font>

153
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,468
<font color="yellow">How can I just go when you're drinking
alone without any snacks?</font>

154
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,589
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

155
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,295
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.</font>

156
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,484
<font color="yellow">Eat these.</font>

157
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:56,430
<font color="yellow">If you just drink soju without eating
any snacks, you'll get an upset stomach.</font>

158
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:59,604
<font color="yellow">I bothered you, Ms. Joo.</font>

159
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:04,061
<font color="yellow">Nonsense. Seasoned acorn jelly salad
is the easiest thing to make in this world.</font>

160
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:06,429
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

161
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,727
<font color="yellow">I will. Thank you, Ms. Joo.</font>

162
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,323
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo...</font>

163
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,468
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you're like this...</font>

164
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,843
<font color="yellow">but there can't only be
good days in our lives.</font>

165
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:31,938
<font color="yellow">Some days are sunny.</font>

166
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,553
<font color="yellow">Some days are rainy.</font>

167
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:39,984
<font color="yellow">It gets bright again and then suddenly
there are typhoons and landslides.</font>

168
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:44,499
<font color="yellow">That's life.</font>

169
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,249
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's true.</font>

170
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:51,102
<font color="yellow">There can't only be bright days.</font>

171
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:56,446
<font color="yellow">But after being hit with typhoons
and landslides out of the blue,</font>

172
00:11:57,242 --> 00:12:01,546
<font color="yellow">it makes me angry and wonder
if I lived a wrong life all along.</font>

173
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:07,593
<font color="yellow">I'm having such a difficult time
and feeling so angry today.</font>

174
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:10,202
<font color="yellow">Typhoons and landslides?</font>

175
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:16,179
<font color="yellow">My daughter secretly registered
for marriage with</font>

176
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,366
<font color="yellow">her boyfriend because
my wife disapproved of them.</font>

177
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:24,155
<font color="yellow">She secretly registered for marriage?</font>

178
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,343
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

179
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,929
<font color="yellow">Her parents are both alive and well...</font>

180
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:39,412
<font color="yellow">I never imagined my daughter, out of
all people, would betray me like this.</font>

181
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:43,869
<font color="yellow">I can't forgive her.</font>

182
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:51,374
<font color="yellow">This may be crossing the line,</font>

183
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:55,148
<font color="yellow">but she's the daughter
of a great man like you,</font>

184
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,761
<font color="yellow">I'm sure nothing will go wrong.</font>

185
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:00,054
<font color="yellow">You should trust her.</font>

186
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:04,464
<font color="yellow">She just has to live
a happy life, right?</font>

187
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:17,327
<font color="yellow">Our children just have
to be healthy and alive.</font>

188
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:20,447
<font color="yellow">Their mere existence should
make us feel grateful.</font>

189
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:28,422
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

190
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:31,390
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

191
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,835
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have brought this up.</font>

192
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

193
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:39,429
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

194
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:42,366
<font color="yellow">I didn't even offer you a drink.</font>

195
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,655
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo, have a drink.</font>

196
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,015
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

197
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:01,921
<font color="yellow">It's very hard living here, isn't it?</font>

198
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:08,390
<font color="yellow">I would be lying if I answered no.</font>

199
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:15,431
<font color="yellow">But because of people like you and
Mr. Kim who help and encourage me,</font>

<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

227

that up in front of me?</font>

<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

236
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,398
<font color="yellow">I was kidding.</font>

237
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:17,570

need to do is memorize the law.</font>

238
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,139
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

passion and principles.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm scouting you because
I see that kind of passion in you.</font>

241
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:31,939

some time to think about this.</font>

<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

248
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:56,538

but she's like my sister, so please be good to her.</font>

282
00:19:54,851 --> 00:20:00,916

did you become friends with her older brother?</font>

<font color="yellow">Maybe there will be a chance when
I can tell you that story in the future.</font>

He's your boyfriend, right?</font>

300
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,094
<font color="yellow">No! We're just friends!</font>

301
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:58,320
<font color="yellow">She said he's her friend,
not her boyfriend.</font>

302
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:00,826
<font color="yellow">Now, now. Should we have
a fun meeting while eating</font>

303
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,044
<font color="yellow">the cookies and coffee that
her friend bought for us?</font>

304
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,387
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Let's go.</font>

305
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:38,195
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, it's me.</font>

306
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:40,367
<font color="yellow">Hi, Shin-ae.</font>

307
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,125
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat dinner tonight?</font>

308
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,100
<font color="yellow">Shiitake mushrooms are good lately, so I was
going to make shiitake mushroom rice.</font>

309
00:21:47,383 --> 00:21:48,383
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

310
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:50,531
<font color="yellow">I have something to do today.</font>

311
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,301
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

312
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,046
<font color="yellow">Okay then. We'll eat together next time.</font>

313
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,015
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

314
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,366
<font color="yellow">How can he reject me?</font>

315
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
<font color="yellow">Jo Hee-dong, I thought
you had fallen for me.</font>

316
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,301
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

317
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,828
<font color="yellow">Is that man your older brother?</font>

318
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,206
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong is angry!</font>

319
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:57,859
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, never fight him, okay?</font>

320
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,284
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, don't worry!
My legs and arms are long!</font>

321
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,443
<font color="yellow">I'll protect you so that
he can't do anything to you.</font>

322
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,473
<font color="yellow">Is it you?</font>

323
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,616
<font color="yellow">The punk who caused trouble with Hee-ra?</font>

324
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,405
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am!</font>

325
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,171
<font color="yellow">But you're being too rude
when it's the first time we meet!</font>

326
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,826
<font color="yellow">"Trouble? Punk?"</font>

327
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:25,875
<font color="yellow">Are we middle school students?</font>

328
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,460
<font color="yellow">Bite down, you punk!</font>

329
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:34,773
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

330
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:39,538
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let go!</font>

331
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:41,391
<font color="yellow">I can't! I won't!</font>

332
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,258
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo!</font>

333
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,686
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, get a hold of yourself!</font>

334
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:57,961
<font color="yellow">Oh, no! Jang-soo!</font>

335
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:04,592
<font color="yellow">Who are you to hit my Jang-soo?</font>

336
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:06,800
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

337
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,695
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

338
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,255
<font color="yellow">So in other words, the two of you
didn't just do this thoughtlessly.</font>

339
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:20,242
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hee-dong.</font>

340
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,671
<font color="yellow">I really love Hee-ra.</font>

341
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:29,968
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

342
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:32,193
<font color="yellow">I'll trust your words.</font>

343
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,161
<font color="yellow">But if you make Hee-ra cry...</font>

344
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:39,378
<font color="yellow">I'll come back here again.</font>

345
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,062
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you never
have to come here again!</font>

346
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:45,367
<font color="yellow">I promise you, Hee-dong.</font>

347
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,311
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jo Hee-ra.
You did do wrong to our parents,</font>

348
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:00,672
<font color="yellow">so you better get on your knees
and apologize. Got it?</font>

349
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:02,695
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

350
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:07,981
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get going.</font>

351
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:12,422
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong.</font>

352
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:20,076
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live well, so don't worry.</font>

353
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,890
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

354
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:25,328
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

355
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,658
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo, are you all right?</font>

356
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:48,531
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

357
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:52,183
<font color="yellow">But is he usually like that?</font>

358
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:54,414
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

359
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:58,447
<font color="yellow">He's usually a stupid, gentle baby.
An extremely gentle baby.</font>

360
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,972
<font color="yellow">He only does that
when he's really angry.</font>

361
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,461
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

362
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:06,574
<font color="yellow">But he turns like that
when he becomes furious.</font>

363
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,782
<font color="yellow">It's the first time I see him
do a spinning kick today.</font>

364
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:15,603
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. Are you okay?</font>

365
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:21,695
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- The spinning kick...</font>

366
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:22,992
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

367
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,273
<font color="yellow">- That spinning kick...
- I know.</font>

368
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:33,412
<font color="yellow">- You got sand on you.
- I was so scared.</font>

369
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,418
<font color="yellow">I protected you though, didn't I?</font>

370
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:39,914
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

371
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:43,459
<font color="yellow">- Just trust me.
- Okay.</font>

372
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:06,883
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

373
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,988
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo, hurry up and come to my office!</font>

374
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:13,652
<font color="yellow">You know the outline you showed me
last time? Did you modify it?</font>

375
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,402
<font color="yellow">Bring me that! Hurry!</font>

376
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:17,543
<font color="yellow">Why out of the blue?</font>

377
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:20,773
<font color="yellow">I think there's a T.O on a zoisite.</font>

378
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:24,023
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

379
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:26,932
<font color="yellow">Yes! It's information
I just got right now!</font>

380
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,037
<font color="yellow">Let's put this in before
someone else fills up the spot!</font>

381
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,006
<font color="yellow">You need to start
publishing series now, right?</font>

382
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,989
<font color="yellow">I'll come right now!</font>

383
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:02,997
<font color="yellow">It can't just end like this.</font>

384
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,601
<font color="yellow">I can't give up on my daughter.</font>

385
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:17,648
<font color="yellow">(Ma Chung-ja)</font>

386
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:28,422
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

387
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

388
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,482
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you
about our kids, so come out.</font>

389
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,483
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you.</font>

390
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:39,713
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

391
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,985
<font color="yellow">What do you need to tell me?</font>

392
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:46,695
<font color="yellow">Geum-sil.</font>

393
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:51,619
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think
about this, this is wrong.</font>

394
00:28:52,703 --> 00:28:55,757
<font color="yellow">Why must our kids go
through such a marriage?</font>

395
00:28:57,593 --> 00:29:00,399
<font color="yellow">My husband said he would
never see Hee-ra again.</font>

396
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,175
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't cut off ties
between parents and children.</font>

397
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,373
<font color="yellow">People must live rationally.</font>

398
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:15,898
<font color="yellow">Your son and my daughter are quite old,
but they're still immature.</font>

399
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:19,054
<font color="yellow">That's why they caused
such a great incident.</font>

400
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,216
<font color="yellow">We learned that nothing good
comes out of living</font>

401
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:24,629
<font color="yellow">irrationally and cutting ties
off with our family.</font>

402
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:26,676
<font color="yellow">Do you think our kids will be happy?</font>

403
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,570
<font color="yellow">That's why we should support them.</font>

404
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:35,978
<font color="yellow">Why should we support them when this
was a wrong marriage from the beginning?</font>

405
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,807
<font color="yellow">This isn't rational!</font>

406
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:42,148
<font color="yellow">Then what are we supposed to do
if we don't support them?</font>

407
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,548
<font color="yellow">Either chase Hee-ra out,</font>

408
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:51,487
<font color="yellow">or if they can't separate,
chase both of them out.</font>

409
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,889
<font color="yellow">You want me to kick the
kids out of my house?</font>

410
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:56,589
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

411
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:02,281
<font color="yellow">Our kids are both jobless, so they
won't be able to last a long time.</font>

412
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:08,368
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra lived with money, so she won't
be able to survive a week without it.</font>

413
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,622
<font color="yellow">So do that for me, Geum-sil.</font>

414
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:14,539
<font color="yellow">Then I'll break them up no matter what.</font>

415
00:30:14,737 --> 00:30:18,270
<font color="yellow">So are you saying you want them
to have a divorce before</font>

416
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:21,393
<font color="yellow">their ink dries up on
their marriage registration?</font>

417
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,166
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

418
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:28,361
<font color="yellow">That's why we need to take care
of this before the ink dries up!</font>

419
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:29,853
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

420
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:34,769
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ma Chung-ja! You're too much!</font>

421
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:37,904
<font color="yellow">They didn't receive our permission
to register for marriage,</font>

422
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:41,666
<font color="yellow">but they're still a married couple by law.
Do you think divorce is that easy?</font>

423
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:43,291
<font color="yellow">Is divorce a kid's joke?</font>

424
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:45,350
<font color="yellow">I can never do that.</font>

425
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,002
<font color="yellow">Hwang Geum-sil.</font>

426
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:50,681
<font color="yellow">Oh, now your true colors come out.</font>

427
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:53,807
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

428
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:55,424
<font color="yellow">"True colors?"</font>

429
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:56,931
<font color="yellow">Yes! True colors!</font>

430
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:01,665
<font color="yellow">Are you secretly happy that
our kids registered for marriage?</font>

431
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,613
<font color="yellow">But don't even dream about it!</font>

432
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:07,806
<font color="yellow">If Hee-ra won't divorce your son,
then we'll cut off ties with her!</font>

433
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:11,158
<font color="yellow">She's not my daughter,
so she won't even get a penny!</font>

434
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,453
<font color="yellow">You wench!</font>

435
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:17,854
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

436
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:22,396
<font color="yellow">You awful wench.</font>

437
00:31:23,189 --> 00:31:24,618
<font color="yellow">How can you do this?</font>

438
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,416
<font color="yellow">Are you really a parent?</font>

439
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,902
<font color="yellow">What? It's rational to make
our kids get a divorce?</font>

440
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,962
<font color="yellow">I will never make them get a divorce.</font>

441
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,134
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of that daughter
you threw away like she's mine,</font>

442
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,691
<font color="yellow">so you go ahead and live well
with the inheritance your</font>

443
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:44,931
<font color="yellow">distant relative leaves behind,
you terrible wench!</font>

444
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:46,587
<font color="yellow">Horrible wench!</font>

445
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:48,228
<font color="yellow">Fine!</font>

446
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:53,829
<font color="yellow">I'm going to watch how long you
can last with my penniless daughter!</font>

447
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,329
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

448
00:31:56,423 --> 00:31:57,423
<font color="yellow">Witch!</font>

449
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,294
<font color="yellow">This blouse was so expensive!</font>

450
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,610
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

451
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:20,635
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

452
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,127
<font color="yellow">How is Mr. Park doing?</font>

453
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:26,593
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's his homesickness again.</font>

454
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,570
<font color="yellow">I heard he was being discharged today.</font>

455
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,146
<font color="yellow">I'm glad it's not a severe illness.</font>

456
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,949
<font color="yellow">So did Mr. Yang contact you?</font>

457
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:39,353
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

458
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:44,891
<font color="yellow">I guess. Only a few days have gone by.</font>

459
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:49,395
<font color="yellow">But is something wrong, Dal-ho?</font>

460
00:32:51,044 --> 00:32:53,246
<font color="yellow">Well, Elder...</font>

461
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,352
<font color="yellow">Um, I have something to tell you.</font>

462
00:32:58,098 --> 00:32:59,778
<font color="yellow">I think you should know about it, too.</font>

463
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:01,028
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

464
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:02,794
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

465
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:04,934
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra...</font>

466
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,778
<font color="yellow">left the house.</font>

467
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:10,770
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra left home?</font>

468
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:13,160
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

469
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,348
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

470
00:33:16,614 --> 00:33:19,377
<font color="yellow">They're not orphans.</font>

471
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,883
<font color="yellow">How can they register
for marriage by themselves?</font>

472
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,039
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

473
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,312
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

474
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:33,396
<font color="yellow">This happened because
I was lacking, father.</font>

475
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,173
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, father.</font>

476
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:42,629
<font color="yellow">Since things already
turned out this way,</font>

477
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,871
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you get them
officially married?</font>

478
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,458
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

479
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:50,145
<font color="yellow">Marry?</font>

480
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:57,544
<font color="yellow">If Hee-ra marries him,
her life will be worthless!</font>

481
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:01,821
<font color="yellow">How can I let that happen
as a parent? How?</font>

482
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,212
<font color="yellow">Those kids already became
a married couple by law.</font>

483
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:12,852
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to separate
them when they're in love...</font>

484
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:17,598
<font color="yellow">and make Hee-ra into a divorcee?</font>

485
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:20,897
<font color="yellow">Yes! That's better!</font>

486
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:26,422
<font color="yellow">Until this day, I never went
against your words,</font>

487
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:31,907
<font color="yellow">but even if you give them permission,
I won't be able to this time.</font>

488
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:34,596
<font color="yellow">I will never acknowledge
them even if I die!</font>

489
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:43,469
<font color="yellow">Elder, I can't forgive
Hee-ra yet either.</font>

490
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:45,056
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

491
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:47,155
<font color="yellow">Just leave this matter up to us.</font>

492
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:49,868
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

493
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:55,706
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra is your child, so it's only right
that you decide what to do with her.</font>

494
00:34:57,118 --> 00:35:01,485
<font color="yellow">Instead, tell me if you ever
need my help, Dal-ho.</font>

495
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:02,931
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

496
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,630
<font color="yellow">Are we just going home?</font>

497
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Tell me what you want.</font>

498
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:18,845
<font color="yellow">Should we get beer or soju today?</font>

499
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,110
<font color="yellow">Beer!</font>

500
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:23,662
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Mi-poong!</font>

501
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:26,847
<font color="yellow">He came again.</font>

502
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:29,961
<font color="yellow">- Go on.
- I don't think we can hang out today.</font>

503
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,469
<font color="yellow">Lucky.</font>

504
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,015
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

505
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,477
<font color="yellow">Did you wait for me all this time?</font>

506
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,053
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

507
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,087
<font color="yellow">I had some work to do nearby,
and it was time for you</font>

508
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:46,063
<font color="yellow">to go home, so I decided
to pick you up. Get in.</font>

509
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,149
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

510
00:35:57,445 --> 00:36:00,436
<font color="yellow">What's up with you today?
You got in without an argument.</font>

511
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:01,955
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and drive.</font>

512
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:04,164
<font color="yellow">Why? Is someone following you?</font>

513
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,565
<font color="yellow">Just go!</font>

514
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:07,516
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

515
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:17,687
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's wrong?</font>

516
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,142
<font color="yellow">People keep misunderstanding us
if they keep seeing us together.</font>

517
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:26,109
<font color="yellow">I thought it was something else.</font>

518
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:28,149
<font color="yellow">Just tell them I'm your friend.</font>

519
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,691
<font color="yellow">I did say that.</font>

520
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:36,452
<font color="yellow">But people keep misunderstanding us.</font>

521
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,224
<font color="yellow">They ask me what our relationship is.</font>

522
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:41,079
<font color="yellow">I wonder why they're
so curious about that.</font>

523
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:45,066
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll go to your office
tomorrow and clarify that</font>

524
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:48,024
<font color="yellow">I'm just your friend so that
they won't misunderstand.</font>

525
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,006
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

526
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,445
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I just don't
want to cause trouble for you.</font>

527
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:57,205
<font color="yellow">So what if you say that a hundred times?</font>

528
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:03,381
<font color="yellow">If there's weird rumors of me because of you and
I can't get married, will you take responsibility?</font>

529
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:06,773
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

530
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:12,172
<font color="yellow">You will?</font>

531
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:17,915
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll take responsibility and
send you off to marry a great guy.</font>

532
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,745
<font color="yellow">Hey, there's no guy like me out there.</font>

533
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,617
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

534
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,594
<font color="yellow">I'm so grateful.</font>

535
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:31,719
<font color="yellow">Then be good to me, and don't complain.</font>

536
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,983
<font color="yellow"><i>You fool. I'm so curious how
you managed to pass the bar exam</i></font>

537
00:37:36,008 --> 00:37:39,008
<font color="yellow"><i>when you're so dense that
you don't know a woman's heart.</i></font>

538
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,375
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

539
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,969
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

540
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:56,234
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm the fool for liking
such a clueless fool.</i></font>

541
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:01,945
<font color="yellow">Jang-soo!</font>

542
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,633
<font color="yellow">What do you think
about your new bedroom?</font>

543
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:09,255
<font color="yellow">- Grandma!
- Yes.</font>

544
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:17,435
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra, my mother-in-law and I prepared this
as quickly as we could. Do you like it?</font>

545
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:19,586
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

546
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:21,401
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

547
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:25,260
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? You don't like it?</font>

548
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:28,838
<font color="yellow">No, no!</font>

549
00:38:29,117 --> 00:38:32,966
<font color="yellow">I like it so much! I love it!</font>

550
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,422
<font color="yellow">Hey, aren't you going to give me a hug?</font>

551
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:38,219
<font color="yellow">I picked out all the colors.</font>

552
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:40,050
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

553
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:43,369
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Yes, yes.</font>

554
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:47,969
<font color="yellow">I know you guys wanted
something fancier, but what to do?</font>

555
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:51,172
<font color="yellow">You two registered for
marriage out of the blue,</font>

556
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,536
<font color="yellow">so even if you feel
disappointed, live well.</font>

557
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:59,686
<font color="yellow">Rather than wedding gifts,
it's better to live a happy life together!</font>

558
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:06,226
<font color="yellow">Yes! We'll have a happy life, grandma!
Thank you!</font>

559
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,910
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I'm so dizzy!</font>

560
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,930
<font color="yellow">Aunt, what's this?</font>

561
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:14,305
<font color="yellow">A gift from me.</font>

562
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,860
<font color="yellow">Can I open it?</font>

563
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:17,414
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

564
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:25,803
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty! I love it so much!
It's so cute! Right?</font>

565
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:31,164
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo.</font>

566
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:35,314
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo! Come out.
Let's have a beer party.</font>

567
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:39,394
<font color="yellow">A beer party? I love beer! Hooray!</font>

568
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,660
<font color="yellow">Hooray!</font>

569
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:45,069
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

570
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:46,094
<font color="yellow">Go out, mother.</font>

571
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:48,400
<font color="yellow">Mom, let's go!</font>

572
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:54,760
<font color="yellow">Here. A toast to Jang-soo's
happy honeymoon life!</font>

573
00:39:54,785 --> 00:39:57,054
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

574
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,923
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-soo, congratulations.</font>

575
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:04,746
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Congratulations.</font>

576
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:06,765
<font color="yellow">Thank you, brother-in-law!</font>

577
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:12,073
<font color="yellow">Look at her. She's like someone
who's been married for over one year.</font>

578
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:14,769
<font color="yellow">She says brother-in-law so easily!</font>

579
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,813
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

580
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,392
<font color="yellow">That's Hee-ra's charm!
To be truthful and lively!</font>

581
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:23,656
<font color="yellow">Thank you for knowing
my charming points, mother.</font>

582
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:29,011
<font color="yellow">She talks so smoothly with the
whole "brother-in-law, grandma,</font>

583
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:31,650
<font color="yellow">and mother" talk. She even
drinks her beer so smoothly!</font>

584
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,351
<font color="yellow">Are you a heavy drinker?</font>

585
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:41,289
<font color="yellow">I'm not a heavy drinker.
I'm just someone who loves beer.</font>

586
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,884
<font color="yellow">I love beer so much.</font>

587
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:44,610
<font color="yellow">That's how I met Jang-soo.</font>

588
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:49,904
<font color="yellow">I drank beer with Jang-soo, ended up
getting drunk, and went to a motel with him-</font>

589
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,720
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Good for you!</font>

590
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:54,223
<font color="yellow">Come on, Hee-ra, stop there.</font>

591
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:58,495
<font color="yellow">What do you mean stop there?
Tell us everything while you're at it.</font>

592
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:04,429
<font color="yellow">- Should I? Anyways, so what happened was...
- No! Stop! Stop!</font>

593
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,399
<font color="yellow">Aunt! Hee-ra!</font>

594
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:09,167
<font color="yellow">Come on.
She's going to spill everything!</font>

595
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,399
<font color="yellow">Let her be!</font>

596
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:12,963
<font color="yellow">How did you two meet?</font>

597
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:18,790
<font color="yellow">So we decided to just drink one bottle
of beer, but there was this game-</font>

598
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:22,442
<font color="yellow">- Hee-ra, stop right there!
- Why? They're family anyways.</font>

599
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:25,144
<font color="yellow">- Aunt!
- Keep spilling it!</font>

600
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:27,175
<font color="yellow">While you're at it, spill everything!</font>

601
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,413
<font color="yellow">- I'll finish it after I drink this.
- Sure, go ahead.</font>

602
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:30,704
<font color="yellow">One shot! One shot!</font>

603
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,782
<font color="yellow">- One shot!
- One shot!</font>

604
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:35,250
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- One shot!</font>

605
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:37,431
<font color="yellow">I think this family is in big trouble.</font>

606
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

607
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:44,056
<font color="yellow">So spill it.</font>

608
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:46,322
<font color="yellow">Come on, Nam-yi! Stop it!</font>

609
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:02,602
<font color="yellow">Seems like the owner's family
is having a blast.</font>

610
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:04,953
<font color="yellow">Something good must have happened.</font>

611
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,467
<font color="yellow">Did Jang-go's brother get married?</font>

612
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:10,689
<font color="yellow">The girl's family was against it.</font>

613
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:14,504
<font color="yellow">I think they just decided
to live together.</font>

614
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,212
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

615
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,196
<font color="yellow">Even though they didn't
officially get married,</font>

616
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:26,880
<font color="yellow">it's nice to see that
their family accepted them.</font>

617
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:56,974
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's wrong?</font>

618
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:03,823
<font color="yellow">I remember when
your brother got married.</font>

619
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:09,235
<font color="yellow">I think about his dead wife who died
while giving birth to Yoo-sung, too.</font>

620
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:19,079
<font color="yellow">Your sister-in-law was a very pretty
and sweet person.</font>

621
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,697
<font color="yellow">You remember her, don't you?</font>

622
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:24,462
<font color="yellow">If she hadn't died while
giving birth to Yoo-sung,</font>

623
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,204
<font color="yellow">he would have had a mom, too.</font>

624
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:32,267
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung...</font>

625
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:34,814
<font color="yellow">My poor Yoo-sung...</font>

626
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:40,587
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

627
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:44,243
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung has you and me.</font>

628
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:48,461
<font color="yellow">I'll be like a dad and a mom to him.</font>

629
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,914
<font color="yellow">So don't worry, okay?</font>

630
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:52,579
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

631
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:58,914
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live
taking care of us forever?</font>

632
00:43:59,852 --> 00:44:01,519
<font color="yellow">When you meet a good man,</font>

633
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:04,137
<font color="yellow">you need to get married.</font>

634
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:11,515
<font color="yellow">I will never marry a man who doesn't think
of you and Yoo-sung as part of his family.</font>

635
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,619
<font color="yellow">I'd rather be single forever.</font>

636
00:44:14,743 --> 00:44:16,008
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

637
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:20,140
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say something
like that again.</font>

638
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:25,798
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung has me,
so don't worry about it.</font>

639
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:34,777
<font color="yellow">When you meet a good man and
get married, I'm going to be so thrilled.</font>

640
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:28,399
<font color="yellow">Don't think about it for too long.</font>

641
00:45:47,683 --> 00:45:48,829
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

642
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:51,213
<font color="yellow">I'm going to exercise.</font>

643
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:52,238
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

644
00:46:28,097 --> 00:46:29,364
<font color="yellow">Did Yoo-sung leave?</font>

645
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,960
<font color="yellow">Yes, he was so happy
to go with his teachers and</font>

646
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:34,293
<font color="yellow">friends that he didn't
even look back at me.</font>

647
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,724
<font color="yellow">The weather is so nice today,
so they'll have a fun time.</font>

648
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:43,242
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I'm going to get ready and
go to work, so stay home and relax.</font>

649
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,901
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! What's this?</font>

650
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:54,261
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

651
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,715
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

652
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,049
<font color="yellow">The money for my logo competition
must have been deposited! Look at this!</font>

653
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,151
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my!
- (You have received $8,321.40 in your account.)</font>

654
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,605
<font color="yellow">How much is this? $8,321.40?</font>

655
00:47:10,683 --> 00:47:12,699
<font color="yellow">But wasn't the prize money $10,000?</font>

656
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:15,940
<font color="yellow">Why was only this much deposited?</font>

657
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:17,612
<font color="yellow">Is it a mistake?</font>

658
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:20,556
<font color="yellow">Was this deposited
after tax was deducted from it?</font>

659
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:22,432
<font color="yellow">Tax?</font>

660
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,815
<font color="yellow">They take tax from prize money?</font>

661
00:47:25,394 --> 00:47:27,534
<font color="yellow">Why did they take so much?</font>

662
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:32,432
<font color="yellow">That's too much! They shouldn't have
said the prize money was $10,000 then.</font>

663
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,602
<font color="yellow">Mom, this is still a lot though.</font>

664
00:47:36,026 --> 00:47:37,026
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

665
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:42,198
<font color="yellow">Even if they take the tax, we should be
grateful they're still giving you the money.</font>

666
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,487
<font color="yellow">This is so great.</font>

667
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,612
<font color="yellow">I was wondering when this
money would come in.</font>

668
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,713
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong, about this money...</font>

669
00:47:55,644 --> 00:47:58,576
<font color="yellow">You want to give this
to the owner, right?</font>

670
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:03,472
<font color="yellow">Yes. We lived without giving them
any money all this time.</font>

671
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:08,257
<font color="yellow">We're getting our security deposit
next month, but I still feel too bad.</font>

672
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:10,815
<font color="yellow">You and I had the same thought
at the same time.</font>

673
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:12,511
<font color="yellow">Let's do that.</font>

674
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,261
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

675
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:18,385
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong, here.</font>

676
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,664
<font color="yellow">Give it to her with this money.</font>

677
00:48:25,073 --> 00:48:26,273
<font color="yellow">What kind of money is this?</font>

678
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:30,656
<font color="yellow">It's the money you made from your part-time jobs
and the money I made from working.</font>

679
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:34,216
<font color="yellow">If we add these up with your prize money,
it'll be about $10,000.</font>

680
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:42,288
<font color="yellow">But Mi-poong, I think it would be best
for you to give the money to Jang-go.</font>

681
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,760
<font color="yellow">His mother doesn't like seeing us.</font>

682
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:47,041
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll do that.</font>

683
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:52,424
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I feel so much lighter knowing
we can at least give that much to her.</font>

684
00:48:52,956 --> 00:48:54,711
<font color="yellow">I was on pins and needles until now.</font>

685
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

686
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:16,784
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mi-poong.</font>

687
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:20,659
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, tell me your account number.</font>

688
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:23,737
<font color="yellow">My bank account number? Why?</font>

689
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:30,628
<font color="yellow">It's not much, but I want to send you
a part of the security deposit.</font>

690
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:33,987
<font color="yellow">Security deposit?</font>

691
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:43,125
<font color="yellow">You really came.</font>

692
00:49:43,245 --> 00:49:45,331
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you telling me
your account number?</font>

693
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,667
<font color="yellow">Why did you make me
come all the way here?</font>

694
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,690
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

695
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:52,206
<font color="yellow">It's $10,000.</font>

696
00:49:52,987 --> 00:49:53,987
<font color="yellow">$10,000?</font>

697
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,297
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I said it's okay.</font>

698
00:49:59,214 --> 00:50:00,502
<font color="yellow">Sit down for a moment.</font>

699
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:08,495
<font color="yellow">Where did you get $10,000?</font>

700
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,206
<font color="yellow">I got the prize money
for the logo competition.</font>

701
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:15,649
<font color="yellow">Also, my mom and I combined
the money we made so far.</font>

702
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,400
<font color="yellow">Then save up this money.</font>

703
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:24,799
<font color="yellow">It made both my mom and me uncomfortable
to live without paying the security deposit.</font>

704
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:29,956
<font color="yellow">Of course, it's not much,
but please accept it.</font>

705
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:33,026
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong,</font>

706
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,707
<font color="yellow">do you think I would feel uncomfortable
accepting this money from you?</font>

707
00:50:39,627 --> 00:50:42,675

give it to me then-</font>

<font color="yellow">Fine. I will.</font>

710
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:55,619
<font color="yellow">Then I'll give this money to my mom.</font>

711
00:50:56,886 --> 00:50:57,886

00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:26,046
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

746
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,673
<font color="yellow">I was about to have my bag
snatched in front of the house.</font>

747
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:30,956
<font color="yellow">What? Snatched?</font>

748
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:31,981
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

749
00:54:32,308 --> 00:54:35,542
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for this young lady,
I don't know what would have happened.</font>

750
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:38,565
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. She saved you?</font>

751
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,008
<font color="yellow">Oh, I didn't save her.
All I did was scream.</font>

752
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,996
<font color="yellow">I came over and hit him with my bag,
so he just ran away.</font>

753
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:47,367
<font color="yellow">Goodness! How grateful!</font>

754
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:49,436
<font color="yellow">- Come in.
- Yes.</font>

755
00:54:49,461 --> 00:54:52,723
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I was on my way somewhere.</font>

756
00:54:53,649 --> 00:54:56,209
<font color="yellow">You saved my daughter,
so how can we just let you go?</font>

757
00:54:56,234 --> 00:54:57,234
<font color="yellow">Come in!</font>

758
00:54:57,259 --> 00:55:00,261
<font color="yellow">Yes! I have to pay you
for saving me. I'm so grateful.</font>

759
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:02,211
<font color="yellow">Give me your phone number.</font>

760
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:06,130
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. It's okay.
I just did the right thing.</font>

761
00:55:07,032 --> 00:55:08,875
<font color="yellow">It seemed like you were very shocked.</font>

762
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:10,383
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

763
00:55:10,688 --> 00:55:11,688
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

764
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:14,129
<font color="yellow">- Good-bye.
- Bye.</font>

765
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:17,070
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

766
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:21,054
<font color="yellow">How can there be such
a brave young lady?</font>

767
00:55:21,594 --> 00:55:22,594
<font color="yellow">She's pretty, too.</font>

768
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:25,335
<font color="yellow">Oh, the grocery! Maid!</font>

769
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:27,547
<font color="yellow">Oh, mom.</font>

770
00:55:36,977 --> 00:55:40,805
<font color="yellow">Seeing that Hee-dong didn't
come out, I don't think he's home.</font>

771
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,025
<font color="yellow">What the heck is going on?</font>

772
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:50,937
<font color="yellow">They'll never forget my face, right?</font>

773
00:55:56,196 --> 00:55:58,828
<font color="yellow">I had a good view of my future house.</font>

774
00:56:01,344 --> 00:56:02,344
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

775
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:12,375
<font color="yellow">What kind of money is this?</font>

776
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,052
<font color="yellow">Is it the money you got
from winning the trial?</font>

777
00:56:17,157 --> 00:56:18,157
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

778
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,487
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong gave you that to pay
partly for the security deposit.</font>

779
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:25,458
<font color="yellow">They must have felt bad
for not paying anything.</font>

780
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,867
<font color="yellow">What kind of calculation is this?</font>

781
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:33,604
<font color="yellow">They should calculate properly. How can
that back house be worth only $10,000?</font>

782
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,231
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

783
00:56:35,665 --> 00:56:37,407
<font color="yellow">Mom, that's not it.</font>

784
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,988
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong's mother felt bad, so she wanted
to give this to you to pay partly for it.</font>

785
00:56:43,294 --> 00:56:46,449
<font color="yellow">She'll give you the rest once
her security deposit is returned to her-</font>

786
00:56:46,474 --> 00:56:50,598
<font color="yellow">She boasted about leaving the house
once she gets that money back.</font>

787
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,326
<font color="yellow">How dare she try
to continue living here?</font>

788
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,687
<font color="yellow">Mom! Where are you going?</font>

789
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:08,087
<font color="yellow">Where is your mom?</font>

790
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:09,622
<font color="yellow">Tell her to come out.</font>

791
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:13,539
<font color="yellow">She went to work, so she's not here.</font>

792
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,293
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you something.</font>

793
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:23,114
<font color="yellow">Did you give this money to
Jang-go to pay for this house?</font>

794
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,988
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

795
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:30,371
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

796
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,239
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

797
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,900
<font color="yellow">You and your mom both
don't have any conscience.</font>

798
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:40,332
<font color="yellow">How can you think of staying here
by just paying merely $10,000?</font>

799
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,488
<font color="yellow">And you should have given this
to me personally.</font>

800
00:57:43,879 --> 00:57:46,412
<font color="yellow">What is your ulterior motive for
giving this money to my son?</font>

801
00:57:47,403 --> 00:57:48,403
<font color="yellow">Ulterior motive?</font>

802
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,598
<font color="yellow">There's nothing like that. I just-</font>

803
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:55,280
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it. When your mom
comes back, make sure you tell her.</font>

804
00:57:57,622 --> 00:57:59,441
<font color="yellow">This is far from enough.</font>

805
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:04,501
<font color="yellow">And tell her not to
even dream of living here.</font>

806
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:09,913
<font color="yellow">Make sure you tell her to move out of
this house once you get your money back.</font>

807
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,342
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

808
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:16,695
<font color="yellow">Did I hit you?</font>

809
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:18,446
<font color="yellow">Did I pinch you?</font>

810
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:21,356
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying when
I haven't done anything to you?</font>

811
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,863
<font color="yellow">No, I'm sorry.</font>

812
00:58:26,325 --> 00:58:27,325
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

813
00:58:29,044 --> 00:58:30,867
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to Mi-poong?</font>

814
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:33,902
<font color="yellow">I already told you
what this money means!</font>

815
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:36,082
<font color="yellow">- Come out.
- What's wrong with you?</font>

816
00:58:36,325 --> 00:58:38,058
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- What did I do?</font>

817
00:58:38,176 --> 00:58:40,274
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go of me!</font>

818
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:42,955
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

819
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:52,895
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

820
00:58:53,215 --> 00:58:56,148
<font color="yellow">Lee Jang-go, what are you doing?
Let go of my arm!</font>

821
00:58:57,692 --> 00:58:58,692
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

822
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:00,723
<font color="yellow">Aren't you being too harsh?</font>

823
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:05,444
<font color="yellow">How am I being harsh?
They're the ones being too harsh!</font>

824
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:07,676
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

825
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,572
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember how we used to live?</font>

826
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:13,087
<font color="yellow">How did we live
after dad's business failed?</font>

827
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:16,223
<font color="yellow">I was young back then,
but I remember everything.</font>

828
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:20,185
<font color="yellow">We worked a day to live a day, and
we worked the week to pay the rent!</font>

829
00:59:20,754 --> 00:59:23,173
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing up the past?</font>

830
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:27,320
<font color="yellow">You should know better
than anyone how hard Mi-poong</font>

831
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:30,776
<font color="yellow">and her mother worked to
come up with that $10,000!</font>

832
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:34,337
<font color="yellow">But how can you say
such hurtful words to Mi-poong?</font>

833
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:38,619
<font color="yellow">Her mother was the one
who first broke her promise!</font>

834
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:42,721
<font color="yellow">She was so prideful as she boasted
about leaving this house!</font>

835
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:46,072
<font color="yellow">And now she's slyly trying to stay here!</font>

836
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:47,822
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

837
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:50,416
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong's mother said
she would look for another house</font>

838
00:59:50,441 --> 00:59:52,571
<font color="yellow">once they get
their security deposit back.</font>

839
00:59:53,915 --> 00:59:56,765
<font color="yellow">But they're not sure when
they'll get their money back,</font>

840
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:59,639
<font color="yellow">so they were trying to pay
a part of it because they felt bad!</font>

841
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:02,298
<font color="yellow">Was that something
they should be criticized about?</font>

842
01:00:02,323 --> 01:00:06,619
<font color="yellow">Hey. It seems like you were
too harsh this time, Geum-sil.</font>

843
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,210
<font color="yellow">Just accept it with a good heart.</font>

844
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:16,314
<font color="yellow">You're already stretching
the rule for them anyways.</font>

845
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:38,642
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong.</font>

846
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:57,431
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong!</font>

847
01:00:59,963 --> 01:01:00,963
<font color="yellow">Kim Mi-poong!</font>

848
01:01:06,971 --> 01:01:08,104
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

849
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,525
<font color="yellow">(Jang-go)</font>

850
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:53,665
<font color="yellow">So this is where that
North Korean family lives?</font>

851
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:54,869
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

852
01:01:57,924 --> 01:02:00,001
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to them? Aren't they scary?</font>

853
01:02:00,307 --> 01:02:02,358
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't even seen them yet.</font>

854
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,737
<font color="yellow">I guess you haven't seen them yet
because there's another gate here.</font>

855
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:11,338
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

856
01:02:11,363 --> 01:02:12,363
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- Yeah.</font>

857
01:02:12,627 --> 01:02:16,526
<font color="yellow">Once the family moves out,
we'll re-do the wallpapers and</font>

858
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:20,511
<font color="yellow">fix everything. It'll be a really
cozy place for us to live, right?</font>

859
01:02:20,713 --> 01:02:21,780
<font color="yellow">I love the idea!</font>

860
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:26,082
<font color="yellow">- It's nice!
- It's nice, huh?</font>

861
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,866
<font color="yellow">How are you doing?</font>

862
01:02:35,822 --> 01:02:40,821
<font color="yellow">I came here again because I missed you.</font>

863
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:44,097
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

864
01:02:46,744 --> 01:02:50,845
<font color="yellow">What are you pulling out
from the garden?</font>

865
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,650
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

866
01:02:56,399 --> 01:03:02,065
<font color="yellow">are you looking towards the southern sky
while you're thinking of me?</font>

<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

868
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:21,587
<font color="yellow">How are you doing?</font>

869
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:29,869
<font color="yellow">Mom, Yoo-sung, and I are doing well.</font>

870
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,353
<font color="yellow">Father,</font>

871
01:03:38,713 --> 01:03:40,446
<font color="yellow">you're watching me now, right?</font>

872
01:03:43,846 --> 01:03:48,025
<font color="yellow">I miss you so much.</font>

873
01:03:51,947 --> 01:03:54,822
<font color="yellow">Where are you and Yeong-cheol right now?</font>

874
01:03:56,892 --> 01:03:59,825
<font color="yellow">Are you two still lying down
in Amnok River?</font>

875
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:08,478
<font color="yellow">Even if you're tired, don't go
anywhere else and just stay there.</font>

876
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:11,182
<font color="yellow">That way...</font>

877
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:15,691
<font color="yellow">I'll be able to go find you later.</font>

878
01:04:20,275 --> 01:04:22,165
<font color="yellow">It'll get cold soon.</font>

879
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:28,736
<font color="yellow">I need to put a blanket over you.</font>

880
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,900
