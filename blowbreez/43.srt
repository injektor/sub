<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

11
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,288
<font color="yellow">I fart often, too.</font>

12
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:58,006

<font color="yellow">Oh, this ring...</font>

16
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:18,079
<font color="yellow">This looks the same as my mother's ring!</font>

17
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,318
<font color="yellow">What? Kim Soon-ok?</font>

18
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:24,545
<font color="yellow">This is me.</font>

19
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,264
<font color="yellow">Oh, Shin-ae! Take a look at this!</font>

20
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:31,891
<font color="yellow">Someone is looking for
Kim Dae-hoon from Pyeongyang!</font>

21
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:34,295
<font color="yellow">A photo of my mother's ring is on this, too!</font>

22
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:37,834
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

23
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,319
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

24
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,532
<font color="yellow">Dad, where did you get this from?</font>

25
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,896
<font color="yellow">This is the paper Yoo-sung
used to make the card.</font>

26
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,276
<font color="yellow">But look.</font>

27
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,224
<font color="yellow">The Kim Dae-hoon from
Pyeongyang is me, isn't it?</font>

28
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:58,989
<font color="yellow">But who is looking for me?</font>

29
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:00,223
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

30
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:07,128
<font color="yellow">Dad, this isn't looking for you.</font>

31
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:10,743
<font color="yellow">There are so many people named
Kim Dae-hoon in this world.</font>

32
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,831
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

33
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:17,145
<font color="yellow">don't you have to find that dumpling diner?</font>

34
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,938
<font color="yellow">You said you had to pay them back.
Let's go find that dumpling diner right now.</font>

35
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,073
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

36
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:28,847
<font color="yellow">But I have to play slap-match
with Yoo-jin right now.</font>

37
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:32,187
<font color="yellow">You'll get punished if you stole a
dumpling and don't pay them back.</font>

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,996
<font color="yellow">Then when Yoo-jin comes
out of the bathroom, tell her</font>

39
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:38,842
<font color="yellow">I'm giving these cards
to her as a present. Okay?</font>

40
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,976
<font color="yellow">Okay, dad. Go downstairs and
get your jacket. I'll be down soon.</font>

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

42
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:53,270
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.
What are all of these?</font>

43
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:58,183
<font color="yellow">These were floating around our house, and
we didn't even know it! What can we do?</font>

44
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,301
<font color="yellow">Mi-poong made these, didn't she?</font>

45
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,175
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mi-poong made these.</font>

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,808
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. What do we do?</font>

47
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:14,262
<font color="yellow">I saw that he had a whole box
of these! If Mr. Kim sees this, we're...</font>

48
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:17,285
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about it...
Oh my god. What do we do?</font>

49
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:23,946
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll do whatever
it takes to take dad out of here,</font>

50
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:28,435
<font color="yellow">so find all the cards in
the house and burn them all!</font>

51
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:31,972
<font color="yellow">Then obtain similar papers
and fold them into cards.</font>

52
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:33,854
<font color="yellow">You understand, don't you?</font>

53
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:39,005
<font color="yellow">Yes. I understand. Oh my goodness.</font>

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,107
<font color="yellow">What about Mr. Kim?</font>

55
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:51,957
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, mommy has to go somewhere
with Mr. Kim, so we'll be going out.</font>

56
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:54,360
<font color="yellow">So go and do your homework, okay?</font>

57
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,301
<font color="yellow">Okay...</font>

58
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:57,777
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

59
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,366
<font color="yellow">Did you call yourself "mommy" to Yoo-jin?</font>

60
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:13,871
<font color="yellow">I did?</font>

61
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,105
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

62
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:20,333
<font color="yellow">When did I do that? You probably misheard.</font>

63
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,263
<font color="yellow">And whether I called myself her aunt or
her mom, why is that important right now?</font>

64
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:32,703
<font color="yellow">I thought for sure she called herself mommy...</font>

65
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,363
<font color="yellow">She's right. That's not important right now.</font>

66
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,730
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae.</font>

67
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:09,762
<font color="yellow">Yes, dad?</font>

68
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,182
<font color="yellow">About that paper that is
searching for Kim Dae-hoon...</font>

69
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:18,629
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we call the phone number on there?</font>

70
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:24,329
<font color="yellow">Let's find out who's looking for me.</font>

71
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:28,640
<font color="yellow">You have grandfather and me.
Who would be looking for you?</font>

72
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:32,735
<font color="yellow">This won't do, Shin-ae. Let's go back home.</font>

73
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,578
<font color="yellow">I need to look at that paper again.</font>

74
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,742
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to find that dumpling diner?</font>

75
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:38,422
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

76
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:43,922
<font color="yellow">Then forget about that paper and check
if this is the right neighborhood or not.</font>

77
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,244
<font color="yellow">This isn't the right neighborhood.</font>

78
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:51,480
<font color="yellow">There weren't any big buildings like these.</font>

79
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,619
<font color="yellow">- But Shin-ae...
- What now?</font>

80
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:57,590
<font color="yellow">I really do think that paper is looking for me!</font>

81
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,340
<font color="yellow">Get out of the car! Go to those
people who are looking for you!</font>

82
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,702
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting angry?</font>

83
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,039
<font color="yellow">You're scaring me...</font>

84
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:17,052
<font color="yellow">Why don't you listen to me? I told you it's not</font>

85
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,675
<font color="yellow">true! Why don't you listen to whatever I say?</font>

86
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:25,220
<font color="yellow">I'm using my precious time to
help you find that dumpling diner.</font>

87
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,045
<font color="yellow">You don't even know how I feel.</font>

88
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,558
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset!</font>

89
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:32,571
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

90
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,439
<font color="yellow">Let's go find that dumpling diner.</font>

91
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,290
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

92
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:02,328
<font color="yellow">I don't think he took it with him.</font>

93
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,160
<font color="yellow">It's right here.</font>

94
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:14,848
<font color="yellow">It's hot!</font>

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,452
<font color="yellow">Where am I supposed to
find similar fliers like this one?</font>

96
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,926
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he made a ton of these.</font>

97
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,132
<font color="yellow">Ms. Ma, what are you doing?</font>

98
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,960
<font color="yellow">Are you burning Mr. Kim's cards right now?</font>

99
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,723
<font color="yellow">No. These are other papers.</font>

100
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,957
<font color="yellow">Go inside! Don't come over here!</font>

101
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:42,340
<font color="yellow">I heard you'll pee at night
if you play with fire.</font>

102
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,307
<font color="yellow">My Yanbian mom told me that.</font>

103
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,603
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go inside!</font>

104
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:51,038
<font color="yellow">And don't come down from the
second floor! You get in the way!</font>

105
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:52,553
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

106
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,436
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

107
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:03,987
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Why did Hee-dong have to
bring her home? She's always in the way!</font>

108
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,157
<font color="yellow">What does she mean by "Yanbian mom?"</font>

109
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,847
<font color="yellow">Does that mean she has another mom?</font>

110
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,671
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

111
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,365
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and try to find Mi-poong's
dumpling diner all you want.</font>

112
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:33,503
<font color="yellow">It's one hour away from here.</font>

113
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:39,451
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, dad? It's not this place either?</font>

114
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:45,532
<font color="yellow">There's another dumpling diner in
the alley over there, so try finding it.</font>

115
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,088
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

116
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:02,543
<font color="yellow">Dad, it's over there.</font>

117
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,158
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae-</font>

118
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:24,887
<font color="yellow">Where did Shin-ae go?</font>

119
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:32,500
<font color="yellow">My phone! It was in my pocket!</font>

120
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:33,971
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

121
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,572
<font color="yellow">Sir, please help me find my daughter.</font>

122
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,252
<font color="yellow">My daughter is gone!</font>

123
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:44,275
<font color="yellow">- Her name is Park Shin-ae!
Please help me find her!
- Let go of me! You're crazy!</font>

124
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,198
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

125
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,597
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

126
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:57,847
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae! Shin-ae!</font>

127
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,467
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae! Shin-ae!</font>

128
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,554
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

129
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:06,959
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

130
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,889
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, something terrible has happened!</font>

131
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,431
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean Dae-hoon is missing?</font>

132
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:34,376
<font color="yellow">Dad kept insisting we go find the
dumpling diner, so we came out,</font>

133
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:39,659
<font color="yellow">but he ran off like he was out of his mind.</font>

134
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,509
<font color="yellow">Ran off like he was out of his mind?
What do you mean by that?</font>

135
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:53,717
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Poor me.
I'm folding cards at this age.</font>

136
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:57,295
<font color="yellow">Is this the right way to do this?</font>

137
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,538
<font color="yellow">This must be right.</font>

138
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,334
<font color="yellow">It works now.</font>

139
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:11,256
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's me.</font>

140
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,405
<font color="yellow">What happened to the cards?</font>

141
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:16,182
<font color="yellow">I saw similar fliers in
the newspaper, so I bought</font>

142
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,345
<font color="yellow">a ton of them, and I'm folding them right now.</font>

143
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:20,431
<font color="yellow">I'm almost done.</font>

144
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:26,196
<font color="yellow">Then put them in that box and put it back
in grandfather's room. I'll be home soon.</font>

145
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,266
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

146
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:34,082
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. When will I fold all of these? Oh, no.</font>

147
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:36,865
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

148
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:38,450
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

149
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,735
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

150
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,819
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae!</font>

151
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:54,243
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae...</font>

152
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:58,446
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

153
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,914
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae! Oh, Shin-ae!</font>

154
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,533
<font color="yellow">Where were you? I've been
looking for you for a long time!</font>

155
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:09,771
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep making trouble?</font>

156
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,368
<font color="yellow">I thought you were following me.</font>

157
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,750
<font color="yellow">I was following you,
but you went off on your own!</font>

158
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,110
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't!</font>

159
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:22,901
<font color="yellow">I was looking for the dumpling diner,
but you suddenly disappeared.</font>

160
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:26,241
<font color="yellow">Dad, what's wrong with you?
Why do you keep saying strange things?</font>

161
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:29,467
<font color="yellow">Why would I disappear?
You were running off on your own,</font>

162
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:32,077
<font color="yellow">so I was trying to go after you,
but I ended up losing you!</font>

163
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,849
<font color="yellow">I really did that?</font>

164
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,777
<font color="yellow">I really ran off?</font>

165
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:43,467
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

166
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:47,738
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

167
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,191
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Shin-ae.</font>

168
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,431
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi's face will get worn out
since you keep staring at her.</font>

169
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,222
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. She's so beautiful,
so I couldn't help it.</font>

170
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,943
<font color="yellow">Is my daughter that beautiful?</font>

171
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:36,569
<font color="yellow">Well, Nam-yi is beautiful
because she takes after me.</font>

172
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,363
<font color="yellow">When I was young,</font>

173
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,933
<font color="yellow">I was much more beautiful than her.</font>

174
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,084
<font color="yellow">I made so many boys cry.</font>

175
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:47,858
<font color="yellow">When I think of them, I feel guilty.</font>

176
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:53,498
<font color="yellow">What are you guys doing acting like a family?</font>

177
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,920
<font color="yellow">This is a workplace!</font>

178
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:59,372
<font color="yellow">Kim Won-bin, there is an elder present.
What do you think you're doing?</font>

179
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:02,061
<font color="yellow">You must keep the promise you made with me.</font>

180
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,452
<font color="yellow">The promise to love only one woman.</font>

181
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,709
<font color="yellow">Go wait at the bakery.</font>

182
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:09,438
<font color="yellow">You and I need to have a serious talk.</font>

183
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,264
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Mr. Kim.</font>

184
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:18,681
<font color="yellow">I need to speak with Won-bin, so can you
and Nam-yi give us a moment?</font>

185
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,545
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you going to say to him?</font>

186
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,885
<font color="yellow">Nam-yi, go and drink coffee with Mr. Kim.</font>

187
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:27,897
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's go, Nam-yi.</font>

188
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:38,732
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, have a seat here.</font>

189
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:39,983
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am.</font>

190
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:46,688
<font color="yellow">Won-bin, do you hate Nam-yi?</font>

191
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:51,139
<font color="yellow">No, I really like her as a friend.</font>

192
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,242
<font color="yellow">However, I don't want her
to take my mom's spot.</font>

193
00:14:56,014 --> 00:15:01,904
<font color="yellow">So you want Nam-yi and your father to break up?</font>

194
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

195
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:06,530
<font color="yellow">But Won-bin,</font>

196
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:13,100
<font color="yellow">there's nothing more horrible than
separating two people who love each other.</font>

197
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,982
<font color="yellow">However, breaking a promise is horrible, too.</font>

198
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,416
<font color="yellow">Father promised that he would only love my mom.</font>

199
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:24,201
<font color="yellow">But isn't dating another
woman breaking his promise?</font>

200
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:28,889
<font color="yellow">You're right. Breaking a promise
is a horrible thing to do.</font>

201
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:33,679
<font color="yellow">However, if your father
has to only live with you forever</font>

202
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:37,915
<font color="yellow">just to keep his promise to his late wife,</font>

203
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:41,336
<font color="yellow">don't you think he'll be too lonely?</font>

204
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,171
<font color="yellow">My father won't be lonely.</font>

205
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:45,577
<font color="yellow">He has me and grandmother.</font>

206
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:50,579
<font color="yellow">So if you meet a good woman in the future,</font>

207
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:54,136
<font color="yellow">you won't be able to marry her
and you'll just have to live with</font>

208
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,398
<font color="yellow">your father forever, all because of
the promise you made with your father?</font>

209
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,484
<font color="yellow">That can't happen.</font>

210
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:02,333
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get married early.</font>

211
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:07,102
<font color="yellow">So you'll get married, but your father
will live the rest of his life alone?</font>

212
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,656
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

213
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:15,352
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to keep the
promise you made to your father either.</font>

214
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,493
<font color="yellow">I found enlightenment toady.</font>

215
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,399
<font color="yellow">I was thoughtless.</font>

216
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:30,750
<font color="yellow">Yes. You're so smart. You understand
everything after just one explanation.</font>

217
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,242
<font color="yellow">- Eat these dumplings.
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

218
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,266
<font color="yellow">Are you coming home now?</font>

219
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,594
<font color="yellow">Did Dae-hoon come home?</font>

220
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:51,609
<font color="yellow">He didn't come home yet. What's wrong, Mr. Kim?</font>

221
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,531
<font color="yellow">Dae-hoon got lost again!</font>

222
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:57,297
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear!</font>

223
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:59,813
<font color="yellow">- Dae-hoon!
- Father!</font>

224
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,378
<font color="yellow">- Father!
- Dae-hoon!</font>

225
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:08,661
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried I was when
I heard you that you went missing?</font>

226
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:12,203
<font color="yellow">Why did you run off on your own
like you had lost your mind?</font>

227
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:17,570
<font color="yellow">If you had gone to find the dumpling diner,
you should have stuck close to Shin-ae.</font>

228
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,938
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, father.</font>

229
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,032
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

230
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:24,406
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

231
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,232
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about a paper
that was looking for me...</font>

232
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,647
<font color="yellow">A paper looking for you?</font>

233
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,011
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

234
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:38,739
<font color="yellow">Father, on a piece of paper
that had been folded into a card,</font>

235
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:41,900
<font color="yellow">it was written, "We are looking for
Kim Dae-hoon from Pyeongyang."</font>

236
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,609
<font color="yellow">On top of that, mother's ring was on there.</font>

237
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,367
<font color="yellow">So I was thinking about that...</font>

238
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,328
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, what is he talking about?</font>

239
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:57,203
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, dad says strange things.</font>

240
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:58,916
<font color="yellow">You saw that paper, too!</font>

241
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,875
<font color="yellow">No. I'll show you myself.</font>

242
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,844
<font color="yellow">- (Freshwater eel found in Gochang)
- That's odd. This isn't it.</font>

243
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:28,334
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. He must have
thought that after he had seen this.</font>

244
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:32,747
<font color="yellow">This is about freshwater eel though.
It's not about searching for people.</font>

245
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,047
<font color="yellow">That's odd! This isn't it!</font>

246
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:39,226
<font color="yellow">There was something that said,
"We are looking for Kim Dae-hoon!"</font>

247
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,575
<font color="yellow">My mother's ring was on here for sure!</font>

248
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:49,584
<font color="yellow">He must have thought</font>

249
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:54,153
<font color="yellow">this curvy freshwater eel was a ring!</font>

250
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,234
<font color="yellow">And it says " Freshwater eel found in Gochang."</font>

251
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:04,220
<font color="yellow">He must have thought it said,
"We are looking for Kim Dae-hoon."</font>

252
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,074
<font color="yellow">No! No! No!</font>

253
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,880
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

254
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,771
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

255
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,216
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo...</font>

256
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:47,001
<font color="yellow">It's clear that Mr. Heo has
something to do with that box incident.</font>

257
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,136
<font color="yellow">But why would he do that to Mi-poong...?</font>

258
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,349
<font color="yellow">Here you go!</font>

259
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,384
<font color="yellow">I'll hold onto this, so you put the tape on it.</font>

260
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,676
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was here?</font>

261
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:09,911
<font color="yellow">Where there's a will, there's a way.</font>

262
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:13,247
<font color="yellow">You can run, but you'll always
be in the palm of my hand.</font>

263
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:16,090
<font color="yellow">Stop saying ridiculous things.</font>

264
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,920
<font color="yellow">Did you put a tracking device on me?</font>

265
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,412
<font color="yellow">I met your mother on the way here.</font>

266
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,425
<font color="yellow">You should have called me
if you were going to do this.</font>

267
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,003
<font color="yellow">Give me the tape.</font>

268
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,677
<font color="yellow">Look. Right there.</font>

269
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,870
<font color="yellow">Right there.</font>

270
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,031
<font color="yellow">It's amazing.</font>

271
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,886
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

272
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:37,911
<font color="yellow">Should you or should you not have a husband?</font>

273
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:43,444
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I told you that I had to
talk to you. Why didn't you reply?</font>

274
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,521
<font color="yellow">I was busy selling dumplings.</font>

275
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,709
<font color="yellow">What did you need to tell me?</font>

276
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:53,509
<font color="yellow">When you were working in Winner's Group,
did something happen between you and Mr. Heo?</font>

277
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:55,341
<font color="yellow">Mr. Heo?</font>

278
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:59,590
<font color="yellow">I only saw his face. I don't know him.</font>

279
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,458
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

280
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:02,778
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

281
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,559
<font color="yellow">You didn't have conflicts
with him inside and outside of work?</font>

282
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:07,927
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

283
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,707
<font color="yellow">Why would I have conflicts with
such a high-ranking person?</font>

284
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:13,660
<font color="yellow">But what is this about?</font>

285
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:16,544
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

286
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:23,106
<font color="yellow">Are you just saying strange things because
you missed me, but had nothing to say?</font>

287
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:27,497
<font color="yellow">How'd you know? I'm caught red-handed!</font>

288
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,552
<font color="yellow">I need to put up the rest of
these fliers, so you go your way.</font>

289
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,277
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep telling me to go
when I have nowhere else to be?</font>

290
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:38,468
<font color="yellow">And I'm your father's son-in-law,
so I should help look for hm.</font>

291
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,664
<font color="yellow">I saw many people over there.</font>

292
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:43,552
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- There.</font>

293
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:46,918
<font color="yellow">Give me the fliers. I'll hold them.</font>

294
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,973
<font color="yellow">Grandma, are you okay?</font>

295
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,645
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

296
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:05,700

You have a terrible fever.</font>

<font color="yellow">What if we never find your father?</font>

318
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:59,784

eat in this frigid weather.</font>

when your mother is very sick?</font>

328
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:50,871

What if I hadn't been there today?</font>

329
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,478
<font color="yellow">Because I was there,
I was able to carry her,</font>

330
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:55,519
<font color="yellow">quickly bring her home,
and buy her medicine.</font>

331
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:58,581

should be a man at home.</font>

332

<font color="yellow">I'm really grateful to you about today.</font>

333

334
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,050
<font color="yellow">I can't!</font>

335
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,423
<font color="yellow">What if your mother's fever rises
in the middle of the night?</font>

336
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:11,424
<font color="yellow">I'll have to carry her to the emergency room!</font>

337

she finds out you're staying here.</font>

you talking about? What's wrong with you?</font>

were looking for Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

<font color="yellow">You saw my mother's ring.</font>

380
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,643
<font color="yellow">So why did you lie that I saw something wrong?</font>

weird things? Why do you lie?</font>

<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

394
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,047
<font color="yellow">You keep saying weird
things that give grandfather and</font>

395
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,899
<font color="yellow">me a hard time? So how can
we continue to live with you?</font>

396
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:45,653
<font color="yellow">So listen to me carefully.</font>

<font color="yellow">You're not my daughter, right?</font>

401
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,096
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that again?</font>

402
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:01,411
<font color="yellow">If I'm not your daughter, whose daughter am I?</font>

403
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:04,192
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to be locked up
in a mental institution?</font>

404
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:05,833
<font color="yellow">Should I really lock you up?</font>

405

00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:53,011
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, here's your water.</font>

448
00:32:57,629 --> 00:32:58,629
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

449
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:01,628
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim...</font>

450
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:08,925
<font color="yellow">I know you have a lot on your mind right now,</font>

451
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:13,433
<font color="yellow">but I thought I should still tell you this.</font>

452
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:15,785
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

453
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,605
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae's father...</font>

454
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,589
<font color="yellow">bit my arm yesterday.</font>

455
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

456
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:38,949
<font color="yellow">Did Dae-hoon do this?</font>

457
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:53,156
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to tell you this because
I thought you would get upset if I did.</font>

458
00:33:54,004 --> 00:34:00,394
<font color="yellow">However, I had to tell you
when Shin-ae got bitten earlier.</font>

459
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,355
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

460
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:07,926
<font color="yellow">Since I'm home all day long,</font>

461
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:13,228
<font color="yellow">so I spend the most time with him.</font>

462
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:17,526
<font color="yellow">But he must be seeing strange things.</font>

463
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:21,297
<font color="yellow">He keeps saying he saw weird
things and says strange nonsense.</font>

464
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:23,996
<font color="yellow">When I told him that's not true...</font>

465
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,730
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

466
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:35,224
<font color="yellow">He had definitely eaten already, but he keeps
saying he didn't and asks for more food.</font>

467
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,429
<font color="yellow">Even if I told him you
had gone to work, he says</font>

468
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:40,707
<font color="yellow">that isn't true and keeps searching for you.</font>

469
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,289
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

470
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,531
<font color="yellow">Those seem like dementia symptoms.</font>

471
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:45,988
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

472
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:51,986
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, what if dad really has dementia?</font>

473
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:53,637
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

474
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:59,706
<font color="yellow">Memory loss can get better over time...</font>

475
00:35:00,824 --> 00:35:05,132
<font color="yellow">but if he has dementia,
won't he lose all of his memories?</font>

476
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:07,003
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

477
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,003
<font color="yellow">Are you sure Dae-hoon did that?</font>

478
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:12,402
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

479
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:19,979
<font color="yellow">He was trying to run out of the house
yesterday, and when I stopped him, he bit me.</font>

480
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:24,859
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, this won't do.</font>

481
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:29,731
<font color="yellow">Let's admit dad into the hospital.
Let's get him proper treatment.</font>

482
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:33,975
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, the two of us should take
your father to the hospital tomorrow.</font>

483
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:35,910
<font color="yellow">Let's test for dementia right away.</font>

484
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:38,602
<font color="yellow">She can go with me! Shin-ae, go with me!</font>

485
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:41,678
<font color="yellow">No, Shin-ae, go with Hee-dong. He'll help you.</font>

486
00:35:43,535 --> 00:35:44,535
<font color="yellow">Yes, father.</font>

487
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:47,338
<font color="yellow">Let's do that, Hee-dong.</font>

488
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:52,503
<font color="yellow">If I can use the rest of my life
to let Dae-hoon get better,</font>

489
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,059
<font color="yellow">I would die right this instant.</font>

490
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:06,934
<font color="yellow">My poor Dae-hoon. What do
we do about my poor Dae-hoon?</font>

491
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,395
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin!</font>

492
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:22,825
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin!</font>

493
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,309
<font color="yellow">I need to tell you something.</font>

494
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:32,979
<font color="yellow">What is it, Mr. Kim?</font>

495
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,710
<font color="yellow">Come here for a moment.</font>

496
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:49,887
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, when you go to school,
you can see Yoo-sung, right?</font>

497
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:51,661
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

498
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:55,161
<font color="yellow">Bring a card from Yoo-sung.</font>

499
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:56,427
<font color="yellow">A card?</font>

500
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:00,534
<font color="yellow">Yes. I really need Yoo-sung's card.</font>

501
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:04,497
<font color="yellow">And this is a secret.</font>

502
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:08,075
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mr. Kim. I'll make sure to bring it.</font>

503
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:10,473
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Yoo-jin.</font>

504
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:12,831
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin! Yoo-jin!</font>

505
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:15,739
<font color="yellow">Dad. Dad.</font>

506
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:19,560
<font color="yellow">What are the two of you doing here?</font>

507
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:21,607
<font color="yellow">What are you two talking secretly about?</font>

508
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,637
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.</font>

509
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,911
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin, you need to hurry up and go to school.</font>

510
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:34,030
<font color="yellow">See you later, Mr. Kim!</font>

511
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:35,302
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

512
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,614
<font color="yellow">Father, it's time to go to the hospital.</font>

513
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:44,293
<font color="yellow">Okay, Hee-dong! I'm going to go with Hee-dong!</font>

514
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,950
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

515
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:52,950
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim Dae-hoon's image examination...</font>

516
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:57,600
<font color="yellow">- (Blood Test Results)
- and blood test...</font>

517
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,692
<font color="yellow">are both fine.</font>

518
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:01,153
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have dementia.</font>

519
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:02,473
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

520
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:07,453
<font color="yellow">Yes. Dementia is a disease where
the brain cells are slowly destroyed.</font>

521
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:13,284
<font color="yellow">However, Mr. Kim Dae-hoon
has partial memory loss from shock.</font>

522
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:16,784
<font color="yellow">Shin-ae, I'm so glad.</font>

523
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:19,247
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hee-dong...</font>

524
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:22,263
<font color="yellow">However, due to his memory loss, he may be</font>

525
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:25,380
<font color="yellow">unemotionally stable and can act unpredictably.</font>

526
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:29,288
<font color="yellow">So you need to make sure
he doesn't receive stress.</font>

527
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:30,887
<font color="yellow">Yes. We understand, doctor.</font>

528
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,966
<font color="yellow">Father, I'm so glad.</font>

529
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:38,461
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, he said I'm not lying, right?</font>

530
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:42,085
<font color="yellow">Doctor, I'm not lying, right?</font>

531
00:38:42,663 --> 00:38:44,764
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're not lying.</font>

532
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,511
<font color="yellow">Hee-dong, can you take my dad outside?</font>

533
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,756
<font color="yellow">Sure. Father, let's go get something to drink.</font>

534
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:54,296
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

535
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:07,238
<font color="yellow">Doctor, sometimes, my father
gets uncontrollably aggressive.</font>

536
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:11,600
<font color="yellow">Please prescribe a strong sedative
for us to use in emergency situations.</font>

537
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:39,187
<font color="yellow">How nice is it that he's sleeping so calmly?</font>

538
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:43,293
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you went to the hospital today.</font>

539
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:47,350
<font color="yellow">The doctor prescribed it to him.
Who will say anything about it?</font>

540
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:56,999
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr. Heo.</font>

541
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:01,858
<font color="yellow">How about we send
Mr. Lee Jang-go to train abroad?</font>

542
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:03,397
<font color="yellow">Train abroad?</font>

543
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:08,459
<font color="yellow">Yes. There's a program at our company
that sends employees to train abroad.</font>

544
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:12,042
<font color="yellow">How about we send him to
a faraway place, with the exception</font>

545
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:15,279
<font color="yellow">of nearby countries like China
and Japan, like America or Europe?</font>

546
00:40:18,347 --> 00:40:20,551
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even fire him
because of my grandfather.</font>

547
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:25,261
<font color="yellow">Sending him to train abroad
seems like a good idea.</font>

548
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:26,527
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

549
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:30,641
<font color="yellow">But I heard that the deadline to apply
to train abroad has already passed.</font>

550
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,599
<font color="yellow">I can get a spot open in Britain.</font>

551
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:34,847
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

552
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,004
<font color="yellow">Then take care of that immediately.</font>

553
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:40,051
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll do that.</font>

554
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,620
<font color="yellow">Did you apply to go train in Britain?</font>

555
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:57,689
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Train in Britain?</font>

556
00:40:58,254 --> 00:40:59,973
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't apply.</font>

557
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,524
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

558
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:03,122
<font color="yellow">Then that's odd.</font>

559
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:07,084
<font color="yellow">I heard that Mr. Gong was
supposed to go train in Britain this time,</font>

560
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,576
<font color="yellow">but you've been selected to go.</font>

561
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:10,946
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

562
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,666
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're not misinformed?</font>

563
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,534
<font color="yellow">No. The human resources team
made the decision right now.</font>

564
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,578
<font color="yellow">They said you've been
selected to go train in Britain.</font>

565
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:22,003
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

566
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,612
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

567
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:35,224
<font color="yellow">Is Jang-go really going to train in Britain?</font>

568
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:37,174
<font color="yellow">Yes. Are you that happy?</font>

569
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:41,471
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, thank you so much!</font>

570
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:49,375
<font color="yellow">I was so upset because of Jang-go
lately because he didn't get a divorce.</font>

571
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:52,367
<font color="yellow">Your son didn't get
a divorce? Didn't you say</font>

572
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:54,613
<font color="yellow">last time that he went to
the court to get a divorce?</font>

573
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,578
<font color="yellow">You don't even know the half of it.</font>

574
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:58,423
<font color="yellow">He didn't go to court.</font>

575
00:41:58,915 --> 00:41:59,969
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

576
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:03,927
<font color="yellow">But if he goes to train in
Britain this time, he won't be able</font>

577
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:06,868
<font color="yellow">to see her. Out of sight,
out of mind. This is great news!</font>

578
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:11,883
<font color="yellow">That Mi-poong girl must
have held your son back.</font>

579
00:42:12,493 --> 00:42:14,844
<font color="yellow">You must have been so upset!</font>

580
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,461
<font color="yellow">What's the point of talking about it?</font>

581
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:20,440
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I'll make sure
to separate them this time.</font>

582
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,180
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, thank you.</font>

583
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,547
<font color="yellow">But how did Jang-go get such an opportunity?</font>

584
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:35,047
<font color="yellow">My daughter-in-law said there was a spot
available, so I quickly recommended your son.</font>

585
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:41,476
<font color="yellow">Chung-ja, thank you so much!</font>

586
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:48,196
<font color="yellow">What are friends for?
Besides, you and I are in-laws, too.</font>

587
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:50,922
<font color="yellow">Please be good to Hee-ra!</font>

588
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, don't you worry about her! I'm taking
care of her like she's my daughter!</font>

589
00:42:58,727 --> 00:42:59,727
<font color="yellow">Kim Yoo-sung!</font>

590
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,537
<font color="yellow">What is it, Yoo-jin?</font>

591
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:05,430
<font color="yellow">Do you have cards?</font>

592
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:07,859
<font color="yellow">Cards? Yes, I do.</font>

593
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:14,117
<font color="yellow">Then can I have some? Mr. Kim
told me to bring the cards you made.</font>

594
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:18,290
<font color="yellow">Okay, but he must really love cards.</font>

595
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,563
<font color="yellow">Yes, he loves them a lot.</font>

596
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:25,450
<font color="yellow">First, take these. I have more in my backpack.</font>

597
00:43:25,774 --> 00:43:27,317
<font color="yellow">Okay, thanks.</font>

598
00:43:38,774 --> 00:43:40,711
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim!</font>

599
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,759
<font color="yellow">You're home, Yoo-jin?</font>

600
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:48,531
<font color="yellow">Were you taking a nap?</font>

601
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:51,055
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

602
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,000
<font color="yellow">Strangely enough, I feel
sleepy even if I keep sleeping.</font>

603
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:11,902
<font color="yellow">Yoo-sung gave these to me, Mr. Kim.</font>

604
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:21,006
<font color="yellow">Did Yoo-sung really give these to you?</font>

605
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,267
<font color="yellow">Yes, he did.</font>

606
00:44:30,686 --> 00:44:31,686
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

607
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:39,177
<font color="yellow">This isn't it.</font>

608
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:46,975
<font color="yellow">There really was a paper
that was looking for Kim Dae-hoon.</font>

609
00:44:51,506 --> 00:44:53,966
<font color="yellow">My mother's ring was on it, too.</font>

610
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,646
<font color="yellow">This isn't it...</font>

611
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:05,341
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, what's wrong?</font>

612
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:07,920
<font color="yellow">This isn't it.</font>

613
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:13,021
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, are you crying?</font>

614
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:16,373
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin...</font>

615
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:22,170
<font color="yellow">I must really be ill...</font>

616
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,193
<font color="yellow">Don't cry, Mr. Kim.</font>

617
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:33,170
<font color="yellow">You're not crazy at all.</font>

618
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:37,797
<font color="yellow">Yoo-jin...</font>

619
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:52,329
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

620
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,040
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo...</font>

621
00:45:57,743 --> 00:46:00,076
<font color="yellow">Hi, Yoo-jin. Did you have
a good time at school?</font>

622
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:03,118
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

623
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:06,243
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is crying.</font>

624
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:08,102
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law is crying?</font>

625
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:09,353
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

626
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,281
<font color="yellow">He wanted cards from Yoo-sung,
so I brought them to him,</font>

627
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:17,489
<font color="yellow">but after he unfolded them, he started to cry.</font>

628
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,680
<font color="yellow">He said he thinks he might be ill and cried.</font>

629
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,646
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law is a bit sick.</font>

630
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:29,024
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

631
00:46:29,735 --> 00:46:33,849
<font color="yellow">He went through something traumatic
in the past, and after that, he's been ill.</font>

632
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:39,618
<font color="yellow">I'll play with him a lot so
that he won't get lonely.</font>

633
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:41,438
<font color="yellow">You're so kind.</font>

634
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,479
<font color="yellow">Hi, mom.</font>

635
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:48,994
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?
You're bothering my son.</font>

636
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:51,955
<font color="yellow">It's fine. She's not bothering me.</font>

637
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,024
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

638
00:46:59,948 --> 00:47:01,479
<font color="yellow">What do you need to tell me?</font>

639
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:04,041
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep Yoo-jin here?</font>

640
00:47:04,995 --> 00:47:07,821
<font color="yellow">- Why are you suddenly asking me that?
- Suddenly, whatever!</font>

641
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,642
<font color="yellow">Aren't you two going to have a baby?</font>

642
00:47:09,815 --> 00:47:13,520
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you thinking about having a baby?
Why are you only thinking about Yoo-jin?</font>

643
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:15,705
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you being like this to her?</font>

644
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,630
<font color="yellow">Please treat her nicely.</font>

645
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:20,782
<font color="yellow">I'm going to raise Yoo-jin like she's my child.</font>

646
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:23,683
<font color="yellow">Oh, you caused this trouble!</font>

647
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:26,936
<font color="yellow">Anyways, I can let you do that,</font>

648
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:30,525
<font color="yellow">but you can't adopt her. You better
not put her on the family registry!</font>

649
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:32,988
<font color="yellow">Mom, Yoo-jin will hear you.</font>

650
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:38,013
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine! I'll be good to her,
so hurry up and have a baby!</font>

651
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,017
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because I'm worried you two</font>

652
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,777
<font color="yellow">aren't going to have a baby because of Yoo-jin!</font>

653
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:46,220
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't worry.</font>

654
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:48,368
<font color="yellow">We're making a lot of effort right now.</font>

655
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:52,058
<font color="yellow">Look at this. Shin-ae
is waiting for our baby, too.</font>

656
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:55,222
<font color="yellow">Really? She is?</font>

657
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:56,403
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

658
00:47:57,504 --> 00:47:58,504
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

659
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:04,332
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. I wonder what you'll have
to do to quickly have a baby!</font>

660
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:15,817
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

661
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,184
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jo.</font>

662
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:18,364
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

663
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:26,043
<font color="yellow">This is the persimmon punch we'll be
giving out during the winter season. Try it.</font>

664
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:31,152
<font color="yellow">It's not that sweet. It's good.</font>

665
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:32,395
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

666
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:34,003
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

667
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:39,129
<font color="yellow">Is Ms. Joo doing well?</font>

668
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:43,495
<font color="yellow">She opened up a dumpling diner,
and it's starting to settle down now.</font>

669
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,653
<font color="yellow">A dumpling diner?</font>

670
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,291
<font color="yellow">(Father's Dumplings)</font>

671
00:49:17,672 --> 00:49:21,137
<font color="yellow">(Congratulations on opening up your business)</font>

672
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,457
<font color="yellow">- I'm back.
- Hi.</font>

673
00:50:02,027 --> 00:50:03,371
<font color="yellow">Where'd you get that plant from?</font>

674
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:05,433
<font color="yellow">It was in front of the diner.</font>

675
00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:08,629
<font color="yellow">There's a ribbon to congratulate us, too.</font>

676
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,544
<font color="yellow">I wonder who left that there.</font>

677
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:13,726
<font color="yellow">Is it Jang-go, by any chance?</font>

678
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:17,356
<font color="yellow">Mom, would Jang-go have just left it here?</font>

679
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:20,582
<font color="yellow">If it was Jang-go, he would have showed off</font>

680
00:50:20,607 --> 00:50:23,398
<font color="yellow">about it and asked, "Mother, do you like this?"</font>

681
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:26,172
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

682
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:30,812
<font color="yellow">Mom, this plant is small but pretty.</font>

683
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:35,011
<font color="yellow">Since there's a green plant here,
it seems like the diner got a lot brighter.</font>

684
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:37,411
<font color="yellow">I think we'll have a lot of blessings.</font>

685
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:38,547
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

686
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,860
<font color="yellow">I wonder who had left it here.
It would have been nice</font>

687
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:46,166
<font color="yellow">if he or she could have
come in for some dumpling soup.</font>

688
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:28,308
<font color="yellow">Is it someone's birthday today?</font>

689
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:32,228
<font color="yellow">I don't think it is. What day is it today?
Why did you prepare a feast?</font>

690
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:35,855
<font color="yellow">Jang-go is going to go train in Britain.</font>

691
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:37,254
<font color="yellow">- Britain?
- Britain?</font>

692
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:40,279
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Isn't that where Ha-yeon is?</font>

693
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:42,449
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is, Nam-yi.</font>

694
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,308
<font color="yellow">What do you mean Jang-go is going to Britain?</font>

695
00:51:48,918 --> 00:51:52,400
<font color="yellow">His company is going to send him
to train so that he can study more.</font>

696
00:51:52,574 --> 00:51:55,944
<font color="yellow">Hee-ra's mom said she helped him out a lot.</font>

697
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:58,207
<font color="yellow">My mom?</font>

698
00:51:59,957 --> 00:52:01,437
<font color="yellow">- I'm back.
- Hi.</font>

699
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,948
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jang-go, is it true
that you're going to Britain?</font>

700
00:52:07,402 --> 00:52:08,402
<font color="yellow">No, grandma.</font>

701
00:52:09,277 --> 00:52:10,610
<font color="yellow">What do you mean no?</font>

702
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:13,343
<font color="yellow">The company said they were
going to send you to train there.</font>

703
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,296
<font color="yellow">I did get the offer,
but I told them I couldn't go.</font>

704
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,481
<font color="yellow">Did you really?</font>

705
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:20,527
<font color="yellow">There are so many people who want to go there!</font>

706
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:24,496
<font color="yellow">Why? Why can't you go?</font>

707
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:27,168
<font color="yellow">Mom, I have a lot of things to do here.</font>

708
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:30,598
<font color="yellow">What? Things to do? What kind of things?</font>

709
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:33,886
<font color="yellow">What kind of things are you
doing here that won't allow you to go?</font>

710
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:36,216
<font color="yellow">Everyone else is trying so hard to go there!</font>

711
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:38,574
<font color="yellow">Why would you reject such a great offer?</font>

712
00:52:38,996 --> 00:52:41,254
<font color="yellow">Is this because of Mi-poong?</font>

713
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:43,049
<font color="yellow">Stop it, please.</font>

714
00:52:43,863 --> 00:52:46,550
<font color="yellow">If you feel so bad about it, then you can go.</font>

715
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:49,910
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to my room.
- Oh my goodness!</font>

716
00:52:50,262 --> 00:52:54,087
<font color="yellow">Mother. Nam-yi. Am I the wrong one here?</font>

717
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:57,511
<font color="yellow">How could he refuse such a great offer?</font>

718
00:52:58,012 --> 00:53:00,579
<font color="yellow">Jang-go said he has a lot of things to do here.</font>

719
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,536
<font color="yellow">He must have some kind of plan.</font>

720
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,261
<font color="yellow">Oh my god. This is unbelievable.</font>

721
00:53:09,668 --> 00:53:10,668
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

722
00:53:11,465 --> 00:53:15,191
<font color="yellow">Jang-go, sit down for a moment.</font>

723
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:23,637
<font color="yellow">Jang-go,</font>

724
00:53:24,652 --> 00:53:31,933
<font color="yellow">it's great that your company is offering
to send you to train abroad in Britain.</font>

725
00:53:32,496 --> 00:53:35,466
<font color="yellow">Are you refusing to go because of Mi-poong?</font>

726
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:40,793
<font color="yellow">Then how about you two go together?</font>

727
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:44,168
<font color="yellow">The two of you can go live there together.</font>

728
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:46,972
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as moving out of the house.</font>

729
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:52,199
<font color="yellow">Go, study, and work together.</font>

730
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:56,094
<font color="yellow">You can live a happy
newlywed life there with Mi-poong.</font>

731
00:53:57,316 --> 00:54:00,261
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Mi-poong won't go.</font>

732
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,691
<font color="yellow">She's searching for her father right now.
How could she go so far away?</font>

733
00:54:03,716 --> 00:54:05,582
<font color="yellow">Just bring it up.</font>

734
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:11,193
<font color="yellow">She won't find him overnight.
There's no guarantee he's even here either.</font>

735
00:54:12,356 --> 00:54:16,411
<font color="yellow">Ask her about it, okay?</font>

736
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:18,613
<font color="yellow">- Okay, grandma.
- Good.</font>

737
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,636
<font color="yellow">How could he give up such a good opportunity?</font>

738
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,398
<font color="yellow">And all because of that wench, too!</font>

739
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:34,718
<font color="yellow">She's the worst enemy out there!</font>

740
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,109
<font color="yellow">Disgusting.</font>

741
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,570
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

are one in body and soul.</font>

831

to each other because it's natural.</font>
