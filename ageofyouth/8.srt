<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

46
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:02,782
<font color="yellow">Then, maybe he's the "strange man"
that the landlady mentioned?</font>

47
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:03,883
<font color="yellow">Probably.</font>

48
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:07,282
<font color="yellow">So things turned out like that, huh?
Even though you said it wasn't like that.</font>

49
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:08,883
<font color="yellow">And that's still true.</font>

50
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,782
<font color="yellow">Why's he following you around, then?</font>

51
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:18,683
<font color="yellow">At any rate, you never know,
so don't just open the door for anyone.</font>

52
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:24,183
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure have a great eye for men!
What's your secret?</font>

53
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:26,683
<font color="yellow">All you have to do
is be is an easy woman.</font>

54
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:29,683
<font color="yellow">Men love that.</font>

55
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,582
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

56
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:45,683
<font color="yellow">Smile, but not too much. And spare
them a few glances, but not too much.</font>

57
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:48,582
<font color="yellow">And loosen a few buttons,
but not too many.</font>

58
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:52,983
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.
I was doing it all wrong!</font>

59
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:56,282
<font color="yellow">How do I look?
Am I pretty yet?</font>

60
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:57,983
<font color="yellow">Would you like anyone?</font>

61
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:01,483
<font color="yellow">Would you like any man who
says that they like you?</font>

62
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:11,183
<font color="yellow">This is so good.
Now, if you're done eating, get up.</font>

63
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:14,782
<font color="yellow">You said you're not feeling
good today, right? Get up.</font>

64
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:16,582
<font color="yellow">- Let's go and sleep!
- Hey!</font>

65
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,883
<font color="yellow">What the hell is wrong with you?</font>

66
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,383
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

67
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,582
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, say it,
instead of beating around the bush.</font>

68
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:25,983
<font color="yellow">Like what? I have nothing
to talk to you about.</font>

69
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:30,282
<font color="yellow">Oh, do you have something to say to me?</font>

70
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,982
<font color="yellow">That sniveling little...</font>

71
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,783
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're really stuffing yourself.
Guess you're not watching your weight.</font>

72
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:05,582
<font color="yellow">So? You like that?</font>

73
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:08,082
<font color="yellow">Why would I be happy
about you getting fatter?</font>

74
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,783
<font color="yellow">Because you'll look
better in comparison.</font>

75
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:21,082
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm coming out now.</font>

76
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,082
<font color="yellow">Apparently, he was
originally a carpenter.</font>

77
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:02,783
<font color="yellow">He specialized in working on
temples and traditional homes.</font>

78
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,683
<font color="yellow">But he doesn't to do that work
anymore, after he got out of jail.</font>

79
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:06,783
<font color="yellow">Jail?</font>

80
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:09,783
<font color="yellow">He got 10 years in jail for battery
that led to death, and got out in 7.</font>

81
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,482
<font color="yellow">What does "battery that
led to death" mean?</font>

82
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:13,683
<font color="yellow">It means that he beat someone to death.</font>

83
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,982
<font color="yellow">Turn him in to the cops.</font>

84
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,882
<font color="yellow">I'll do it later.</font>

85
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:26,082
<font color="yellow">You can't even work as of late, right?</font>

86
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:31,982
<font color="yellow">What's going on? I need to know,
if I'm going to help you!</font>

87
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:40,183
<font color="yellow">- Hey! Are you okay?
- Are you all right, Miss?</font>

88
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,082
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you know her?</font>

89
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,683
<font color="yellow">Here you are.</font>

90
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:20,882
<font color="yellow">Please have a nice time.</font>

91
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,283
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me.
- Yes?</font>

92
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,882
<font color="yellow">I ordered a medium-rare.</font>

93
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,183
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll go and
check this for you.</font>

94
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,082
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

95
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,683
<font color="yellow">- Chef!
- Yes?</font>

96
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:53,982
<font color="yellow">There was an error
with Table Three's order.</font>

97
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:58,382
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?
They asked for it well-done!</font>

98
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:02,382
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

99
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,183
<font color="yellow">- Hey, broiler!
- Yes, Chef?</font>

100
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,783
<font color="yellow">- Give me two medium-rares! Quick!
- Yes, Chef!</font>

101
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:24,683
<font color="yellow">Yoon Jin Myung!</font>

102
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:31,582
<font color="yellow">What did Table Three complain about?</font>

103
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:33,882
<font color="yellow">Their order was put in wrong.</font>

104
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,982
<font color="yellow">Was it put in wrong,
or did the wrong food come out?</font>

105
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,683
<font color="yellow">- I rectified the situation.
- Oh, did you?</font>

106
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:39,783
<font color="yellow">What about the cost of the
meat that was wasted?</font>

107
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:41,783
<font color="yellow">What about the amount of the time
the customers were left to wait?</font>

108
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:45,183
<font color="yellow">Everyone else can go home.</font>

109
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,683
<font color="yellow">Yoon Jin Myung.</font>

110
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,882
<font color="yellow">You're really not going
to apologize, are you?</font>

111
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,783
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling good about yourself?</font>

112
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:10,582
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about the
damage you've done to our restaurant?</font>

113
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,882
<font color="yellow"><i>[Bus Schedule]</i></font>

114
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,382
<font color="yellow">Get on.</font>

115
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:37,283
<font color="yellow">That was the last bus for the night. If
you're not going to take a cab, get on.</font>

116
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,482
<font color="yellow">Just quit.</font>

117
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,582
<font color="yellow">Quit working at the restaurant.</font>

118
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:34,582
<font color="yellow">You're only a part-timer anyway, and you
can find tons of other jobs like that.</font>

119
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,082
<font color="yellow">You're home?</font>

120
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:06,382
<font color="yellow">Senior!</font>

121
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,882
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's me, your Senior!</font>

122
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:12,483
<font color="yellow">Just what--</font>

123
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,283
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

124
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,882
<font color="yellow">Hey, this guy looks really familiar!</font>

125
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,082
<font color="yellow">I'll go buy some medicine for you.</font>

126
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,283
<font color="yellow">What medicine?</font>

127
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:56,582
<font color="yellow">- A pain reliever?
- Whatever! I don't need it!</font>

128
00:17:57,382 --> 00:18:00,082
<font color="yellow">- What about a band-aid?
- Band-aid, my ass.</font>

129
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,182
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

130
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:09,182
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be totally decimated
if I try to surprise you again.</font>

131
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,783
<font color="yellow">It's because you popped out of nowhere!</font>

132
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,682
<font color="yellow">A surprise is supposed to surprise you!</font>

133
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:16,882
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be one
if I warned you in advance!</font>

134
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:22,882
<font color="yellow">Sit!</font>

135
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:31,783
<font color="yellow">Closer!</font>

136
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:45,783
<font color="yellow">Who's the one who kicked me before?
They need to become a UFC fighter!</font>

137
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:49,182
<font color="yellow">- Does it hurt a lot?
- Only I could've survived that.</font>

138
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:51,682
<font color="yellow">If it had been someone else, they
would've been dead by now!</font>

139
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:03,582
<font color="yellow">Did you drink?
Where did you go to drink?</font>

140
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:05,082
<font color="yellow">In front of Hongdae.</font>

141
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:08,082
<font color="yellow">- With who?
- My friends from high school.</font>

142
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:11,983
<font color="yellow">They all told me to call you
and tell you to come, but I didn't.</font>

143
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,483
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

144
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:18,082
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, why?
Because you're mine.</font>

145
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:22,382
<font color="yellow">Because only I get to look at you.</font>

146
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:39,283
<font color="yellow">This part hurts the most.
The spot where you hit me.</font>

147
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,882
<font color="yellow">It's all red.</font>

148
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:42,582
<font color="yellow">I might even get a brain hemorrhage.</font>

149
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,682
<font color="yellow">Do you know how scary
brain hemorrhages are?</font>

150
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:46,983
<font color="yellow">It'll be bad if it bruises!</font>

151
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,783
<font color="yellow">What? He's doing a hell of
a good job! He deserves it!</font>

152
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:47,983
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn all these
perverted, old-man mannerisms?</font>

153
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:52,382
<font color="yellow">Are you making fun of me?
Apologize, right now!</font>

154
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:56,882
<font color="yellow">Senior Kang is scary.</font>

155
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:00,983
<font color="yellow">Don't go over there.
That'd be best.</font>

156
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,783
<font color="yellow">It's a learning experience!</font>

157
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:55,582
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

158
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:26,882
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

159
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,783
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

160
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:44,182
<font color="yellow">Okay, that's fine.
Where do I need to go?</font>

161
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,983
<font color="yellow">- I told you, yes!
- Really?</font>

162
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,682
<font color="yellow">Wow, you lost so much weight in your
face! Maybe because you were sick?</font>

163
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:52,182
<font color="yellow">Yeah! That's why I'm
planning to eat a lot today!</font>

164
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,983
<font color="yellow">Good. CEO Oh is buying,
so eat as much as you want!</font>

165
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:56,983
<font color="yellow">- Oh, thank you!
- Sure.</font>

166
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,983
<font color="yellow">Why are you buying, Honey?</font>

167
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,783
<font color="yellow">Because I have a great personality.</font>

168
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:03,682
<font color="yellow">Great personality?
Why, I ought to flip this table over!</font>

169
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,382
<font color="yellow">Just eat!</font>

170
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,283
<font color="yellow">Hey, how long does it take to
get to a golf course from here?</font>

171
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:09,082
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you get some
practice in, in the meantime?</font>

172
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:12,082
<font color="yellow">Well, you do have to
pay me back for lunch!</font>

173
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:14,082
<font color="yellow">- See you later, then.
- Yeah.</font>

174
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:26,783
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.
It'll only take a second.</font>

175
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:28,682
<font color="yellow">Talk about what?
I have nothing to talk to you about!</font>

176
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:29,783
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

177
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,783
<font color="yellow">Who are you, Mister?</font>

178
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,082
<font color="yellow">Why are you avoiding me?</font>

179
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:34,682
<font color="yellow">What happened that day?
Tell me, damn it!</font>

180
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,983
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to talk
about with you! Let go!</font>

181
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,082
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

182
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,582
<font color="yellow">I'm that girl's father!
And as her father, I need to know!</font>

183
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:43,582
<font color="yellow">- How my daughter died, and why!
- Hey, Mister.</font>

184
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,082
<font color="yellow">Tell me!
Please, tell me!</font>

185
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,082
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

186
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:02,283
<font color="yellow">- You can't act this way here, sirs!
- Oh, damn it!</font>

187
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:03,783
<font color="yellow">Stop him.</font>

188
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,483
<font color="yellow">Please, tell me!</font>

189
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:09,082
<font color="yellow">What happened that day?
Please, tell me!</font>

190
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:10,783
<font color="yellow">Please! Tell me!</font>

191
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,983
<font color="yellow">How did you end up
meeting a guy like him?</font>

192
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:26,382
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

193
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,882
<font color="yellow">This sucks. My schedule's
all out of whack now.</font>

194
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:06,182
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

195
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,283
<font color="yellow">No, I'll come out.</font>

196
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:11,783
<font color="yellow">I told you, don't come here!</font>

197
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:28,082
<font color="yellow">Hey, you surprised me!</font>

198
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:31,582
<font color="yellow">But you still think I'm cute, right?
You think that I'm lovable, right?</font>

199
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:34,582
<font color="yellow">Geez, I thought my lower back
was going to give out.</font>

200
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:35,582
<font color="yellow">Get in!</font>

201
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:39,682
<font color="yellow">I planned everything, and looked
for good restaurants to eat at.</font>

202
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:41,983
<font color="yellow">First, go toward the
Boamdong Citizen's Center.</font>

203
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:44,483
<font color="yellow">If you head behind that building,
there's a dirt path.</font>

204
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:47,682
<font color="yellow">Apparently, a lot of locals
frequent that area. Won't that be nice?</font>

205
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:50,983
<font color="yellow">Why are you in such a good mood?</font>

206
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,182
<font color="yellow">I'm happy as long as I have you.
Don't you feel the same way?</font>

207
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:11,983
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

208
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:14,783
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

209
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,582
<font color="yellow">Here, Honey.
Say "ah."</font>

210
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:33,582
<font color="yellow">Wait, slow down!</font>

211
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:36,682
<font color="yellow">Wait just a sec.</font>

212
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:40,182
<font color="yellow">Say "ah!"</font>

213
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:05,983
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're back?</font>

214
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:10,882
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

215
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:13,682
<font color="yellow">Oh... Dong Shik.</font>

216
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:15,182
<font color="yellow">What does he want?</font>

217
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:17,882
<font color="yellow">Nothing big. He just wants us
to go have a drink.</font>

218
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:23,182
<font color="yellow">Man, that guy is a total alcoholic.
He drinks about eight times a week!</font>

219
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,182
<font color="yellow">And he has such a low
tolerance for alcohol, too!</font>

220
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:29,682
<font color="yellow">Want another glass?</font>

221
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:35,783
<font color="yellow">- I'm leaving.
- What?</font>

222
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:38,783
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

223
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,582
<font color="yellow">What's with you, all of a sudden?</font>

224
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:46,182
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong?</font>

225
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,783
<font color="yellow">- No.
- What, then?</font>

226
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:57,082
<font color="yellow">I don't feel well.
I think I got indigestion.</font>

227
00:27:57,082 --> 00:27:59,783
<font color="yellow">Then you should've said so!</font>

228
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,682
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling really bad?</font>

229
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,783
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

230
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:07,882
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll take you home.</font>

231
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:10,483
<font color="yellow">I'll take the bus.</font>

232
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:13,382
<font color="yellow">There's a bus that takes
me straight home, so...</font>

233
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:17,582
<font color="yellow">That'd be better for me.</font>

234
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:35,783

<font color="yellow">Please! Tell me!</font>

248
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:59,783
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's me. You told me before that
guy lives at a student hostel, right?</font>

249
00:29:59,783 --> 00:30:01,382
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have any

255
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,983
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

256
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:22,082
<font color="yellow">- Why are you acting like this?
- What?</font>

257
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:23,382
<font color="yellow">Why have you been acting
so weird recently?</font>

258
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:24,582
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

259
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:28,182
<font color="yellow">What did your boyfriend tell you?</font>

260
00:30:28,182 --> 00:30:29,983
<font color="yellow">I don't know what
that bastard said, but--</font>

261
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:31,783
<font color="yellow">Stop calling him a bastard!
How dare you!</font>

262
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:33,582
<font color="yellow">I seriously have nothing to do with him.</font>

263
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,382
<font color="yellow">That bastard just overreacted,
all on his own.</font>

264
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:36,783
<font color="yellow">Get the facts straight before
you go bitching at someone!</font>

265
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:37,983
<font color="yellow">You flirted with him first.</font>

266
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:39,882
<font color="yellow">Did that bastard tell you that?
That I flirted with him first?</font>

267
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,182
<font color="yellow">He doesn't need to
tell me for me to know!</font>

268
00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:42,682
<font color="yellow">You flirt with every damn guy
that passes by!</font>

269
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:43,682
<font color="yellow">Are you freaking kidding me?</font>

270
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:45,582
<font color="yellow">If I'd actually tried to seduce him,
I would've had him by now!</font>

271
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:48,483
<font color="yellow">- Good for you!
- Yeah, I'm better than you.</font>

272
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:50,682
<font color="yellow">- You little--
- Hey! Stop!</font>

273
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,682
<font color="yellow">Please stop!</font>

274
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:53,382
<font color="yellow">Crazy bitch.
You're the same as that bastard!</font>

275
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:54,882
<font color="yellow">That's why you two are dating!</font>

276
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:59,182
<font color="yellow">You crazy bitch! Don't you dare lay
a hand on my Honey! I'll kill you!</font>

277
00:30:59,182 --> 00:31:01,682
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't take him even if you
offered him to me, you ---- bitch!</font>

278
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:06,882
<font color="yellow">- Let go.
- Huh?</font>

279
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:08,882
<font color="yellow">Let go, already!
It hurts!</font>

280
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,783
<font color="yellow">Oh... sorry.</font>

281
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,983
<font color="yellow">They sure are feisty.</font>

282
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:48,382
<font color="yellow">Just get yourself a bowl of rice,
and sit. Let's eat together.</font>

283
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:50,182
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

284
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:54,983
<font color="yellow">How can you eat rice, first thing
in the morning? Eat bread.</font>

285
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:56,682
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how bad
white bread is for you?</font>

286
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,882
<font color="yellow">And it's like a calorie bomb, too.</font>

287
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,082
<font color="yellow">Who cares if you count calories,
when you're always getting so fat?</font>

288
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,382
<font color="yellow">It's because you're not educated
that you know nothing.</font>

289
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:04,382
<font color="yellow">Figures.</font>

290
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:07,182
<font color="yellow">The only news you read is entertainment
news, and you're always shopping.</font>

291
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:08,983
<font color="yellow">I wonder if it actually feels
good to live that way?</font>

292
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:10,882
<font color="yellow">You and your yo-yo diets.</font>

293
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:11,882
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's awesome to
live like this, all right?</font>

294
00:32:11,882 --> 00:32:15,382
<font color="yellow">- I wasn't talking to you!
- And neither was I.</font>

295
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:18,182
<font color="yellow">- So, are you going to eat, or not?
- What are you going to eat?</font>

296
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,682
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Senior?</font>

297
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:23,682
<font color="yellow">- The public sauna.
- I'll come with you!</font>

298
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:25,882
<font color="yellow">I need to exfoliate. I haven't
done it in a while, you see.</font>

299
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:27,382
<font color="yellow">So I keep getting ashy.</font>

300
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:29,682
<font color="yellow">Wait for me! I'll be right out!</font>

301
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:36,382
<font color="yellow">Why are you torturing her like this?</font>

302
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:40,283
<font color="yellow">Sheesh. What's with you two?</font>

303
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:46,800
<font color="yellow">Why does Senior Ye Eun have
to date a guy like that?</font>

304
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,998
<font color="yellow">I mean, she's pretty,
smiles a lot, and is really cute.</font>

305
00:32:51,998 --> 00:32:55,300
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if she could
date a better guy.</font>

306
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,300
<font color="yellow">You don't know the story
about Ye Eun's older sister, right?</font>

307
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,100
<font color="yellow">She has an older sister?</font>

308
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah. She's studying abroad
in Germany right now</font>

309
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,929
<font color="yellow">but apparently, she's
like a super-genius.</font>

310
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,600
<font color="yellow">And she's been like that ever
since she was younger.</font>

311
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,498
<font color="yellow">And she'll be getting her
doctorate this year.</font>

312
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:15,100
<font color="yellow">How old is she?</font>

313
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,998
<font color="yellow">The same age as Ye Eun.
The two of them are twins.</font>

314
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:20,400
<font color="yellow">Wait, really?
Ye Eun has a twin?</font>

315
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah. They're fraternal twins,
but she's a lot prettier, and taller.</font>

316
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,198
<font color="yellow">She's pretty, and is
super smart, to boot.</font>

317
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:28,998
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that Ye Eun's felt
bad since she was young</font>

318
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:31,400
<font color="yellow">since her twin sister is so much
better than her in every way.</font>

319
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,100
<font color="yellow">Her sister got all the attention.</font>

320
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,998
<font color="yellow">And it's not like she could ever
surpass her sister in any way.</font>

321
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:41,900
<font color="yellow">It's only natural that she has low
self-esteem, with a sister like that.</font>

322
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,300
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

323
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,800
<font color="yellow">This is what happens when people with no
confidence date the wrong person.</font>

324
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,800
<font color="yellow">I thought Senior Ye Eun grew up in a
nice house, with a happy family.</font>

325
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,498
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

326
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,800
<font color="yellow">That's weird. Senior Ye Eun
said that she was an only child.</font>

327
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,900
<font color="yellow">What, did you lie to me?</font>

328
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,099
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, why would you lie to
me about something like that?</font>

329
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:16,599
<font color="yellow">After hearing my story, you thought, "I
understand why she's like that," right?</font>

330
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:21,999
<font color="yellow">So my point is, my story
isn't exactly the answer</font>

331
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:25,099
<font color="yellow">but everyone has their own
circumstances to deal with.</font>

332
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,700
<font color="yellow">And until you know
the circumstances they're in</font>

333
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,700
<font color="yellow">you can't tell people
how to live their lives.</font>

334
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,599
<font color="yellow">It's not just Ye Eun.
It's Senior Kang and Senior Yoon, too.</font>

335
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,599
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you have something
like that about you, too.</font>

336
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,800
<font color="yellow">Something that others can't understand
about you, but you can't help.</font>

337
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,599
<font color="yellow">That's why you can't
judge people willy-nilly...</font>

338
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:52,400
<font color="yellow">What? Was I acting way
too holier-than-thou?</font>

339
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,900
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

340
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,099
<font color="yellow">I just feel like...
you're really...</font>

341
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,099
<font color="yellow">Really... what?</font>

342
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,700
<font color="yellow">Cool!</font>

343
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,099
<font color="yellow">It's different than your usual self.</font>

344
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,599
<font color="yellow">What? What am I usually like, then?</font>

345
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,400
<font color="yellow">Do you usually like me, but now
you feel like you like me more?</font>

346
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,700
<font color="yellow">That's what you meant, right?</font>

347
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,200
<font color="yellow">You totally respect me, right?</font>

348
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,099
<font color="yellow">You're totally in awe
of my intellect, aren't you?</font>

349
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,099
<font color="yellow">Figures. All right,
let's get you exfoliated!</font>

company like this pay?</font>

352
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,400
<font color="yellow">- Maybe 3 to 4 million won per month?
- Wow!</font>

353
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,700
<font color="yellow">Really? Do they really
pay people that much?</font>

354
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,900
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that the monthly
salary is 3 million won.</font>

355
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,300
<font color="yellow">Then she'll only have to work for
three months to pay the debt off!</font>

356
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,099
<font color="yellow">Hey, how would she get by if she used
her entire paycheck to pay us back?</font>

357
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,099
<font color="yellow">Geez, this punk has no sympathy at all!</font>

358
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,300
<font color="yellow">We need to account
her living expenses!</font>

359
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,599
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's say that her living
expenses are 1 million won per month.</font>

360
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,599
<font color="yellow">You can pay us 2 million per month, so
5 months. 6 months, including interest.</font>

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,800
<font color="yellow">That'd be perfect!

370
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,400

there's plenty of other jobs like it.</font>

376
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,200
<font color="yellow">I can't quit.</font>

377
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:38,900
<font color="yellow">To me, this place is like a test.</font>

378
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,599
<font color="yellow">A trial run, kind of.</font>

379

I won't be able to last anywhere.</font>

Okay. Next...</font>

You didn't even tell me you'd be coming.</font>

You're not coming in?</font>

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

401
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,800
<font color="yellow">I feel like something
has changed about you!</font>

402
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:28,800
<font color="yellow">It feels like you've gotten
a bit sexier, too!</font>

403
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,200
<font color="yellow">Maybe because it's been so long
since I've seen you?</font>

404
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,099
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- Come on, why not?</font>

405
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:38,099
<font color="yellow">Stop it! I don't want to do this!</font>

406
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,800

to say, then say it</font>

411

<font color="yellow">instead of making me walk on
eggshells around you all the time!</font>

00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:03,999

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah. The skinny, pretty one.</font>

439
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,800
<font color="yellow">What about Ye Eun?</font>

440
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,700
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

441
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:27,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever. It's not
like she's a minor. Who cares?</font>

442
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever! Bye!
I'm going to sleep!</font>

443
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
<font color="yellow">Want to get out of here?</font>

444
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Sorry to ruin your fun time.</font>

445
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,700
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for a second.</font>

446
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,400
<font color="yellow">Come on.
Let's go home.</font>

447
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,599
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to!
Who do you think you are?</font>

448
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,599
<font color="yellow">I get it,
so let's talk about this at home.</font>

449
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,099
<font color="yellow">I'm not going home!
What would I even do there?</font>

450
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,400
<font color="yellow">I'm going to play here.
And drink.</font>

451
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you think that
this is free booze?</font>

452
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,099
<font color="yellow">Do you think that they're crazy,
buying you alcohol for free?</font>

453
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,700
<font color="yellow">I know.
I know.</font>

454
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,599
<font color="yellow">I'm well aware.</font>

455
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,999
<font color="yellow">She says she can come.
So do you want to play with us?</font>

456
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,200
<font color="yellow">Whatever, then.</font>

457
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,900
<font color="yellow">- You're just going to leave?
- She says she knows what she's doing.</font>

458
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,800
<font color="yellow">Just give me money for a cab.</font>

459
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,800
<font color="yellow">Let's go. It's a place where people
who know each other play together.</font>

460
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,800
<font color="yellow">- Ow!
- Get out.</font>

461
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
<font color="yellow">Who the hell do you think you are?
Why are you doing this?</font>

462
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,999
<font color="yellow">Me? I'm her lover.
Get out here!</font>

463
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:28,800
<font color="yellow">Let go! Ow!
Hey! Hey!</font>

464
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,900
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! Ow!
Let go! Let go!</font>

465
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
<font color="yellow">Hey, this hurts!
Let go!</font>

466
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, you did that on
purpose, didn't you?</font>

467
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,400
<font color="yellow">Ugh, disgusting. Why did you get
piss-drunk, if you're going to vomit?</font>

468
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
<font color="yellow">Why don't you do the city a favor and
swallow her vomit for her, then?</font>

469
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,900
<font color="yellow">It's all the same, anyway!</font>

470
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:02,400
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare fall asleep.</font>

471
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,200
<font color="yellow">- This is so humiliating!
- Good, so you know!</font>

472
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,200
<font color="yellow">Stop it! I'm done!</font>

473
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,900
<font color="yellow">Apparently, that guy is super infamous.</font>

474
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,168
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he mixed something
into your drinks.</font>

475
00:46:40,168 --> 00:46:42,999
<font color="yellow">That's why a total prude
like you got so horny.</font>

476
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
<font color="yellow">- It doesn't matter.
- You sure?</font>

477
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,700
<font color="yellow">Were you really going to
have a one-night stand?</font>

478
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,400
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

479
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:56,300
<font color="yellow">You go around doing that all the time.</font>

480
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:04,099
<font color="yellow">The guy that I like likes you,
who does that kind of thing.</font>

481
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,900
<font color="yellow">So I can't do that?</font>

482
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,999
<font color="yellow">You idiot. You thought that it'd
be a mere one-night stand?</font>

483
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:13,999
<font color="yellow">A video of you would be
floating around the web!</font>

484
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,800
<font color="yellow">You need to be more careful
about the way you rebel.</font>

485
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,200
<font color="yellow">What does that matter,
when I'm already ruined?</font>

486
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, shut up.</font>

487
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,400
<font color="yellow">You don't even have a single
scratch on you, punk, compared to me.</font>

488
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,300
<font color="yellow">I hate you.</font>

489
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,900
<font color="yellow">I hate you too.</font>

490
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,900
<font color="yellow">- You're the worst!
- Sure, sure. Let's leave it at that.</font>

491
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:41,700
<font color="yellow">I wish that you were the one
who did something wrong.</font>

492
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:48,400
<font color="yellow">Then... I'd only have to hate you.</font>

493
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,599
<font color="yellow">That'd make me feel less pathetic.</font>

494
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:58,400
<font color="yellow">Rather than having the man I love
be such a pathetic person...</font>

495
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,400
<font color="yellow">You pathetic creature.</font>

496
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,999
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do with you?</font>

497
00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:09,099
<font color="yellow">I really seem like an idiot, right?</font>

498
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:10,800
<font color="yellow">At least you're self-aware.</font>

499
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:17,400
<font color="yellow">I'm seriously such an idiot!</font>

500
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,499
<font color="yellow">Wipe yourself off.</font>

501
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,599
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

502
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,099
<font color="yellow">How is it?
Does it taste good?</font>

503
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:50,400
<font color="yellow">It's salty.</font>

504
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:55,999
<font color="yellow">Yeah. It really is salty.</font>

505
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:56,999
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

506
00:48:56,999 --> 00:48:59,200
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

507
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's so salty!
It's super salty! It's so salty.</font>

508
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:06,599
<font color="yellow">Don't eat it, then.</font>

509
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,800
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- You said it was salty.</font>

510
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
<font color="yellow">It's fine! I'm eating it!</font>

511
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
<font color="yellow">No, don't eat it!</font>

512
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,999
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat all of this, even if
the sodium level in my body doubles!</font>

513
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:15,999
<font color="yellow">- No!
- Give it!</font>

514
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:17,800
<font color="yellow">- I told you, I'm eating it!
- No, don't eat it!</font>

515
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,099
<font color="yellow">- I'm eating it!
- Give it back!</font>

516
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:21,599
<font color="yellow">- Hey! I'll eat it!
- Senior!</font>

517
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,499
<font color="yellow">Let go of her hand, right now!</font>

518
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,999
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

519
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:29,999
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

520
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:33,200
<font color="yellow">What you're doing right now
is sexual harassment!</font>

521
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,400
<font color="yellow">Being all touchy-feely with just anyone!</font>

522
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,700
<font color="yellow">And you!
Get it together!</font>

523
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,599
<font color="yellow">If you don't like it,
speak up and say so!</font>

524
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,400
<font color="yellow">It's because of passive girls like you
that sexual harassment is still an issue!</font>

525
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,099
<font color="yellow">Hey, what do you mean,
sexual harassment?</font>

526
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:48,700
<font color="yellow">- We're--
- Sorry.</font>

527
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,599
<font color="yellow">"Sorry?"</font>

528
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,800
<font color="yellow">"Sorry," huh?
You're sorry?</font>

529
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,400
<font color="yellow">What are you sorry about?</font>

530
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,800
<font color="yellow">The fact that you didn't
push my hand away?</font>

531
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,599
<font color="yellow">Or the fact that you weren't angry
about being "sexually harassed?"</font>

532
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,099
<font color="yellow">Why can't you speak up?</font>

533
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,900
<font color="yellow">Why couldn't you say, "he's my man?"</font>

534
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,599
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

535
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,400
<font color="yellow">It just came out of my mouth
before I realized it.</font>

536
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,900
<font color="yellow">So you disowned me
without even realizing it?</font>

537
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,999
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are, Apostle Peter?</font>

538
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,300
<font color="yellow">Disowning me three times,
like he did to Jesus?</font>

539
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,099
<font color="yellow">You better tell that girl
tomorrow that we're dating.</font>

540
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,400
<font color="yellow">What, you don't want to?
Why not, though?</font>

541
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
<font color="yellow">Are you ashamed of me,
by any chance?</font>

542
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,099
<font color="yellow">No! That's not it.</font>

543
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:52,499
<font color="yellow">Then?</font>

544
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,400
<font color="yellow">Well... it still hasn't hit me yet.</font>

545
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,999
<font color="yellow">The fact that you like
me feels like a lie...</font>

546
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:09,599
<font color="yellow">and the fact that someone likes me
makes me feel like I'm dreaming.</font>

547
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,999
<font color="yellow">I want to show you off,
but I feel like I shouldn't.</font>

548
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:18,599
<font color="yellow">And it's the first time I've ever
liked someone like this, so...</font>

549
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,599
<font color="yellow">it makes me happy.
But it makes me uneasy.</font>

550
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:25,300
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I should do.</font>

551
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,900
<font color="yellow">I'm quite a frustrating person, aren't I?</font>

552
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,599
<font color="yellow">Are you really angry?</font>

553
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

554
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,099
<font color="yellow">Do you... not like me anymore,
by any chance?</font>

555
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,099
<font color="yellow">You're actually a pro at
dating, aren't you?</font>

556
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,300
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

557
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,200
<font color="yellow">You're playing hard-to-get
right now, right?</font>

558
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,700
<font color="yellow">- N-no.
- You little!</font>

559
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,099
<font color="yellow">You little rascal!</font>

560
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,800
<font color="yellow">Senior, I have to go to class.</font>

561
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,200
<font color="yellow">Stay for just five more minutes.</font>

562
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,999
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

563
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:05,200
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, you're so obedient!</font>

564
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,999
<font color="yellow">You seductress.</font>

565
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,099
<font color="yellow"><i>Why do you even like me?</i></font>

566
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,099
<font color="yellow"><i>What do you like about
a bastard like me?</i></font>

567
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:27,400
<font color="yellow"><i>There's countless reasons
why I shouldn't like that man.</i></font>

568
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,999
<font color="yellow"><i>Why are you being so nice?</i></font>

569
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:31,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Because I don't know when
I'll be mean to you again.</i></font>

570
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,999
<font color="yellow"><i>And the worst thing
among those reasons...</i></font>

571
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:37,800
<font color="yellow"><i>- is that...</i>
- Get the hell out!</font>

572
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,599
<font color="yellow"><i>he doesn't like me.</i></font>

573
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:50,900
<font color="yellow"><i>There's countless reasons
why I shouldn't like that man.</i></font>

574
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:03,400
<font color="yellow">You're late today, too.</font>

575
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,499
<font color="yellow">It's because you called me out,
out of nowhere!</font>

576
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,800
<font color="yellow">What? What is it that you
need to talk about?</font>

577
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,400
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

578
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,599
<font color="yellow">Let me drink my coffee first.</font>

579
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,800
<font color="yellow">You've really been getting
on my nerves lately.</font>

580
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,999
<font color="yellow">- Can I get an iced Americano, please?
- Yes, sir.</font>

581
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,599
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

582
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
