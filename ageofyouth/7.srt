take me for, punk?</font>

95

<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Just a second!</font>

96

<font color="yellow">When you first started going
out with your boyfriend...</font>

97
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,929
<font color="yellow">how did things start off?</font>

98
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:09,529
<font color="yellow">So, um... did you two say,
"we're dating now!"</font>

99
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,328
<font color="yellow">Or did you two start things off
more naturally?</font>

<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

101
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,228
<font color="yellow">Well... just because.</font>

102
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:21,029
<font color="yellow">Your man is being lukewarm, eh?</font>

103
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,728
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that, but...</font>

104
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,728
<font color="yellow">You know, kids nowadays
are so sly that they do everything</font>

105
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,728
<font color="yellow">that should be saved for a
proper relationship, without dating.</font>

106
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,728
<font color="yellow">- That's called "hooking up."
- Really?</font>

107
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:32,529
<font color="yellow">Well, did he officially ask you out?</font>

108
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,828
<font color="yellow">- Officially--
- "You and I are dating, starting today."</font>

109
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:38,429
<font color="yellow">Or something along those lines.</font>

110
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,228
<font color="yellow">Did you and your boyfriend
start off like that?</font>

111
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:45,128
<font color="yellow">Of course! He gave me flowers saying,
"this is our first day as a couple."</font>

112
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:48,029
<font color="yellow">Did he say for sure that he likes you?</font>

113
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,728
<font color="yellow">Well, there was just that time,
here, at the house...</font>

114
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:55,128
<font color="yellow">- That's not a confession!
- No, it isn't!</font>

115
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,929
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to look
each other in the eye</font>

116
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,728
<font color="yellow">and say, "I like you.
Do you like me back?"</font>

117
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:05,128
<font color="yellow">Yeah! If he's going to do things
properly, he should be on his knees!</font>

118
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:08,429
<font color="yellow">Well yes, but times have changed.</font>

119
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:12,728
<font color="yellow">Let's stop.
We're going to make her cry.</font>

120
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:15,128
<font color="yellow">You're uneasy about a
lot of things, right?</font>

121
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,328
<font color="yellow">You feel like he may have said
that he liked you impulsively</font>

122
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:18,628
<font color="yellow">and it feels like you're the
only one that likes him.</font>

123
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:20,228
<font color="yellow">Did you feel that way, too?</font>

124
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:25,128
<font color="yellow">You know, your phone is really silent.
Shouldn't it be going off like crazy?</font>

125
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:27,828
<font color="yellow">Yeah. And you miss him,
even if you're with him!</font>

126
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,128
<font color="yellow">And whenever you turn a corner,
you think about him!</font>

127
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,128
<font color="yellow">And when you wake up,
there's a text from him!</font>

128
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,029
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, it's so fun to tease you.</font>

129
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,728
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

130
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:46,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, so he is hitting you up! Whoo!</font>

131
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,029
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

132
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,128
<font color="yellow">Oh, never mind.</font>

133
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:56,029
<font color="yellow">I bet she's in for a hard time.</font>

134
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,728
<font color="yellow">When girls like her
date for the first time--</font>

135
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:01,628
<font color="yellow">Mom! I can't understand what
you're saying, if you talk like that!</font>

136
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,029
<font color="yellow">Here, breathe first.</font>

137
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:07,529
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?
All right, talk to me.</font>

138
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:11,929
<font color="yellow">There was a car accident,
so they're at the hospital now?</font>

139
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,929
<font color="yellow">Then first, take a cab
to the hospital. Got it?</font>

140
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,029
<font color="yellow">I'll call you again in 30 minutes.</font>

141
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:26,029
<font color="yellow">I think I have to go.
Something came up with my family.</font>

142

<font color="yellow">Huh? Okay.</font>

143
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:58,128
<font color="yellow">Huh? You're here, Eun Jae?</font>

144
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,929
<font color="yellow">You were the one who got hurt, Mister?</font>

145
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,728
<font color="yellow">Oh, um... I just got a small scratch.</font>

146
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:06,429
<font color="yellow">Your mom overreacted again, didn't she?</font>

147
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:11,128
<font color="yellow">She said that the car crashed
into a truck, so I was shocked.</font>

148
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:13,128
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

149
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,128
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:22,228
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jung Yi? Ms. Jung Yi.
Eun Jae is here.</font>

151
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:23,529
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

152
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,128
<font color="yellow">Eun Jae.</font>

153
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:39,228
<font color="yellow">I really thought something terrible
had happened!</font>

154
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,429
<font color="yellow">He was bleeding so much from his head--</font>

155
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,029
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
It wasn't like that at all!</font>

156
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,529
<font color="yellow">I only bled a teeny bit!</font>

157
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,529
<font color="yellow">Geez, thinking about how
shocked I was before...</font>

158
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,429
<font color="yellow">All right, all right.
I'm sorry.</font>

159
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:55,429
<font color="yellow">Here, have some ice cream.</font>

160
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,128
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

161
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,929
<font color="yellow">Do you want this, Eun Jae?</font>

162
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,128
<font color="yellow">No, that's fine.
I'll go and wash my hands.</font>

163
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:16,029
<font color="yellow">- This is so good!
- It's good?</font>

164
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:20,929
<font color="yellow">That's good.
All right, eat up.</font>

165
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,228
<font color="yellow">Well, that's how it is.</font>

166
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:26,029
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped.
Thanks for a fun time up until now.</font>

167
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:40,529
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you sometime.
- Don't.</font>

168
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,429
<font color="yellow">If you do, it'll be hard for
me to forget about you.</font>

169
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,529
<font color="yellow">If we're breaking up,
it's best to break off all contact.</font>

170
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,328
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

171
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:54,328
<font color="yellow">Would you like to order?</font>

172
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,529
<font color="yellow">I'll have the jjajangmyun.</font>

173
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,728
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

174
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,328
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll get that for you.</font>

175
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,929
<font color="yellow"><i>Men are so simple.</i></font>

176
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,128
<font color="yellow">When they're trying to win you over,
they buy you multi-course meals</font>

177
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:16,029
<font color="yellow">but whenever you're breaking up, it's
always jjajangmyun or jjamppong.</font>

178
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, but if it's sushi,
you know that he's loaded!</font>

179
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,529
<font color="yellow">How come you've never told me
not to live like this, though?</font>

180
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,328
<font color="yellow">I don't have the right to tell
others how to live their lives.</font>

181
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,529
<font color="yellow">What kind of work do you do, Mister?</font>

182
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:36,228
<font color="yellow">Oh. How about this?</font>

183
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,929
<font color="yellow">Let's ask each other one thing
we're curious about.</font>

184
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,728
<font color="yellow">I'll start things off.</font>

185
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:44,628
<font color="yellow">Do you have a lover, or a wife?</font>

186
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:48,728
<font color="yellow">What? Why not?</font>

187
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:50,728
<font color="yellow">It's my turn, isn't it?</font>

188
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,429
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

189
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,228
<font color="yellow">Why do you live your life like that?</font>

190
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:01,929
<font color="yellow">What the hell? This is different
from what you just said.</font>

191
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,429
<font color="yellow">I'm not telling you
not to live that way.</font>

192
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:08,628
<font color="yellow">I'm just wondering if there's
a specific reason why.</font>

193
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:13,529
<font color="yellow">It's hard to explain, but...</font>

194
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,328
<font color="yellow">Let's say that you're crossing
the street on the crosswalk.</font>

195
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:19,029
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to cross when
the light is green, right?</font>

196
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,728
<font color="yellow">And you're supposed to be
careful while doing so.</font>

197
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:26,628
<font color="yellow">But, if you get hit by a
drunk driver, you're done for.</font>

198
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,929
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

199
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,328
<font color="yellow">So what I'm trying to say is, you don't
know what may happen to you, in life.</font>

200
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,728
<font color="yellow">So what's the point of
living a diligent life?</font>

201
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,328
<font color="yellow">Living recklessly is the best!</font>

202
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:43,128
<font color="yellow">You know, people who open 10-year
investment accounts fascinate me.</font>

203
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:47,029
<font color="yellow">How does that person know that
they'll still be alive in ten years?</font>

204
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,929
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

205
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,328
<font color="yellow">It's my turn now, right?</font>

206
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,628
<font color="yellow">Why did you cry that day?</font>

207
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:01,029
<font color="yellow">The night you did the shadow puppets.</font>

208
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,529
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

209
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,328
<font color="yellow">Well...
rather than saying that I cried...</font>

210
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:10,828
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

211
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,728
<font color="yellow">It's because I was reminded of the past.</font>

212
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:17,929
<font color="yellow">About what, exactly?</font>

213
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,728
<font color="yellow">When I used to play with my daughter.</font>

214
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:24,029
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

215
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,728
<font color="yellow">She's dead now.</font>

216
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,029
<font color="yellow">It's your turn now, Mister.</font>

217
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:45,128
<font color="yellow">What you said before, about not
knowing what'll happen to you in life...</font>

218
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:48,429
<font color="yellow">how did you come to think like that?
You're still quite young.</font>

219
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:55,228
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth...</font>

220
00:16:55,228 --> 00:17:00,128
<font color="yellow">I've been on TV before.
And in the newspaper, too.</font>

221
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:05,428
<font color="yellow">Once, I went on a trip in high school,
and almost died.</font>

222
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:10,928
<font color="yellow">People say that life seems precious when
they have a close-to-death encounter</font>

223
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:13,229
<font color="yellow">but that wasn't the case for me.</font>

224
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:17,328
<font color="yellow">Nothing felt real, no matter what I did.</font>

225
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:21,729
<font color="yellow">And concepts like the future, or a
future career all seemed like a joke.</font>

226
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,628
<font color="yellow">And I didn't want to study anymore.</font>

227
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,928
<font color="yellow">Well, I never liked studying,
anyway, but...</font>

228
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:33,729
<font color="yellow">It's my turn now, right?</font>

229
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:39,628
<font color="yellow">What kind of women do you like, Mister?</font>

230
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:43,229
<font color="yellow">What kind of woman is your ideal type?</font>

231
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,828
<font color="yellow">I don't really have anything like that.</font>

232
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:48,029
<font color="yellow">Come on, you can't pass on a question.
You have to answer everything.</font>

233
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,729
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

234
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,328
<font color="yellow">An innocent girl
with long, flowing hair?</font>

235
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,128
<font color="yellow">A black girl?</font>

236
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:59,229
<font color="yellow">A woman with hair like Shin Saimdang,
with her hair all done up?</font>

237
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,529
<font color="yellow">Which one is it? Tell me!</font>

238
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:03,029
<font color="yellow">If you don't tell me,
I'll just keep going.</font>

239
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:04,928
<font color="yellow">A glamorous woman?</font>

240
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:11,229
<font color="yellow">Back in my day,
short hair was all the rage.</font>

241
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,928
<font color="yellow">A short-haired girl, eh?</font>

242
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,128
<font color="yellow">Ask me your question.</font>

243
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:24,229
<font color="yellow">How did you survive that accident?</font>

244
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,229
<font color="yellow">Why are you curious about that?</font>

245
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:28,729
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

246
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,928
<font color="yellow">There was no method, per se.
It was all just luck.</font>

247
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:37,029
<font color="yellow">Just like drawing straws.</font>

248
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:43,128
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because of my
personality, or my age.</font>

249
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:51,729
<font color="yellow"><i>It's red. It's angry.
It's full of rage.</i></font>

250
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,529
<font color="yellow"><i>It's the ghost of someone
who was murdered.</i></font>

251
00:18:56,128 --> 00:19:00,029
<font color="yellow">This is no fun.
Let's stop, and just drink.</font>

252
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:29,128
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you get home?
How's your mom?</i></font>

253
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:39,928
<font color="yellow">I can't fall asleep,
trying to sleep by myself.</font>

254
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,029
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep with another
person in my bed.</font>

255
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:49,229
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's fine! I won't
move an inch while I'm sleeping!</font>

256
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,428
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll get in touch with you later.</i></font>

257
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,029
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

258
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,628
<font color="yellow">Nobody.</font>

259
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:11,928
<font color="yellow">Ah, this is so nice!
So nice! So nice! So nice!</font>

260
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:14,229
<font color="yellow">Does Mister know about this side of you?</font>

261
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:17,328
<font color="yellow">Yeah. He says that it's cute.</font>

262
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,729
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

263
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:28,529
<font color="yellow">Did you get a call from your
dad's sister, by any chance?</font>

264
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,229
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

265
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:36,928
<font color="yellow">They're moving,
but they're short on cash.</font>

266
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:39,529
<font color="yellow">So they kind of seem as if they
want me to give them some money.</font>

267
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,229
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

268
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:47,029
<font color="yellow">Just pretend like you don't notice.
Whatever.</font>

269
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:53,229
<font color="yellow">But, she knows how much life insurance
money we got from your father's death!</font>

270
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:57,128
<font color="yellow">I'd feel bad acting like I don't notice.</font>

271
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:59,428
<font color="yellow">Should we give them
a little bit of money?</font>

272
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,529
<font color="yellow">Don't!</font>

273
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,428
<font color="yellow">If you give them money once,
they'll keep asking for it.</font>

274
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:06,529
<font color="yellow">But still--</font>

275
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,529
<font color="yellow">That money isn't yours!</font>

276
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,729
<font color="yellow">Oh... fine, then.</font>

277
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:17,128
<font color="yellow">You know, you get
really scary sometimes.</font>

278
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,029
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

279
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:50,928
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

280
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's okay.</font>

281
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,529
<font color="yellow">It's okay.
It's okay.</font>

282
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,029
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

283
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:31,128
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

284
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:38,529
<font color="yellow">Do you think about Dad?</font>

285
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:46,229
<font color="yellow">Of course.
I do, sometimes.</font>

286
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,229
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

287
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:51,128
<font color="yellow">He just pops into my mind
every now and then.</font>

288
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:54,529
<font color="yellow">If I see someone that looks similar
to him, I think about him</font>

289
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:58,428
<font color="yellow">and I think about him when
I see his favorite foods.</font>

290
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:01,378
<font color="yellow">I saw some peaches
when I went to Janghae last time</font>

291
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:04,328
<font color="yellow">and I thought of your dad.</font>

292
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:06,529
<font color="yellow">Your dad loved peaches.</font>

293
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:12,328
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'd be eating tons of
peaches if he were still alive.</font>

294
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:17,029
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm sure he's eating all the
peaches he wants, in heaven.</font>

295
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,729
<font color="yellow">Heaven?</font>

296
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,729
<font color="yellow">Well, yeah.
Since he was a good person.</font>

297
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,229
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he went to heaven.</font>

298
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:25,029
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

299
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,729
<font color="yellow">You should feel thankful toward me, Mom.</font>

300
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:49,229
<font color="yellow">You should really feel
thankful toward me, Mom.</font>

301
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,229
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

302
00:24:29,328 --> 00:24:31,628
<font color="yellow">I'll show you to your seat.</font>

303
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:03,529
<font color="yellow">I wanted to drop by here,
since I heard that it just opened.</font>

304
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:06,029
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat?</font>

305
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,128
<font color="yellow">The menu looks similar to ours.</font>

306
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:13,029
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

307
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,729
<font color="yellow">What's the chef's special here?</font>

308
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:19,428
<font color="yellow">I'm someone with lots of money.</font>

309
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:22,229
<font color="yellow">It's not in the millions range.
It's billions of won.</font>

310
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,529
<font color="yellow">So why would a person like
that open a restaurant?</font>

311
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,428
<font color="yellow">To make pennies off
the business, as profit?</font>

312
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:30,428
<font color="yellow">No. I'm just working on the details,
while working on a much bigger picture.</font>

313
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,928
<font color="yellow">On production, distribution,
and sales, too.</font>

314
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:35,928
<font color="yellow">I'm starting off getting
involved in a business</font>

315
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:39,229
<font color="yellow">and I think I'll be in charge
of a chain restaurant.</font>

316
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:43,928
<font color="yellow">I have to start a new business, but...</font>

317
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,428
<font color="yellow">I need someone who has
relevant work experience</font>

318
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:50,229
<font color="yellow">but knows about
business management, too.</font>

319
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:54,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, but did you say that you were aiming
to work for a huge conglomerate?</font>

320
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:57,029
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Really?</font>

321
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:59,128
<font color="yellow">That was the best, back in the day.</font>

322
00:25:59,128 --> 00:26:01,328
<font color="yellow">Well, that's taken care of.</font>

323
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:06,628
<font color="yellow">I've watched you for a long time, and
I know what kind of person you are.</font>

324
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:08,428
<font color="yellow">I do, but...</font>

325
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:12,529
<font color="yellow">I don't know if you're
loyal to me or not.</font>

326
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,529
<font color="yellow">Mr. Manager!</font>

327
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:18,928
<font color="yellow">- Oh!
- Hello.</font>

328
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:19,928
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

329
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:23,029
<font color="yellow">I heard that this place just opened up,
so I wanted to see what it was like.</font>

330
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,029
<font color="yellow">It's similar to what
I imagined it'd be like.</font>

331
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:26,428
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

332
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:29,428
<font color="yellow">how are you going to manage to scope the
place out, when it's just you two men?</font>

333
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:32,529
<font color="yellow">Well, we just need to know how
skilled their kitchen staff is, so...</font>

334
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,029
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, then.
- Yes.</font>

335
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,628
<font color="yellow">Please take a seat here.</font>

336
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:02,428
<font color="yellow">It seems like it's mostly
steak on their menu.</font>

337
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,529
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Eat up.</font>

338
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:20,828
<font color="yellow">Well? How is it?</font>

339
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:25,128
<font color="yellow">- It's crappy.
- What?</font>

340
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:27,529
<font color="yellow">It's not that bad.</font>

341
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,828
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

342
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:53,628
<font color="yellow">A little.</font>

343
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,128
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt a lot?</font>

344
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:03,328
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, you should've been careful!</font>

345
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:07,729
<font color="yellow">Your body isn't yours anymore!
Half of it is mine now!</font>

346
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,928
<font color="yellow">All right?
I'm serious!</font>

347
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:13,529
<font color="yellow">I can point out exactly which
parts of you are mine now, but...</font>

348
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:20,328
<font color="yellow">Is your mom okay?</font>

349
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,029
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

350
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:28,428
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. You said you'd contact me
yesterday, so why didn't you?</font>

351
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:31,128
<font color="yellow">Are you playing hard to get with me?</font>

352
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:34,229
<font color="yellow">Geez, you just went and learned
the bad stuff, didn't you?</font>

353
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:51,428
<font color="yellow">It's fine. You can touch it.</font>

354
00:30:56,428 --> 00:30:59,229
<font color="yellow">I'm completely yours, so...</font>

355
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:01,229
<font color="yellow">touch me as much as you want.</font>

356
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:12,428
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

357
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:16,328
<font color="yellow">You're terrible.
How could you call me "Senior?"</font>

358
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:21,428
<font color="yellow">You could call me "Honey," "Darling,"
or even "Mr. Jong Yeol!"</font>

359
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,928
<font color="yellow">What? What do you want to say?</font>

360
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:33,928
<font color="yellow">Can you buy me some ice cream?</font>

361
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,928
<font color="yellow">Ice cream?</font>

362
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:43,628
<font color="yellow">I saw someone eating it yesterday,
and I've been wanting some since then.</font>

363
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:45,628
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you buy
one for yourself, then?</font>

364
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:50,029
<font color="yellow">Because I wanted to ask you
to buy it for me.</font>

365
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,529
<font color="yellow">Sheesh!</font>

366
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:58,428
<font color="yellow">So you know how to say cute things too,
my little troublemaker?</font>

367
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,928
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll buy you some ice cream.</font>

368
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,398
<font color="yellow">- It's delicious!
- Is it?</font>

369
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:36,898
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom, you should be thankful toward me.</i></font>

370
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:39,800
<font color="yellow"><i>You really should be thankful toward me.</i></font>

371
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,329
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

372
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:29,530
<font color="yellow">Did you have a prior engagement?</font>

373
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:32,731
<font color="yellow">I have to go to my part-time job
at the convenience store.</font>

374
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:35,731
<font color="yellow">You don't need to do things
like that anymore.</font>

375
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:37,530
<font color="yellow">If the project I told you
about before goes well</font>

376
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,431
<font color="yellow">you won't have to do part-time jobs.</font>

377
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,231
<font color="yellow">Let down your hair.</font>

378
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,829
<font color="yellow">It looks a lot nicer down.</font>

379
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,931
<font color="yellow">How about you transform a bit,
once in a while?</font>

380
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:04,231
<font color="yellow">It's no fun if you look the
same all the time.</font>

381
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:08,330
<font color="yellow">Take your hands off.
That hairstyle looks better on you.</font>

382
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:14,330
<font color="yellow">Have some self-confidence.</font>

383
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,430
<font color="yellow">The more confident a woman is,
the prettier she is.</font>

384
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,729
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

385
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:00,330
<font color="yellow">thought that we were going to a cafe,
or something like that.</font>

386
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:04,930
<font color="yellow">How could we talk about important things
at a place like a coffee shop?</font>

387
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,531
<font color="yellow">And it won't create the
right atmosphere, either.</font>

388
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:10,830
<font color="yellow">It's quiet here, so it's
perfect for talking.</font>

389
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:43,930
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Come inside.</font>

390
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,129
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? You're here,
already. Stop acting old-fashioned.</font>

391
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,031
<font color="yellow">It's Pororo.</font>

392
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:58,229
<font color="yellow">I had these at my house, too.</font>

393
00:35:58,229 --> 00:36:00,930
<font color="yellow">It's pretty common to see
everywhere, isn't it?</font>

394
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,229
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's pretty common to see.</font>

395
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,729
<font color="yellow">It's nothing major.</font>

396
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:17,729
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it,
they're not too different than me.</font>

397
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:19,930
<font color="yellow">But for some strange reason,
they make me scared</font>

398
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,330
<font color="yellow">and make things hard for me.</font>

399
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:28,330
<font color="yellow">Just like someone who has an
overwhelming amount of power.</font>

400
00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:33,430
<font color="yellow">I guess other people can haunt you, too.</font>

401
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,830
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

402
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,430
<font color="yellow">You make me feel
as if I'm being haunted.</font>

403
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,031
<font color="yellow">As if I'm stuck in sleep paralysis.</font>

404
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:42,531
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

405
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:44,729
<font color="yellow">Are you just going to
keep standing there?</font>

406
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,830
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say to me,
I'll listen to you from here.</font>

407
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:54,129
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to talk about
something important while I'm standing?</font>

408
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:57,229
<font color="yellow">Hey, have you even heard anything
that I've said to you thus far?</font>

409
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:59,531
<font color="yellow">I need to confirm for myself
whether or not you're loyal to me--</font>

410
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:01,930
<font color="yellow">And what does it mean
to be loyal to you?</font>

411
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,830
<font color="yellow">Just the two of us drinking alcohol,
at a place like this?</font>

412
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:10,229
<font color="yellow">If that's what it entails, I have no
intention of becoming loyal to you.</font>

413
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:15,930
<font color="yellow">You... hey.</font>

414
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,330
<font color="yellow">You still haven't hit
rock-bottom yet, have you?</font>

415
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,729
<font color="yellow">No. I have hit rock-bottom.</font>

416
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,981
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm suffering from this</font>

417
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:26,229
<font color="yellow">"sleep paralysis"
you're putting me through</font>

418
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:29,031
<font color="yellow">and that's why...</font>

419
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:31,229
<font color="yellow">I came all the way here, too.</font>

420
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:41,129
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing to say,
I'll be going now.</font>

421
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:44,830
<font color="yellow">Fine. Go, if you want to go.</font>

422
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,830
<font color="yellow">I'm not driving you back, though.</font>

423
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,531
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

424
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:55,330
<font color="yellow">There's no more buses for today.</font>

425
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,830
<font color="yellow">Where are you headed?</font>

426
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,729
<font color="yellow">Get in. I'll take you
wherever you need to go.</font>

427
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,930
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

428
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,930
<font color="yellow">Senior, the water is boiling!</font>

429
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:59,031
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Are you okay?</font>

430
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:00,930
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Did you burn yourself?</font>

431
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,330
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

432
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:05,430
<font color="yellow">Oh, you should've been more careful!</font>

433
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,031
<font color="yellow">Looks like you're quite unlucky lately.</font>

434
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,830
<font color="yellow">You keep getting hurt.</font>

435
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,330
<font color="yellow">I know the reason why.</font>

436
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,129
<font color="yellow">It's because she's distracted,
thanks to her Honey.</font>

437
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:19,330
<font color="yellow">You dating scamps!</font>

438
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,729
<font color="yellow">How dare you leave me in the dust and
get yourself a boyfriend before me?</font>

439
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:25,729
<font color="yellow">You wicked thing! So, how did you do it?
How did you seduce him, huh?</font>

440
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:28,031
<font color="yellow">What's your secret?
What does he like about you?</font>

441
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:29,729
<font color="yellow">Your depressing attitude?
Your puppy-like face?</font>

442
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:31,430
<font color="yellow">Your flat chest?</font>

443
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,531
<font color="yellow">What, are you laughing?</font>

444
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,531
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm pissed as it is!
How dare you laugh!</font>

445
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:38,729
<font color="yellow">Tell me how you seduced him, right now!</font>

446
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,330
<font color="yellow">Spit it out!</font>

447
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:43,531
<font color="yellow">He said that my smile is cute.</font>

448
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:47,930
<font color="yellow">Your smile?
I can do that, too!</font>

449
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,430
<font color="yellow">Stop smiling!
It's so creepy!</font>

450
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,129
<font color="yellow">But didn't our Eun Soon
like a different guy?</font>

451
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:56,031
<font color="yellow">Yeah, the guy who looks like
he jumped out of the 80s!</font>

452
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:58,930
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind?</font>

453
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:01,830
<font color="yellow">- I like her.
- What?</font>

454
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,830
<font color="yellow">I said, I like her!</font>

455
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,729
<font color="yellow">What? Are you serious?</font>

456
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:10,031
<font color="yellow">Wait, so you like him just because
he said that he likes you?</font>

457
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:14,531
<font color="yellow">How dare you date
in such a passive manner!</font>

458
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:16,129
<font color="yellow">- Break up with him, right now!
- What?</font>

459
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:18,031
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do
if he says that he doesn't like you?</font>

460
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:19,330
<font color="yellow">Are you going to hate him, too?</font>

461
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,629
<font color="yellow">Just break up with him.</font>

462
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:22,780
<font color="yellow">You should be an independent
woman who don't need no man!</font>

463
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,930
<font color="yellow">This is the 21st Century!</font>

464
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,729
<font color="yellow">And you're any better, when you're
desperately seeking out a man? Shut up.</font>

465
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:29,930
<font color="yellow">It's not like you need to actually date
to know how it works!</font>

466
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,729
<font color="yellow">Do you need to eat it to know
if it's bean paste or just poop?</font>

467
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:33,729
<font color="yellow">- Yep.
- Damn it!</font>

468
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:35,330
<font color="yellow">Hey, shut up.</font>

469
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,330
<font color="yellow">All you need to do is
remember this one thing.</font>

470
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:42,129
<font color="yellow">Just like the other person
less than they like you.</font>

471
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:44,531
<font color="yellow">What if you end up liking
them more, though?</font>

472
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:47,129
<font color="yellow">You have to hide that fact,
and pretend like you like them less.</font>

473
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,531
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to do that?</font>

474
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:49,830
<font color="yellow">Yeah, do you really have to do that?</font>

475
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,930
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want, if you want
to be at the other person's mercy.</font>

476
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,531
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Just like him
as much as you like him.</font>

477
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:59,031
<font color="yellow">Like him as much as your heart desires!</font>

478
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:02,531
<font color="yellow">The fact that you have someone that
you like is a blessing in itself.</font>

479
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,330
<font color="yellow">But if the person that you like
actually likes you back</font>

480
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,729
<font color="yellow">that's a straight-up miracle.</font>

481
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:07,531

<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

489
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:40,629
<font color="yellow">This is bad. Did you think babies
just pop out of people's bellybuttons?</font>

490
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:42,031
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

491
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:44,330

brought people babies, right?</font>

492
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:49,330
<font color="yellow">Senior, have you seen "that," too?</font>

493
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,129
<font color="yellow">Yeah. When I was in ninth grade.</font>

been ready for ages</font>

<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

594
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,531
<font color="yellow">You're back early. You sure have
a lot of stamina,  huh?</font>

595
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:24,129
<font color="yellow">Can you put this on for me?</font>

596
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:32,229
<font color="yellow">Did you take my bracelet,
by any chance?</font>

597
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:38,430
<font color="yellow">It's a blue plastic bracelet.
It's not really your type, though.</font>

598
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,229
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me, then?</font>

599
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:41,830
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

600
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me about your stuff?</font>

601
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,830
<font color="yellow">Because you take my stuff
and use it sometimes.</font>

602
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,229
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

603
00:53:49,031 --> 00:53:51,430
<font color="yellow">Never mind, then.</font>

604
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,830
<font color="yellow">Don't touch what's mine.</font>

605
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,330
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

606
00:53:57,531 --> 00:54:00,430
<font color="yellow">If you do, I'll kill you.</font>

607
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:08,031
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

608
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:36,830
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know what that
bastard said to her</i></font>

609
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,830
<font color="yellow">but I didn't do a single thing to her!</font>

610
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:43,629
<font color="yellow">What the hell am I supposed to do about
her dumbass boyfriend contacting me?</font>

611
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:45,830
<font color="yellow">Damn it, this pisses me off.
That crazy bitch.</font>

612
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,031
<font color="yellow">Only she would like a pathetic
bastard like him.</font>

613
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:50,729
<font color="yellow">I'd refuse even if you brought me
a truckload of those kinds of guys!</font>

614
00:54:52,729 --> 00:54:56,129
<font color="yellow">Is that bracelet important to you?</font>

615
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:59,430
<font color="yellow">It's a cheap thing that
they sell on the street.</font>

616
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:02,729
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, really, but...</font>

617
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:05,729
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

618
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:10,729
<font color="yellow">Well, it's kind of a good-luck charm.</font>

619
00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:17,729
<font color="yellow">You know how they say that lightning
doesn't strike the same tree twice?</font>

620
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:20,830
<font color="yellow">It's kind of like that.</font>

621
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,531
<font color="yellow">It's kind of my souvenir from
when I almost died, but lived.</font>

622
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:02,129
<font color="yellow">Are you sick, Madame Jung?</font>

623
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:03,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you so quiet?</font>

624
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:10,830
<font color="yellow">About that... you said that it was the
ghost of someone who was murdered.</font>

625
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:18,729
<font color="yellow">It's just like saying, "this tastes like
a persimmon" when eating persimmon.</font>

626
00:56:18,729 --> 00:56:22,129
<font color="yellow">I just said what I felt,
so to ask me why--</font>

627
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,229
<font color="yellow">It might be a premature ghost.</font>

628
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:35,729
<font color="yellow">It could be a ghost that will be
murdered later, but has appeared now.</font>

629
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,729
<font color="yellow">What the hell?
Why is she being so scary?</font>

630
00:58:12,229 --> 00:58:15,729
<font color="yellow">Where did you go?
I thought you left.</font>

631
00:58:15,729 --> 00:58:17,830
<font color="yellow">I just had to use the bathroom.</font>

632
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:21,031
<font color="yellow">You know, you're a little weird.</font>

633
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:23,531
<font color="yellow">What, because I come to places
like these, even though I'm broke?</font>

634
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:26,129
<font color="yellow">No, it's not anything like that.</font>

635
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:29,830
<font color="yellow">The way you look at me is different
than the way everyone else looks at me.</font>

636
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,930
<font color="yellow">How so?</font>

637
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,330
<font color="yellow">You have no lust in your eyes.</font>

638
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:48,830
<font color="yellow">How funny.</font>

639
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:53,531
<font color="yellow">Want to date me, Mister?</font>

640
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:56,330
<font color="yellow">I have a slot open now.</font>

641
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:59,330
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a discount,
since you're poor.</font>

642
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:02,830
<font color="yellow">You don't have to give me
spending money</font>

643
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,830
<font color="yellow">and you can just eat with me sometimes.</font>

644
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,129
<font color="yellow">And drink with me.</font>

645
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:11,330
<font color="yellow">And hear what I have to say.</font>

646
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,229
<font color="yellow">Wow, way to put me in a bad mood.</font>

647
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:15,930
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

648
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,031
<font color="yellow">You're poor and old.</font>

649
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:26,031
<font color="yellow">I'm trash, and I'm rotten...</font>

650
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,129
<font color="yellow">and I've killed someone.</font>

651
00:59:32,629 --> 00:59:35,430
<font color="yellow">So how about we just go for it?</font>

652
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:47,430
<font color="yellow">Want to go with me somewhere, for a bit?</font>

653
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,031
<font color="yellow">Where is this?</font>

654
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,531
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

655
01:00:47,129 --> 01:00:48,930
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

656
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:55,729
<font color="yellow">This is your good-luck charm, huh?
What do you mean by that?</font>

657
01:00:57,129 --> 01:00:59,830
<font color="yellow">Why do you have this?</font>

658
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:03,830
<font color="yellow">What did you mean when you
said that you killed someone?</font>

659
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,531

660

originally owned this bracelet!</font>

661
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:32,531
<font color="yellow">Tell me! Why do you
have my daughter's bracelet?</font>

662
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:34,031
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me!</font>

663
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:39,330
<font color="yellow">Did you kill my daughter?</font>

664
