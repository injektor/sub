00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,900
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a discount on one of them.</font>

149
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
<font color="yellow">How much of a discount?</font>

150
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,500
<font color="yellow">10 percent off the retail price?</font>

151
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
<font color="yellow">Senior Kang.</font>

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,900
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this because of the
ghost over there, by any chance?</font>

153
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,000
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is...</font>

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
<font color="yellow">is this sudden change of heart related
to the ghost in the shoe closet?</font>

155
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, never mind.
It's nothing.</font>

156
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,500
<font color="yellow">Continue on with what you were doing.</font>

157
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,590
<font color="yellow">I'm here to sell some bags.</font>

158
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,090
<font color="yellow">I think you've misunderstood.
Our store doesn't buy just any bag--</font>

159
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,000
<font color="yellow">So, are you going to buy it or not?</font>

160
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,590
<font color="yellow">We'll buy it.</font>

161
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,500
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

162
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,400
<font color="yellow">Dong Joo!</font>

163
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,590
<font color="yellow">Do you buy shoes, too?</font>

164
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
<font color="yellow">Wait, not these.</font>

165
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,190
<font color="yellow">I'll just be taking these back, okay?</font>

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,590
<font color="yellow">11,690,000 won! Wow!</font>

167
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,300
<font color="yellow">Are you checking the serial
numbers on the bills?</font>

168
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah, just in case.</font>

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,090
<font color="yellow">Want to get smacked by a wad of cash?</font>

170
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,000
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah. What do you want to eat?
I'll buy you something yummy.</font>

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,090
<font color="yellow">- It's fine.
- Why?</font>

173
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,500
<font color="yellow">Do one of your girlfriends
want to meet up?</font>

174
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

175
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,690
<font color="yellow">Oh well, then. You have
to make a living, too.</font>

176
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,000
<font color="yellow">Drop me off at that intersection.</font>

177
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,690
<font color="yellow">Call me.</font>

178
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

179
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,690
<font color="yellow">Is it really okay for me to call you?</font>

180
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,090
<font color="yellow">You crazy... what, were you
planning to cut ties with me?</font>

181
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
<font color="yellow">Are you by yourself?</font>

182
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

183
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,000
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon.
The microwave.</font>

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

185
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,090
<font color="yellow">Wear these to your next interview.</font>

186
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,690
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth,
your old shoes really don't cut it.</font>

187
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,190
<font color="yellow">You probably failed the interview
portion because of your shoes.</font>

188
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,900
<font color="yellow">I know it might be funny
hearing this from me</font>

189
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,300
<font color="yellow">but there are tons of other
jobs left to apply to.</font>

190
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it'll work out great next time.</font>

191
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,090
<font color="yellow">Do you think that I failed
because of my shoes?</font>

192
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,690
<font color="yellow">I told you, yes! Don't you know
how important those things are?</font>

193
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:59,090
<font color="yellow">There's a girl in my major
who got into that company.</font>

194
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,400
<font color="yellow">Her financial situation
is the same as mine.</font>

195
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,000
<font color="yellow">No. If anything, she's worse off.</font>

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,800
<font color="yellow">She helps pay for her family's living
expenses with her part-time jobs, too.</font>

197
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,690
<font color="yellow">I don't remember, but I don't think
her shoes were better than mine.</font>

198
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,000
<font color="yellow">So in the end...</font>

199
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,400
<font color="yellow">It was all my fault.</font>

200
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,000
<font color="yellow">It wasn't due to her
parents' financial power</font>

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,190
<font color="yellow">or her qualifications.
Or her connections.</font>

202
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,900
<font color="yellow">All I need to do is be a bit better.</font>

203
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,690
<font color="yellow">But the problem is... I don't know
how I can improve myself.</font>

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,190
<font color="yellow">But still, take these. I'm giving these
to you because I'm thankful to you.</font>

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,400
<font color="yellow">Why would you be thankful toward me?</font>

206
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,400
<font color="yellow">There's reasons.
I have my reasons, so take them.</font>

207
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

208
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,800
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it on purpose.</font>

209
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,400
<font color="yellow">Hell?</font>

210
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,590
<font color="yellow">You only do nice things things
for Senior Yoon.</font>

211
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,000
<font color="yellow">Those shoes aren't even your size!</font>

212
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,190
<font color="yellow">I can make them fit, if I tried!</font>

213
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,590
<font color="yellow">I had a bad dream.</font>

214
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,590
<font color="yellow">In my dream, I was sent to hell.</font>

215
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,690
<font color="yellow">How is it that even your
dreams are so you?</font>

216
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,500
<font color="yellow">When I get stressed, I always dream
about taking the College Exams.</font>

217
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,300
<font color="yellow">In my dream, I always say,
"that's weird, I'm already in college!"</font>

218
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,400
<font color="yellow">But I still keep taking the exam anyway.</font>

219
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,000
<font color="yellow">Is that the kind of dream
that college students have?</font>

220
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,800
<font color="yellow">Guys say that they usually dream
about going back to the army.</font>

221
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,900
<font color="yellow">Do you have dreams of taking
the College Exams, too?</font>

222
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,300
<font color="yellow">I have dreams of being chased by a dog.</font>

223
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,090
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

224
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,190
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

225
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,300
<font color="yellow">Shoo!</font>

226
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,500
<font color="yellow">Were you scared?
It's okay. It's okay.</font>

227
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,590
<font color="yellow">You said that your dad rescues you.
So why is that a nightmare?</font>

228
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,390
<font color="yellow">That's a happy ending, then, isn't it?</font>

229
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,590
<font color="yellow">That's true, but...</font>

230
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,300
<font color="yellow">Attention!
Everyone, your attention please.</font>

231
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,090
<font color="yellow">As you all may be aware,
I'm a reporter for the school newspaper.</font>

232
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,300
<font color="yellow">Also, my motto is, "Keeping silent
is the worst type of lying!"</font>

233
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
<font color="yellow">I could just blow past it
as if nothing happened</font>

234
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,300
<font color="yellow">but for the sake of righteousness,
as well as my peace of mind--</font>

235
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,090
<font color="yellow">- Give us the short version.
- What is it?</font>

236
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,590
<font color="yellow">Um, about that.
About how I--</font>

237
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,090
<font color="yellow">Who the hell is it,
at this time of night?</font>

238
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,300
<font color="yellow">Mom?</font>

239
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,500
<font color="yellow">Eun Jae!</font>

240
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,390
<font color="yellow">Mom, what's going on?</font>

241
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,700
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

242
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,740
<font color="yellow">What do I do, when we live together?</font>

243
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,390
<font color="yellow">Sheesh!</font>

244
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,700
<font color="yellow">How could they do this to me?</font>

245
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,090
<font color="yellow">They didn't lay a hand on me,
but this was definitely assault!</font>

246
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,200
<font color="yellow">Assault and battery!</font>

247
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,800
<font color="yellow">So? What did Mister say?</font>

248
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,590
<font color="yellow">"Ms. Jung Hui. Is there anything
that you haven't told me?"</font>

249
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,590
<font color="yellow">How could he say that to me?</font>

250
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,200
<font color="yellow">Was that all?</font>

251
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,390
<font color="yellow">You should've seen the look
on his face when he said that!</font>

252
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:59,000
<font color="yellow">He said that as if I had a huge secret,
and his eyes were full of doubt!</font>

253
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,090
<font color="yellow">He thinks that I'm someone
who killed her husband!</font>

254
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,500
<font color="yellow">How could anyone think that of me?
Huh? How could they?</font>

255
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that he didn't
mean it like that.</font>

256
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,890
<font color="yellow">He just asked you a question, is all.</font>

257
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,000
<font color="yellow">Why would he ask me that? Why?</font>

258
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,700
<font color="yellow">How could I live with him while
being doubted like that? I can't!</font>

259
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,500
<font color="yellow">I can't live with him
for one more second!</font>

260
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,200
<font color="yellow">She seems more like a child
than Eun Jae, right?</font>

261
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,090
<font color="yellow">Maybe because she's young at heart?</font>

262
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,000
<font color="yellow">I mean, she had amazing skin.</font>

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,090
<font color="yellow">Is that the only thing you noticed?</font>

264
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,090
<font color="yellow">Is your mom okay?</font>

265
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,090
<font color="yellow">Something unpleasant happened
between her and my stepdad, I think.</font>

266
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,500
<font color="yellow">Your mom was just like a young girl.</font>

267
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,200
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. I knew that Eun Jae's mom
reminded me of someone.</font>

268
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,300
<font color="yellow">Me? How?</font>

269
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,090
<font color="yellow">- She's not like me at all!
- Why are you saying that?</font>

270
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,300
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down on
Eun Jae's mom, right now?</font>

271
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,500
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

272
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,390
<font color="yellow">I think my mom will have
to stay the night here.</font>

273
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, so?</font>

274
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,000
<font color="yellow">- But Senior Yoon...
- What about her?</font>

275
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,800
<font color="yellow">You want to use my room?</font>

276
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,890
<font color="yellow">How could the two of you
sleep in one bed?</font>

277
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,000
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
All close and cozy, of course!</font>

278
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
<font color="yellow">I don't really want to sleep
with Senior Yoon, though.</font>

279
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,700
<font color="yellow">Even though you like her
enough to give her shoes?</font>

280
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

281
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,700
<font color="yellow"><i>My mom dropped by all of a sudden,
so I think she'll spend the night here.</i></font>

282
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,090
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry, but could you sleep in
Senior Kang's room tonight?</i></font>

283
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,590
<font color="yellow"><i>Kay.</i></font>

284
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,000
<font color="yellow">Should I move to the other side for her?</font>

285
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,890
<font color="yellow">She'll probably feel cramped.</font>

286
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,390
<font color="yellow">Good mor--</font>

287
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,700
<font color="yellow">- What about your mom?
- She went out.</font>

288
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,590
<font color="yellow">She went out?
Okay.</font>

289
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're all awake already?</font>

290
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,200
<font color="yellow">The flower shop was open already!</font>

291
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,500
<font color="yellow">Isn't it pretty?</font>

292
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

293
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,700
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

- Why?</font>

295
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,700
<font color="yellow">Why?
Sheesh!</font>

296
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,000
<font color="yellow">Why'd you sleep on the couch?</font>

297
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,590

303
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700

306
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,800

job until early in the morning.</font>

308
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,300

311
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,590
<font color="yellow">A piece of certified mail came,
and I left it right there.</font>

312
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,300
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?
Is it not for you?</font>

313
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,000

317
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,700

322
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,000
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm healthy now.</font>

you'll also have to organize inventory</font>

328
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,390

There's a lot of extra work to do.</font>

learning experience.</font>

352
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,200
<font color="yellow">It's not that there's no guys.
It's just that you're not into this.</font>

353
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,590
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I totally am!
I'm definitely going to meet a guy!</font>

354
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,500

of guy you want, then.</font>

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,890

his nose bridge to be a bit high.</font>

wears will look good</font>

00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,800

<font color="yellow">Oh, hey.</font>

375
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.

00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

377
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500

- Yeah.</font>

392
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,000
<font color="yellow">One's for purifying your body,
and one's a backup.</font>

He's way out of line.</font>

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,600
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

441
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,300
<font color="yellow">Why are you quitting?</font>

442
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,990
<font color="yellow">You told me not too long
ago to quit, didn't you?</font>

443
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,390
<font color="yellow">Back then, I...</font>

444
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,490
<font color="yellow">I thought you said that this place
was like the ends of the earth for you.</font>

445
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,200
<font color="yellow">I thought that this place
was your cut-off line.</font>

446
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,490
<font color="yellow">That's right.
This place is my cut-off line.</font>

447
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,300
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm quitting.</font>

448
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,490
<font color="yellow">And if you do quit?</font>

449
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,800
<font color="yellow">Can you get some time off
tomorrow afternoon?</font>

450
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,390
<font color="yellow">I do have some common sense, you know.</font>

451
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,700
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep properly, and it has
you on edge to have me here, right?</font>

452
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

453
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,600
<font color="yellow">But in exchange, I'll make you
tons of delicious things, so eat up!</font>

454
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,490
<font color="yellow">Are you done peeling the onions?
If you are, cut them here.</font>

455
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, ma'am.</font>

456
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:06,100
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're way too slow, Student!
You have to work on the squid after that.</font>

457
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
<font color="yellow">You're doing well, though, Student!</font>

458
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,990
<font color="yellow">- Eun Jae!
- Why are you back so late?</font>

459
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,300
<font color="yellow">You're back?</font>

460
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,300
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up, and--
- Please come in.</font>

461
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,890
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jung Hui!</font>

462
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go home, already.</font>

463
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you even here?</font>

464
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was wrong.</font>

465
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,600
<font color="yellow">What did you do wrong, exactly?</font>

466
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
<font color="yellow">Everything.</font>

467
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,300
<font color="yellow">I hate you.
I hate you!</font>

468
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,300
<font color="yellow">Here. Let me see your face.</font>

469
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,800
<font color="yellow">Did you cry a lot?</font>

470
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

471
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,600
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I bet you really are.</font>

472
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,300
<font color="yellow">Man, I thought something
crazier would happen.</font>

473
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,700
<font color="yellow">Wow, I'm so jealous!</font>

474
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,390
<font color="yellow">The entire house is a mess!</font>

475
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,890
<font color="yellow">It's all your fault.</font>

476
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,990
<font color="yellow">No, it's not my fault
that you got all fussy.</font>

477
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,200
<font color="yellow">Idiot! Idiot!
Stupid idiot!</font>

478
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,800
<font color="yellow">Did you send your parents off well?</font>

479
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

480
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,990
<font color="yellow">What? It was romantic.</font>

481
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,490
<font color="yellow">Do you really mean that?</font>

482
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,300
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is good.</font>

483
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, Senior Yoon!
You're back?</font>

484
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,600
<font color="yellow">You don't have your part-time job today?</font>

485
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,990
<font color="yellow">I took the day off.</font>

486
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,600
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

487
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,700
<font color="yellow">It's a long story, but here.
Come and sit.</font>

488
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,300
<font color="yellow">What's all that?</font>

489
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,200
<font color="yellow">I bought some fish cakes
and ddukbokki.</font>

490
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
<font color="yellow">I bought some so we
could eat it together, but...</font>

491
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,490
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

492
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,490
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?
- Did something happen?</font>

493
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,100
<font color="yellow">No, it's just that I feel like I've
been kind of a downer lately.</font>

494
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,600
<font color="yellow">I guess I bought this for nothing.</font>

495
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,490
<font color="yellow">Whoa, whoa, no!
What are you doing?</font>

496
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,200
<font color="yellow">This ddukbokki isn't just
regular ddukbokki!</font>

497
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,300
<font color="yellow">And these fish cakes aren't
just regular fish cakes, either!</font>

498
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,990
<font color="yellow">These are ones that Senior Yoon bought!
Yes, that's right! Senior Yoon did!</font>

499
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,300
<font color="yellow">Wow! Move that crap aside!
Forget about that garbage food!</font>

500
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,800
<font color="yellow">Wow! This is insane.</font>

501
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,700
<font color="yellow">What a relief. I was worried because
you seemed down lately, Senior Yoon.</font>

502
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,890
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I felt so bad,
that I thought I'd die!</font>

503
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,300
<font color="yellow">Why would you?</font>

504
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,390
<font color="yellow">We helped get your hopes
so high for nothing!</font>

505
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,300
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm sure you must've had
even higher hopes than we did, too.</font>

506
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,300
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

507
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,700
<font color="yellow">I just believed that I'd get hired,
because I wanted to.</font>

508
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,100
<font color="yellow">Because I wouldn't be
able to bear it otherwise.</font>

509
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,390
<font color="yellow">All right, let's all have a drink!
We have beer that we bought, right?</font>

510
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,990
<font color="yellow">Yep!</font>

511
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,390
<font color="yellow">All right. For Senior Yoon,
who's now reborn! Yeah!</font>

512
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,700
<font color="yellow">- Yeah!
- Yeah!</font>

513
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,300
<font color="yellow">Wow, I can't believe that I'm eating
food that Senior Yoon bought me!</font>

514
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,990
<font color="yellow">Wow, my life is pretty
much complete now!</font>

515
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,200
<font color="yellow">Hurry over here!</font>

516
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,700
<font color="yellow">Come here!
Hurry! Let's go!</font>

517
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,100
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

518
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,490
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

519
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,700
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh,
I thought you were a ghost!</font>

520
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
You should be sleeping!</font>

521
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,490
<font color="yellow">I was just thinking about
a couple of things.</font>

522
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,990
<font color="yellow">Oh man. You scared the crap out of me.</font>

523
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,800
<font color="yellow">You know, about the ghost
that you said was here...</font>

524
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,100
<font color="yellow">It's my little brother.</font>

525
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,300
<font color="yellow">He hasn't been able to live
or die for six years now.</font>

526
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,800
<font color="yellow">He can't even move.</font>

527
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that must really be terrible.</font>

528
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,490
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

529
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,890
<font color="yellow">Oh my... geez.</font>

530
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,490
<font color="yellow">- What is it now?
- Tell me that it's my fault.</font>

531
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,100
<font color="yellow">It's your fault. I don't know
what it is, but it's all your fault.</font>

532
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,300
<font color="yellow">The fact that it's hot today
is all your fault, too.</font>

533
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,990
<font color="yellow">No, no, no. I'm sure they all just
have a ghost that they want to see.</font>

534
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,990
<font color="yellow">There's a ghost that they've
all had in their hearts, is all!</font>

535
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,490
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

536
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,300
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon is acting weird.</font>

537
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,300
<font color="yellow"><i>About the ghost that
you said was here...</i></font>

538
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,390
<font color="yellow">It's my younger brother.</font>

539
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:01,390
<font color="yellow">- She was up in the middle of the night.
- Let go before you continue talking!</font>

540
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:06,890
<font color="yellow">He hasn't been able to
live or die for six years now.</font>

541
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,100
<font color="yellow">And he can't even move.</font>

542
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,890
<font color="yellow">Okay, so he was like that for six years.
Whatever. Why bring that up now?</font>

543
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,100
<font color="yellow">Your account is expiring in a month.
But you want to close it down now?</font>

544
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,390
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

545
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,890
<font color="yellow">Thanks. See, I told you.
If there's a will, there's a way.</font>

546
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,890
<font color="yellow">- We're all done here, right?
- All right.</font>

547
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,990
<font color="yellow">8,900,000 won.
It's all here.</font>

548
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,300
<font color="yellow">What happened? Did you
win the lottery, or something?</font>

549
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,800
<font color="yellow">- Sir, he didn't give us the IOU.
- What?</font>

550
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,100
<font color="yellow">The IOU.</font>

551
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,490
<font color="yellow">Hey, I have hemorrhoids!
It you make them worse, I swear--</font>

552
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,800
<font color="yellow">- What was with that look in her eyes?
- What look?</font>

553
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,300
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sure that must be terrible.</i></font>

554
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,300
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

555
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,390
<font color="yellow">Hey. If you don't let go by the time
I count to three, I'll kill you!</font>

556
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,490
<font color="yellow">One, two, three--</font>

557
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,890
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.
Of course it's nothing.</font>

558
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,600
<font color="yellow">It'd be bad if it weren't.</font>

559
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,100
<font color="yellow">Should I just kill her?</font>

560
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,990
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

561
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:49,490
<font color="yellow">I wanted to meet up with you and have
coffee, and spend time talking to you.</font>

562
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:50,990
<font color="yellow">Just like everyone else does.</font>

563
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,490
<font color="yellow">That's okay, right?</font>

564
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,800
<font color="yellow">I want ice cream.
What about you?</font>

565
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,700
<font color="yellow">I'll have ice cream, too.</font>

566
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,390
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.
We'd like to order.</font>

567
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,600
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jin Myung.
How does this look?</font>

568
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,600
<font color="yellow">I don't think it suits you.</font>

569
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,990
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

570
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,490
<font color="yellow">You pick one out too, Ms. Jin Myung.</font>

571
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,100
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.
Let's go.</font>

572
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,990
<font color="yellow">What should we do next?</font>

573
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,800
<font color="yellow">- Let's go see a movie.
- A movie?</font>

574
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,390
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Mom? What now?</font>

575
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,390
<font color="yellow"><i>"What now?"
What kind of greeting is that?</i></font>

576
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,490
<font color="yellow">- Everything's okay, right?
<i>- Pretty much.</i></font>

577
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,390
<font color="yellow"><i>I just felt bad that I couldn't
properly say goodbye to everyone.</i></font>

578
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Tell your seniors that
I'm sorry about that!</i></font>

579
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,300
<font color="yellow">- All right.
<i>- Especially to that scary one.</i></font>

580
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,600
<font color="yellow"><i>The one who got a letter
for Yoon Soo Myung.</i></font>

581
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,700
<font color="yellow">Yoon Soo Myung?</font>

582
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,990
<font color="yellow"><i>Make sure you get along with everyone</i></font>

583
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,600
<font color="yellow"><i>and bring them over to our

had to leave, all of a sudden.</font>
