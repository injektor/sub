<font color="yellow"><i>He'd been supporting his wife and child
who lived overseas for five years</i></font>

46

<font color="yellow">Can I buy you a drink?</font>

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, and this guy is just a friend.</i></font>

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,500
<font color="yellow"><i>He works in the same industry as I do,
so he's kind of like a coworker.</i></font>

51

<font color="yellow">Wow, what a nice view!</font>

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,900
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm a fake lover for these men.</i></font>

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,500
<font color="yellow"><i>All of us involved know
that this is a fake relationship.</i></font>

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,090
<font color="yellow"><i>One way to put it is that I've been
hired to play a certain role by each man.</i></font>

55
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,800
<font color="yellow"><i>And what I get in exchange
is spending money.</i></font>

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,900
<font color="yellow">- That was such a good shot!
- What are you talking about?</font>

57
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,800
<font color="yellow">Just wait until you get to my age.
This kind of shot can be considered good!</font>

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,590
<font color="yellow"><i>There's no way. It's clearly
a give-and-take situation.</i></font>

59
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,400
<font color="yellow">She's basically accepting money for sex.
In other words, she's a prostitute.</font>

60
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,800
<font color="yellow"><i>That's right.
I'm a prostitute.</i></font>

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,900
<font color="yellow">Prostitute...</font>

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
<font color="yellow"><i>It's something I
was definitely aware of</i></font>

63
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,900
<font color="yellow"><i>but it really hits home
to hear it said by someone else.</i></font>

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,190
<font color="yellow"><i>This is where I find my lovers.</i></font>

65
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Three is a good number, but...</i></font>

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Spending three million won is too much.</i></font>

67
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,800
<font color="yellow">Let's limit it to two million
a month, all right?</font>

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
<font color="yellow">It's getting hard on me.</font>

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,190
<font color="yellow"><i>But this guy keeps
bringing up money.</i></font>

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,800
<font color="yellow">It's time for me to move on
to someone else.</font>

71
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,500
<font color="yellow"><i>I have certain criteria that must be
met when I accept new lovers.</i></font>

72
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,690
<font color="yellow">- Oh, you're here?
- Yes. Here.</font>

73
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,500
<font color="yellow"><i>He's way too old for me.</i></font>

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Work is work, but one must
take a bit of pleasure in their work.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[1.2 million won]

79
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh no, he's dangerous.</i></font>

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,000
<font color="yellow"><i>I dated a guy like him once
when I was naive.</i></font>

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,190
<font color="yellow"><i>In some ways, a lot of what we get
paid is hazard pay, in my line of work.</i></font>

82
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,500
<font color="yellow"><i>When you share a bed with a man
you don't know, anything can happen.</i></font>

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
<font color="yellow"><i>But what's most important is a man's
"economic prowess," per se.</i></font>

89
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,890
<font color="yellow"><i>There will always be issues with guys</i></font>

90
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,190
<font color="yellow"><i>who have to save money
to give you an allowance.</i></font>

91
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,800
<font color="yellow"><i>And there's living proof right there.</i></font>

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,690
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much that costs?</font>

93
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,390
<font color="yellow">200,000 won!</font>

94
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,800
<font color="yellow"><i>The Madame of this establishment
met a man seven years ago.</i></font>

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,440
<font color="yellow"><i>The man gave her a gift
every time she saw him.</i></font>

96
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,190
<font color="yellow"><i>A necklace. A bag.
Cosmetics.</i></font>

97
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,800
<font color="yellow"><i>And then, the cops came to look for her.</i></font>

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,100
<font color="yellow"><i>The man was a banker, and he'd
been embezzling his customers' money.</i></font>

99
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,500
<font color="yellow"><i>When he got out of jail after
a year and two months</i></font>

100
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,890
<font color="yellow"><i>he didn't have a job or a family left.</i></font>

101
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,390
<font color="yellow">Would you like to order something, sir?</font>

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Anything's fine.
Something like whiskey.</font>

103
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,000
<font color="yellow">Would you like it neat, or on the rocks?</font>

104
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,800
<font color="yellow">Anything's fine.</font>

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you neat, then.</font>

106
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,190
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't always snag myself a lover on
the same day I find myself needing one.</i></font>

107
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,890
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sure it's like that for everyone.</i></font>

108
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,100
<font color="yellow">Really? Oh my gosh.</font>

109
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,300
<font color="yellow">You know, Senior Kang is also lying
about the fact that she's in college.</font>

110
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,800
<font color="yellow">I asked someone in her major's school
newspaper to look into it for me.</font>

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
<font color="yellow">They told me that there isn't a
girl named Kang Yi Na in that major.</font>

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,300
<font color="yellow">How could she do that?
What's even real about her, then?</font>

113
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,100
<font color="yellow">I wonder if her name is
actually even Kang Yi Na?</font>

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,890
<font color="yellow">You know, there was a movie like this.</font>

115
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,500
<font color="yellow">You know, that girl who
lied about everything.</font>

116
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,890
<font color="yellow">- "Helpless!"
- Yeah, that's right!</font>

117
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,100
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, I have goosebumps.</font>

118
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,000
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which...</font>

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,500
<font color="yellow">when she gets back she looks different
from when she left.</font>

120
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

121
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,690
<font color="yellow">Um... her makeup,
and her overall feel.</font>

122
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,600
<font color="yellow">Why? What was her makeup like?</font>

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,690
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

124
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,800
<font color="yellow">I'm heading out!</font>

125
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm home!</i></font>

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,190
<font color="yellow">- I'm not sure.
- What the hell?</font>

127
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,000
<font color="yellow">Figures. She didn't even know Piketty
when she's supposedly a Business major.</font>

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,190
<font color="yellow">What's "Piketty?"</font>

129
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,600
<font color="yellow">You know, Thomas Piketty.
The economist.</font>

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, how is a Nutrition major like me
supposed to know an economist?</font>

131
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
<font color="yellow">You don't know them either, right?</font>

132
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
<font color="yellow">"Capital in the Twenty-First Century."</font>

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,700
<font color="yellow">You're such an idiot.
You're a fake too, aren't you?</font>

134
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,100
<font color="yellow">If she's not a student,
she's not doing this for tuition</font>

135
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,700
<font color="yellow">and it doesn't seem like she's
sending money to her family, either.</font>

136
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,290
<font color="yellow">So why is she doing this, then?</font>

137
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,890
<font color="yellow">Probably to live an easier life.</font>

138
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,500
<font color="yellow">Well, yeah.
Figures.</font>

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,790
<font color="yellow">I hear that there's a lot of college
students doing that, nowadays.</font>

140
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,600
<font color="yellow">People who accept money
for being someone's lover.</font>

141
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,700
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Oh my.
What is wrong with this world?</font>

142
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,890
<font color="yellow">I sounded like a middle-aged
woman just now, didn't I?</font>

143
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised over nothing?</font>

144
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,890
<font color="yellow">You little--</font>

145
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,600
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon!</font>

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,790
<font color="yellow">You know, apparently Senior
Kang isn't a college student!</font>

147
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,200
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

148
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,600
<font color="yellow">Song asked her friend</font>

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,890
<font color="yellow">and they said that there's nobody
by that name in that major.</font>

150
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,000
<font color="yellow">Isn't that ridiculous?</font>

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,890
<font color="yellow">How could she do that to us?</font>

152
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,890
<font color="yellow">Huh? Why isn't she saying anything?</font>

153
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,790
<font color="yellow">It's because she has a poker face.
I'm sure she's surprised, too.</font>

154
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,890
<font color="yellow">She should save her poker face
for when she's playing poker!</font>

155
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,600
<font color="yellow">Why does she have to go
and use it all the time?</font>

156
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,890
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
What's up?</font>

157
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,790
<font color="yellow">Do souls have colors, too?</font>

158
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,290
<font color="yellow">You said that you knew Senior Kang was
lying because of the color of her aura.</font>

159
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,390
<font color="yellow">That's right!
Do ghosts have colors, too?</font>

160
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
<font color="yellow">What color is it?</font>

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,390
<font color="yellow">Grey.</font>

162
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,500
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,290
<font color="yellow">It's depressed, and sad.</font>

164
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,890
<font color="yellow">That's the feeling I get from it.</font>

165
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,200
<font color="yellow">Why? Why is it sad and depressed?</font>

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,500
<font color="yellow">Beats me.</font>

167
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon!</font>

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,200
<font color="yellow">Does the spirit hear all of
the things that we say?</font>

169
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

170
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,390
<font color="yellow">Did something happen at this house
a long time ago?</font>

171
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,000
<font color="yellow">For example, did someone die here?</font>

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,790
<font color="yellow">Or... did they get murdered?</font>

173
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,200
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

174
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
<font color="yellow">What could it be, then?</font>

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,100
<font color="yellow">I guess it followed you here, Eun Jae.</font>

176
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,700
<font color="yellow">Right? I mean, it apparently only
appeared here not too long ago.</font>

177
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,200
<font color="yellow">And it was after you came here.</font>

178
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,500
<font color="yellow">Do you know anyone who's dead now?</font>

179
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,600
<font color="yellow">It might be someone who's not dead yet.</font>

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,390
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
You only become a ghost if you're dead.</font>

181
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,790
<font color="yellow">What about a brain-dead person?</font>

182
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,100
<font color="yellow">Where do the souls of
brain-dead people go?</font>

183
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,100
<font color="yellow">Song.
Are you sleeping?</font>

184
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,200
<font color="yellow">Nope.</font>

185
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,600
<font color="yellow">You feel uneasy, right?</font>

186
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- I'm talking about Senior Kang.</font>

187
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,890
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she sleeps with
tons of different guys.</font>

188
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,700
<font color="yellow">If she gets some sort of STD...
some of them are contagious.</font>

189
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,200
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that's true.</font>

190
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,890
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

191
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,200
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

192
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

193
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,700
<font color="yellow">Why do you come here, Mister?</font>

194
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,700
<font color="yellow">You don't like you're used
to places like these.</font>

195
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's true.</font>

196
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,500
<font color="yellow">A place like this
doesn't suit a guy like me.</font>

197
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,700
<font color="yellow">You're similar to me, then.</font>

198
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,000
<font color="yellow">I have a place where I don't
quite fit into right now, too.</font>

199
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,790
<font color="yellow">They treat me like
I have AIDS, or something!</font>

200
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,890
<font color="yellow">It's funny, but it also pisses me off.</font>

201
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,000
<font color="yellow">I'm wondering if I should maybe
just fight with them about it.</font>

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,290
<font color="yellow">It's not like I don't get where
they're coming from, though.</font>

203
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,390
<font color="yellow">But still, it makes me feel like crap!</font>

204
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,790
<font color="yellow">But, um...</font>

205
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,000
<font color="yellow">is it all right to tell me
these sorts of things?</font>

206
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,100
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

207
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,290
<font color="yellow">The fact that I have sugar daddies?</font>

208
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,200
<font color="yellow">Well, who cares? It's not
like I'd date you anyway.</font>

209
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, did you want to date me?</font>

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,890
<font color="yellow">Um, no.
No.</font>

211
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,390
<font color="yellow">What, you don't like nasty
little insects like me?</font>

212
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about
yourself like that?</font>

213
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,500
<font color="yellow">Because I get treated like one.</font>

214
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,200
<font color="yellow">So, what are you going to do now?</font>

215
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,600
<font color="yellow">Are you going to move out?</font>

216
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,390
<font color="yellow">I have to move out if they tell me to!</font>

217
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,600
<font color="yellow">But honestly, why do I have to move out?</font>

218
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong?</font>

219
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,500
<font color="yellow">You lied to them.</font>

220
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,890
<font color="yellow">That's all?</font>

221
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,600
<font color="yellow">It's not like they tell the
truth all the time, either!</font>

222
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,100
<font color="yellow">If anything, they're even worse than me!</font>

223
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,790
<font color="yellow">They spend tons of money, saying
they're using it for cram school!</font>

224
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,290
<font color="yellow">They say they're doing
field work with their professor</font>

225
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,790
<font color="yellow">but go on a trip with their lover.</font>

226
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,790
<font color="yellow">And my clothes, my shoes, my makeup...</font>

227
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,500
<font color="yellow">They use my stuff as much as
they want to, and then lie about it!</font>

228
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,790
<font color="yellow">If you put things this way,
I really don't lie that much!</font>

229
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,390
<font color="yellow">I told my customers too,
that I'm not a college student.</font>

230
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,890
<font color="yellow">But the other kids who
do the same work as I do</font>

231
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,700
<font color="yellow">all lie and say they're
college students.</font>

232
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
<font color="yellow">It's easier to make money that way.</font>

233
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
<font color="yellow">If you put things this way,
I really am the paragon of honesty!</font>

234
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're pissing me off.</font>

235
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,000
<font color="yellow">You just laughed at me, didn't you?</font>

236
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

237
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,790
<font color="yellow">You know, I don't lie, if only
because it's such a hassle.</font>

238
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,100
<font color="yellow">Lying is such a hassle.</font>

239
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,200
<font color="yellow">So why did you lie to those girls?</font>

240
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,790
<font color="yellow">Was there a reason you wanted to live
there, even if you had to lie so much?</font>

241
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,700
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

242
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,200
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, Honey!
Where are you right now?</font>

244
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,790
<font color="yellow">Oh, in front of the bank?
I'll come out now. Okay.</font>

245
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,200
<font color="yellow">Can't we eat first?</font>

246
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,700
<font color="yellow">You're hungry?</font>

247
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,000
<font color="yellow">You should've told me sooner!</font>

248
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,790
<font color="yellow">I don't want to do anything
because I'm hungry.</font>

249
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,000
<font color="yellow">I think I'd perform really well
if I had something to eat first.</font>

250
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,090
<font color="yellow">- Damn it.
- Please?</font>

251
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,200
<font color="yellow">We'll be back later.</font>

252
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,500
<font color="yellow">- What do you want to eat?
- Steak!</font>

253
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,500
<font color="yellow">- Here you are.
- Thank you.</font>

254
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,790
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.</font>

255
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,700
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the wine list
and the menu.</font>

256
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,090
<font color="yellow">Did you see the bag that
the girl at Table 7 has?</font>

257
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,290
<font color="yellow">It's from Ortega.
It's a high-end brand.</font>

258
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,290
<font color="yellow">We'd have to work
500 hours to afford it.</font>

259
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,700
<font color="yellow">Damn, it pisses me off.</font>

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,790
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?
You're the one who wanted to eat.</font>

261
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,700
<font color="yellow">Sorry. It's not that good, right?</font>

262
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,500
<font color="yellow">No, it tastes good.</font>

263
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop right there!
Stop right there!</font>

264
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,700
<font color="yellow">- Hey, stop right there!
- Hey, stop right there!</font>

265
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop! Where the hell
are you running to?</font>

266
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,500
<font color="yellow">How dare a whelp like you seduce
another woman's husband?</font>

267
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,200
<font color="yellow">- You enjoy living like that?
- You little slut!</font>

268
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,900
<font color="yellow">- You think your face--
- Stop it.</font>

269
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,790
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop it!</font>

270
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,090
<font color="yellow">- What's it to you?
- If you continue, I'll call the cops.</font>

271
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,920
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you even know
what kind of girl this bitch is?</font>

272
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,090
<font color="yellow">I don't care if she stole your husband.
You're being a nuisance to our business.</font>

273
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,500
<font color="yellow">And stop talking down to me.</font>

274
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,900
<font color="yellow">Why, you little--</font>

275
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,500
<font color="yellow">Why, I ought to--</font>

276
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,000
<font color="yellow">- Damn it.
- Let's just go.</font>

277
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
<font color="yellow">- You're dead next time!
- You little...</font>

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,790
<font color="yellow">Consider yourself lucky today, bitch!</font>

279
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,200
<font color="yellow">Can you move?</font>

280
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,290
<font color="yellow">Then... can you move over?
You're right in front of the door.</font>

281
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,500
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

282
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,000
<font color="yellow">How do you like it?
Do you like it?</font>

283
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

284
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,290
<font color="yellow">Jin Myung!</font>

285
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,590
<font color="yellow">She's the one who'll be using this room.</font>

286
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,700
<font color="yellow">But... she says that she wants
to use this room by herself.</font>

287
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,290
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to her about
the rent and the utilities?</font>

288
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,590
<font color="yellow">Yep.</font>

289
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,290
<font color="yellow">I guess you must come
from a rich family.</font>

290
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,500
<font color="yellow">Um, no.</font>

291
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,700
<font color="yellow">- Are you a student?
- Yes.</font>

292
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,200
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking about?</font>

293
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,790
<font color="yellow">The beginning of the lie.</font>

294
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,200
<font color="yellow">Are you done?
Let's go.</font>

295
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,500
<font color="yellow">We have to get a nice workout,
now that we've eaten.</font>

296
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,200
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

297
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, excuse me! Does this bus go
to Yeonnam-dong, by any chance?</font>

298
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, it does.</font>

299
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,500
<font color="yellow">Um, do you go to the Yeonnam-dong
Community Center, then?</font>

300
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,790
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please, get on.</font>

301
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,090
<font color="yellow">You're slower than you look.</font>

302
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,090
<font color="yellow">How many days have you
been running for the bus, now?</font>

303
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,900
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon!</font>

304
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, should I not call you that anymore?</font>

305
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,500
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

306
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,200
<font color="yellow">Is Sangam-dong where
your part-time job is?</font>

307
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,790
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

308
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, so I was right.</font>

309
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,700
<font color="yellow">I thought it might've been you
when I was having dinner before.</font>

310
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,900
<font color="yellow">You didn't see me?</font>

311
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,090
<font color="yellow">- I did.
- So why didn't you say hi?</font>

312
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,900
<font color="yellow">I can't do that to customers.</font>

313
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,200
<font color="yellow">Oh.
Isn't it hard?</font>

314
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,290
<font color="yellow">It looked like a really hard job.</font>

315
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,090
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it is a hard job.</font>

316
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,700
<font color="yellow">There's an easier way to
live life, you know.</font>

317
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,900
<font color="yellow">Get yourself a boyfriend.
Want me to introduce you to one?</font>

318
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,500
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

319
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,900
<font color="yellow">Figures.</font>

320
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,200
<font color="yellow">With that face and that body...</font>

321
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,500
<font color="yellow">People call me over, saying "student!"
when they're asking for directions.</font>

322
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,700
<font color="yellow">It's because they think that everyone
around my age is a student.</font>

323
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,900
<font color="yellow">But when you tell them that you're not
a student, things get more complicated.</font>

324
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,500
<font color="yellow">"What's your job?
Why don't you go to school?"</font>

325
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,000
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm just trying
to pass as a student.</font>

326
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,590
<font color="yellow">Because it becomes a nuisance otherwise.</font>

327
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,090
<font color="yellow">It's not because I was trying to lie.</font>

328
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,900
<font color="yellow">That's simple enough, right?</font>

329
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,290
<font color="yellow">Did you wait for me to tell me that?</font>

330
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,790
<font color="yellow">I wasn't exactly waiting
for you, per se.</font>

331
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,290
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

332
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,090
<font color="yellow">- Miss, It seemed to me that you--
- Why are you calling me that?</font>

333
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,590
<font color="yellow">It makes you sound so old.</font>

334
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,090
<font color="yellow">What should I call you, then?</font>

335
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,790
<font color="yellow">- To me, it seems that you--
- Why are you referring to me as that?</font>

336
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,000
<font color="yellow">Whatever.
Just call me "Miss."</font>

337
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,900
<font color="yellow">Miss, it seems to me that you
really care about that student.</font>

338
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,700
<font color="yellow">- Who?
- The one who lives a hard life.</font>

339
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,500
<font color="yellow">The one that has tons of part-time jobs.</font>

340
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,900
<font color="yellow">You're saying that I care a lot
about Senior Yoon?</font>

341
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,590
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

342
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,200
<font color="yellow">- Who knows?
- No... no way.</font>

343
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,090
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

344
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,000
<font color="yellow">Why would I care about her?</font>

345
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,790
<font color="yellow">Can I sit here?</font>

346
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,500
<font color="yellow">All right.
Good work.</font>

347
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,000
<font color="yellow">- Yes, thank you!
- Yes.</font>

348
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,700
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- All right.</font>

349

354
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700

355
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,500

356
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,090
<font color="yellow">All right, I've taken a look at your
assignments that you uploaded online.</font>

357
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,900
<font color="yellow">I'll give you feedback on
that individually.</font>

guys who are your type?</font>

over there, so...</font>

366
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,090
<font color="yellow">Senior.
Can I sit here?</font>

367
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,000
<font color="yellow">I'll just eat in silence, I promise!</font>

368
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
<font color="yellow">Why, is something the matter?</font>

369
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:05,090
<font color="yellow">That guy is a senior from my department,
and he keeps on bothering me!</font>

370
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,400
<font color="yellow">He keeps giggling during
class and staring at me</font>

371
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
<font color="yellow">and he keeps talking
about perverted things.</font>

372
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,290
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

373
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,790
<font color="yellow">Do people get bullied in college, too?</font>

374
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

375
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,000
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

376
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,590
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was bullied
a bit in high school...</font>

377
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,790
<font color="yellow">Well, no. More like I had no friends.</font>

378
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:44,200
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to make friends and visit
fun places in college, no matter what...</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
You can keep reading.</font>

380
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,900

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

382
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,200

Which salon did that to you?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Thanks, friend!</i></font>

438
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,500
<font color="yellow"><i>- Okay.
- What does he look like?</i></font>

439
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Is he hot?</i></font>

440
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,590
<font color="yellow"><i>Friend?
Where you at, girl?</i></font>

441
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Come back! It's okay
even if he's ugly! [crying face]</i></font>

442
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
<font color="yellow">Oh ho!</font>

443
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,500
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

444
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,900
<font color="yellow">- Please, have a seat.
- Okay.</font>

445
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,900
<font color="yellow">- You're quite pretty.
- Thank you.</font>

446
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,500
<font color="yellow">You're a lot more handsome
than you were in your photo.</font>

447
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,590
<font color="yellow">You're back?</font>

448
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,300
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

449
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,800
<font color="yellow">What's with you? You look like
you won the lottery!</font>

450
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,000
<font color="yellow">His height, voice, personality, and
butt are all totally my type!</font>

451
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,690
<font color="yellow">- And how did he feel about you?
- I killed it, obviously.</font>

452
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,900
<font color="yellow">A French person put their laundry
in the dryer. What did they say?</font>

453
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,190
<font color="yellow">Marseille! (sounds like Korean
phrase for "please dry!")</font>

454
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,500
<font color="yellow">Our sense of humor are
exactly the same, and...</font>

455
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,690
<font color="yellow">Ew! Did you have alcohol?</font>

456
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,000
<font color="yellow">Oops!</font>

457
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,900
<font color="yellow">Oh my, oh my! You drank
with him on the first date?</font>

458
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,000
<font color="yellow">I almost didn't come home tonight!</font>

459
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,190
<font color="yellow">And so? What happened after the date?</font>

460
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,500
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to take that one.
- Oh, really?</font>

461
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's already here.</font>

462
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,190
<font color="yellow">I had a lot of fun today.
I'll call you!</font>

463
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,690
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Have a safe trip home.</font>

464
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,900
<font color="yellow">Call... call me!</font>

465
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,000
<font color="yellow">Bye!
Bye, now!</font>

466
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,800
<font color="yellow">Have a safe trip home!</font>

467
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, wow.</font>

468
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:29,300
<font color="yellow"><i>A powder-pink skirt
blows in the spring wind...</i></font>

469
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,000
<font color="yellow">She's totally lost it!</font>

470
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,590
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

471
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,500
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you doing, Honey? Hehe.</i></font>

472
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,690
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what is he doing?</font>

473
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,000
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

474
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,900
<font color="yellow">I just got a text from my friend.</font>

475
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,500
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

476
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,900
<font color="yellow"><i>[He said that you're a really fun, nice
person, but he just wants to be friends.]</i></font>

477
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,500
<font color="yellow">Apparently, he can't see me as a woman.</font>

478
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,090
<font color="yellow">Why is that? Do I lack female hormones?</font>

479
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,800
<font color="yellow">Should I go get estrogen shots?</font>

480
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,000
<font color="yellow">What if I have XXY syndrome?</font>

481
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
<font color="yellow">My neck seems to be
getting thicker these days.</font>

482
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,300
<font color="yellow">Here, look! Do I look like
I have an Adam's apple?</font>

483
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,800
<font color="yellow">You did impersonations when
you went on your date, right?</font>

484
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,300
<font color="yellow">Did you do this, too?</font>

485
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,800
<font color="yellow">- You did, didn't you?
- But he thought it was funny.</font>

486
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,500
<font color="yellow">And we had such great conversations.</font>

487
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,190
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

488
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,590
<font color="yellow">How much did you talk, compared to him?</font>

489
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,090
<font color="yellow">Did he talk as much as you did?</font>

490
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,190
<font color="yellow">Okay, then did you talk
60 percent of the time?</font>

491
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,900
<font color="yellow">You talked 70 percent of the time?</font>

492
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,500
<font color="yellow">To be precise, I talked about
75 percent of the time.</font>

493
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,090
<font color="yellow">That's not a conversation!
That's a lecture!</font>

494
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,800
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I had to keep the conversation
flowing! What else was I supposed to do?</font>

495
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,690
<font color="yellow">It gets so awkward
when nobody's talking!</font>

496
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,300
<font color="yellow">Damn it, I don't know how
others can stand it.</font>

497
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,900
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

498
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,090
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he texting me?</font>

499
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,800
<font color="yellow">It's not like he's that busy,
since he's a student!</font>

500
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even study!</font>

501
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,900
<font color="yellow">He has time to hang out with friends,
but no time to text me back? I get it.</font>

502
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,800
<font color="yellow">Do you know which
number I hate the most?</font>

503
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,900
<font color="yellow">One! That damned one, that tells
me that he didn't read my message!</font>

504
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,090
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You damned bastard.</font>

505
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,190
<font color="yellow">Did his freaking finger break?
Why isn't he contacting me?</font>

506
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,500
<font color="yellow">"He used to ask, every
breakfast, lunch, and dinner..."</font>

507
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,000
<font color="yellow">'Did you eat? What did you eat?
Did you make sure to chew well?'</font>

508
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,300
<font color="yellow">"He texted me so damn much when he was
following me around, saying he liked me!"</font>

509
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,800
<font color="yellow">"But his passion has cooled.
He got himself another girl!"</font>

510
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,190
<font color="yellow">When will I ever get to say such things?</font>

511
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,900
<font color="yellow">It's because you don't know.</font>

512
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,190
<font color="yellow">People feel the loneliest when
you're with tons of other people</font>

513
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,690
<font color="yellow">and people feel poorest when
you're around someone who's rich.</font>

514
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,300
<font color="yellow">I feel lonely,
even though I have a lover--</font>

515
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,400
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm in front of Hongdae.
Want to come?</i></font>

516
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Never mind. Everyone pretty much feels
done. Let's see each other next time.</i></font>

517
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:04,690
<font color="yellow"><i>What the hell? Being wishy-washy
as you please... you're so annoying!</i></font>

518
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,090
<font color="yellow"><i>That's good.
I was tired anyway.</i></font>

519
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,900
<font color="yellow">What the hell, am I
supposed to be on standby?</font>

520
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
<font color="yellow">Do I have to run out if you tell me
to come at the middle of the night?</font>

521
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,090
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do that,
take your credit card back.</font>

522
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,690
<font color="yellow">I won't use it.</font>

523
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,800
<font color="yellow">I don't care!
That's your problem!</font>

524
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,190
<font color="yellow">I can't go out.
I won't go out!</font>

525
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,690
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up.
I can't chat for long.</font>

526
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,300
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sleep, so don't contact me.</font>

527
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,500
<font color="yellow">I hung up, didn't I?</font>

528
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,090
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything!</font>

529
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
<font color="yellow">Weren't you heading out?</font>

530
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,500
<font color="yellow">This is my cup!</font>

531
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,690
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

532
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,500
<font color="yellow">You think "sorry" is going to fix it?
How disgusting.</font>

533
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

534
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,800
<font color="yellow">Who knows what you did with that mouth?</font>

535
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,190
<font color="yellow">You think that my mouth is disgusting?</font>

536
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it is!</font>

537
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you put that mouth
on tons of nasty things!</font>

538
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

539
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,090
<font color="yellow">Make sure you examine your
mouth constantly, to see if it rots off.</font>

540
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,590
<font color="yellow">You crazy bitch!</font>

541
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:33,500
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you,
you trashy bitch!</font>

542
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,000
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

543
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,000
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

544
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,090
<font color="yellow">She kissed you?</font>

545
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,090
<font color="yellow">She's such a crazy bitch.</font>

546
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,590
<font color="yellow">- Did she use tongue?
- Honey!</font>

547
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,190
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay, okay.
Stop crying, already.</font>

548
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,800
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

549
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,500
<font color="yellow">You want me to go over there
and yell at her?</font>

550
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,000
<font color="yellow">It's fine.
I'll do it myself.</font>

551
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,500
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make her pay!</font>

552
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,000
<font color="yellow">I was about to kill her,
but stopped myself just in time.</font>

553
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,190
<font color="yellow">It's not like she's the freaking
Virgin Mary, either.</font>

554
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,800
<font color="yellow">She's sexually active too,
but treats me like scum!</font>

555
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,300
<font color="yellow">Oh. You know, she's hated
me from the very start.</font>

556
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,190
<font color="yellow">She calls me "senior" to my face, but
she's thinking shitty things about me.</font>

557
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,500
<font color="yellow">And she thinks I wouldn't know.</font>

558
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,800
<font color="yellow">What? Do you think
I'm a crazy bitch, too?</font>

559
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,800
<font color="yellow">You got scratched right there.</font>

560
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,000
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

561
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,800
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

562
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,300
<font color="yellow">All you need to move here is yourself.</font>

563
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,800
<font color="yellow">Who used to live here?</font>

564
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,300
<font color="yellow">Don't misunderstand. I used to
come here to hang out with my friends...</font>

565
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,800
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you want replaced.
I'll replace anything you want.</font>

566
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,500
<font color="yellow">The view is nice, too.</font>

567
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,300
<font color="yellow">And you can drink wine here, too.</font>

568
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,500
<font color="yellow">And we can play here at any time.</font>

569
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,800
<font color="yellow">It's kind of annoying that we have to
worry about being seen sometimes.</font>

570
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,000
<font color="yellow">You don't pick up my calls sometimes.</font>

571
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,190
<font color="yellow">And there's too many instances
when I couldn't get in touch with you.</font>

572
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,400
<font color="yellow">You'll move in here, right?</font>

573
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,190
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

574
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,800
<font color="yellow">What's there to think about?</font>

575
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,090
<font color="yellow">We can live here together, with matching
cups, pillows, and pajamas.</font>

576
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,300
<font color="yellow">How about it?
We'll be just like newlyweds.</font>

577
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,900
<font color="yellow">But it'll all be a lie.</font>

578
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,690
<font color="yellow">We can just pretend
that it's all real, in our hearts.</font>

579
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,000
<font color="yellow"><i>There's an easy way to live life, too.</i></font>

580
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,500
<font color="yellow">Get yourself a boyfriend.
Want me to introduce you to one?</font>

581
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,300
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

582
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:29,000
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

583
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,000
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

584
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,800
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sit here.</font>

585
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,500
<font color="yellow">- We're still clearing that table, so...
- I'll wait, then.</font>

586
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,800
<font color="yellow">Why? That table is fine.</font>

587
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,090
<font color="yellow">I want to sit over there, though.</font>

588
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,400
<font color="yellow">- We'll wait, then.
- Yes, sir. Please come this way.</font>

589
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,000
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- What? Oh, sure.</font>

590
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,000
<font color="yellow">I'll take your orders.</font>

591
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,900
<font color="yellow">Is it really okay if I buy
a new bed and sofa?</font>

592
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,800
<font color="yellow">Sure. I don't mind.</font>

593
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,690
<font color="yellow">How much am I allowed to spend on them?</font>

594
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know.</font>

595
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,300
<font color="yellow">- Maybe two million won?
- Two million?</font>

596
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,190
<font color="yellow">Hey, there.
I'm back.</font>

597
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,800
<font color="yellow">Do you know her?</font>

598
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,500
<font color="yellow">Is she a friend?</font>

599
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,400
<font color="yellow">No, as if.
She's my housemate.</font>

600
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,090
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

601
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,900
<font color="yellow">She said that she can't
act as if she knows me.</font>

602
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,500
<font color="yellow">Just pretend that you don't know her.</font>

603
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,300
<font color="yellow">Just leave her a tip, okay?</font>

604
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:22,000
<font color="yellow">Here, have some.
It's good.</font>

605
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,900
<font color="yellow">It's good, right?</font>

606
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,900
<font color="yellow">It's so good.
And not greasy at all.</font>

607
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,800
<font color="yellow">We enjoyed the meal.</font>

608
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,800
<font color="yellow">You're not busy right now, right?
Help me out a bit.</font>

609
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,090
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

610
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,300
<font color="yellow">Take a seat right there.</font>

611
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,800
<font color="yellow">Eat it.</font>

612
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,900
<font color="yellow">Eating sweets helps when
you feel worn out.</font>

613
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,090
<font color="yellow">Did I seem that worn out to you, sir?</font>

614
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,300
<font color="yellow">Why are you worn out so early today?</font>

615
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,300
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I don't know
why I feel so worn out.</font>

616
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,000
<font color="yellow">It's only 9 p.m., after all.</font>

617
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,800
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be so worn out already.</font>

618
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,500
<font color="yellow">But, how did you know?</font>

619
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,590
<font color="yellow">That I was worn out, I mean.</font>

620
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,800
<font color="yellow">You come to know people's
quirks when you like them.</font>

621
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,500
<font color="yellow">How does it taste?
It's good, right?</font>

622
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,690
<font color="yellow">I made them not too long ago.</font>

623
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,400
<font color="yellow">Wow, you know how to joke
around too, Ms. Jin Myung?</font>

624
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,800
<font color="yellow">I'm being honest, though.</font>

625
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,190
<font color="yellow">The custard cream is too burnt.</font>

626
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,800
<font color="yellow">And the pastry isn't crispy at all.</font>

627
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,300
<font color="yellow">Eat up, and come back
after you get some rest.</font>

628
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

629
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,800
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.
Just a moment.</font>

630
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,300
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

631
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,000
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

632
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,300
<font color="yellow">You said that you have
one semester left, right?</font>

633
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,590
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

634
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,900
<font color="yellow">You'll be done suffering soon, then.</font>

635
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,000
<font color="yellow">Which company do you want
to work for the most?</font>

636
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,090
<font color="yellow">Samsung?
Hyundai?</font>

637
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,900
<font color="yellow">How much do people who work at Hyundai
make a year? Is it over 50 million won?</font>

638
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,090
<font color="yellow">You work all day and night</font>

639
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:48,300
<font color="yellow">but I heard most people burn
out after they turn 40 or so.</font>

640
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:56,500
<font color="yellow">You have to kiss your boss's ass,
and drink even when you don't want to.</font>

641
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,000
<font color="yellow">Do you like having to do that?
Is that how you want to live your life?</font>

642
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,190
<font color="yellow">It makes me feel like,
"how can she work so hard?"</font>

643
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,190
<font color="yellow">It almost makes me wonder
how you can be so diligent.</font>

644
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,690
<font color="yellow">But I want to know if your dream
is to merely work at a company</font>

645
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:18,900
<font color="yellow">after working so hard.</font>

646
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,800
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

647
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,000
<font color="yellow">I sometimes feel embarrassed, too.</font>

648
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,300
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if my dream was to be an
astronaut or the UN's secretary-general.</font>

649
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,900
<font color="yellow">- Oh yeah. Did you get the tip?
- Yeah. You sure left a lot.</font>

650
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,800
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a mistake, right?</font>

651
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,190
<font color="yellow">That much is nothing for those people.</font>

652
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,800
<font color="yellow">I told him about you, and he asked
if I wanted him to pay your tuition.</font>

653
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,500
<font color="yellow">How about it?
Should I ask him to do it?</font>

654
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

655
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,000
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? It's because
it hurts me to watch you suffer.</font>

656
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,690
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

657
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,300
<font color="yellow">They're not asking you to be
their lover, or anything.</font>

658
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,090
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as a scholarship.</font>

659
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,000
<font color="yellow">Then, make it so that I can take the
proper steps to get that scholarship.</font>

660
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,690
<font color="yellow">You're so frustrating.</font>

661
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,900
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped.</font>

662
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,800
<font color="yellow">You don't like me, do you, Senior Yoon?</font>

663
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,000
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

664
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,300
<font color="yellow">Why do you hate me?</font>

665
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,900
<font color="yellow">Do you hate me, or...</font>

666
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,900
<font color="yellow">or my poverty?</font>

667
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,300
<font color="yellow"><i>I hate you because
I'm jealous of you.</i></font>

668
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:55,190
<font color="yellow"><i>I hate you because you have nothing to
your name, and yet make me feel so poor.</i></font>

669
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I hate you because you
make me envy you.</i></font>

670
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,500
<font color="yellow"><i>I hate you because I want
to become like you, but can't.</i></font>

671
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,000
<font color="yellow"><i>So I can't help but to hate you.</i></font>

672
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,300
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why it smells.</i></font>

673
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,190

coming from my envy.</i></font>

674
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,690
<font color="yellow">But there's no rule saying, "only college
students are allowed to live here."</font>

675
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,690
<font color="yellow">The fact that she isn't a
student isn't important!</font>

676
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:34,300
<font color="yellow">What's important is that she lied to us!</font>

677
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,190
<font color="yellow">And for over two years, at that!</font>

678
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:40,190
<font color="yellow">Even that's a flimsy excuse. It's
not like she hurt anyone with that lie.</font>

679
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,090
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
She hurt me!</font>

680
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,900
<font color="yellow">What, are you opposed
to kicking her out, then?</font>

681
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,690
<font color="yellow">You want her to stay?</font>

682
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:52,090
<font color="yellow">Not exactly, but...</font>

683
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,900

<font color="yellow">Well, it hasn't even been long
since I moved in here, and...</font>

686
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,500
<font color="yellow">Who cares about that?
Just state your opinion!</font>

687
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,800
<font color="yellow">I... want to abstain from voting.</font>

688
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,190
<font color="yellow">Wow, you two sure are hospitable.</font>

689
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,590
<font color="yellow">You two are so tolerant, really.</font>

690
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,000

so hospitable toward sluts?</font>

<font color="yellow">Are you okay with that?</font>

694
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,800
<font color="yellow">Who knows what'll
happen with her?</font>

695
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,090
<font color="yellow">A guy might break in here</font>

696
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:33,690

might come and break everything!</font>

698
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,900

What are you going to do?</font>

we should kick Kang Yi Na out.</font>
