<font color="yellow"><i>There are two kinds of secrets.</i></font>

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,390
<font color="yellow"><i>Secrets that you can tell,
and secrets that you can't tell.</i></font>

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,590
<font color="yellow">Want me to tell you a real secret?</font>

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,790
<font color="yellow"><i>I have a secret that
I can never tell anyone.</i></font>

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,690
<font color="yellow">To tell you the the truth...</font>

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,190
<font color="yellow">I can see ghosts.</font>

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,970
<font color="yellow"><i>I killed someone.</i></font>

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,670
<font color="yellow">You can see what?</font>

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,770
<font color="yellow">- Ghosts.
- Really? Since when?</font>

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,270
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth...</font>

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,870
<font color="yellow">There's one over there right now.</font>

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I've killed someone before.</i></font>

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,970
<font color="yellow">Oh, so I guess I did
kill them that time.</font>

16
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,970
<font color="yellow">There's someone that
I wish were dead.</font>

17
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,270
<font color="yellow"><i>It's all just a lie.</i></font>

18
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I've fallen for Song Ji Won's lies
so many times already!</i></font>

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,370
<font color="yellow"><i>She's Song Ji Won,
otherwise known as "Liar Song!"</i></font>

20
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't assume that anything that
comes out of her mouth is true.</i></font>

21
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,170
<font color="yellow"><i>She totally gets a kick out
of watching me fall for her lies.</i></font>

22
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,870
<font color="yellow"><i>She sees ghosts?
Yeah, right.</i></font>

23
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,270
<font color="yellow"><i>She might as well tell me that
Song Joong Ki is her older cousin!</i></font>

24
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,170
<font color="yellow"><i>It's all a lie. It must be a lie.</i></font>

25
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,170
<font color="yellow">Damn it, I'm actually scared!</font>

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,070
<font color="yellow"><i>It didn't scare me at all when she
told me, so why am I scared now?</i></font>

27
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,570
<font color="yellow"><i>Look at her, sleeping so damn peacefully.</i></font>

28
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,770
<font color="yellow"><i>Damn sinner!</i></font>

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,970
<font color="yellow"><i>And here I am, unable
to sleep because of her!</i></font>

30
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,970
<font color="yellow"><i>All right, stop this already.
Let's go to sleep. It's all a lie. Sleep!</i></font>

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not scared at all. Let's sleep.
Sleep is engulfing my body... sleep.</i></font>

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,870
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm tired. Let's go to sleep.</i></font>

33
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,870
<font color="yellow"><i>What the hell?
Why isn't she breathing?</i></font>

34
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,170
<font color="yellow"><i>Is she awake?
What is she doing?</i></font>

35
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,870
<font color="yellow"><i>There was a sound just now, right?</i></font>

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,170
<font color="yellow"><i>Is she moving? Why? To where?</i></font>

37
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I confirm it for myself?</i></font>

38
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,270
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't! What if she's looking
directly at me?</i></font>

39
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,370
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll pretend that I'm sleeping.
I'm asleep! I'm asleep!</i></font>

40
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,370
<font color="yellow"><i>My feet are poking out!
They're in danger! My feet!</i></font>

41
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,670
<font color="yellow"><i>What do I do?
God, save me!</i></font>

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,270
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you doing?</font>

43
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,070
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

44
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,870
<font color="yellow">- Give me some of that.
- Come down and take it yourself!</font>

45
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,670
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

46
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Damn it. I knew I was
craving something sweet.</i></font>

something sweet!</font>

50
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,670
<font color="yellow">What the hell is this?</font>

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,870
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

52
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,470
<font color="yellow">- It's a cockroach!
- Again?</font>

53
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,870
<font color="yellow">Damn it! We set up
traps for them, too!</font>

54
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,470
<font color="yellow">Why was this off by itself? Sheesh.</font>

55
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,470
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

56
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,570
<font color="yellow">Honey, are you still sleeping?</font>

57
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,170
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

58
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,590
<font color="yellow">Did you drink last night?</font>

59
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,790
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? No.</font>

60
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,790
<font color="yellow">Hurry and get up. Hurry! Get up!</font>

61
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,590
<font color="yellow">Hurry! Get up!</font>

62
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,690
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

63
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,990
<font color="yellow">This is yours, right?</font>

64
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,690
<font color="yellow">How could you leave
something like this behind?</font>

65
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,840
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,490
<font color="yellow">If they know you came into our place
I'll get kicked out!</font>

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,990
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- You know, the other day.</font>

68
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,990
<font color="yellow">When my new roommate moved in!
You don't remember that?</font>

69
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,490
<font color="yellow">Ow!</font>

70
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, that day?</font>

71
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,790
<font color="yellow">I think you left this behind while you
rushed, and left this in my laundry.</font>

72
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,990
<font color="yellow">- This isn't mine.
- Really? It really isn't yours?</font>

73
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,290
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure?
- I don't wear boxers.</font>

74
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,690
<font color="yellow">I only wear this kind of underwear.</font>

75
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,990
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have freaked out so
much if I'd known that it wasn't yours.</font>

76
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,590
<font color="yellow">Whose could it be, then?</font>

77
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,290
<font color="yellow">Who brought a guy into our place?</font>

78
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,790
<font color="yellow">- Get over here.
- I can't.</font>

79
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,490
<font color="yellow">- Why not?
- I'm on my period.</font>

80
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,890
<font color="yellow">Then why did you come over?</font>

81
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,190
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

82
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,790
<font color="yellow">It's because you're so pretty.</font>

83
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,690
<font color="yellow">Coming here all dolled up like this,
and then telling me that we can't...</font>

84
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,290
<font color="yellow">You can't do that to me!
Come over here.</font>

85
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,590
<font color="yellow">- We can't!
- Ah.</font>

86
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,960
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

87
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,790
<font color="yellow"><i>To tell you the truth...</i></font>

88
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,890
<font color="yellow"><i>I can see ghosts.</i></font>

89
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,190
<font color="yellow">There's one over there right now.</font>

90
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,290
<font color="yellow">You're back?</font>

91
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,490
<font color="yellow">- Are you the only one here?
- Yes.</font>

92
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,790
<font color="yellow">Where did everyone else go?</font>

93
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,690
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon went to her part-time job,
and Senior Kang went to work out.</font>

94
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,090
<font color="yellow">And Senior Ji Won
said she's going on a date.</font>

95
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,590
<font color="yellow">Again?</font>

96
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,090
<font color="yellow">I'm Song Ji Won, a junior
majoring in Media Studies.</font>

97
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,490
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

98
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,890
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Hae Ra, and I'm also a
junior majoring in the same thing.</font>

99
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,890
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

100
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,290
<font color="yellow">And I'm Kim Na Jung, also a
junior majoring in the same thing.</font>

101
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,590
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

102
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,190
<font color="yellow">- Um, where do you live?
- Did you go to Bangi High School?</font>

103
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,290
<font color="yellow">Hey, we're all the same age,
so let's speak informally.</font>

104
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,990
<font color="yellow">I live in Yeonnamdong, I didn't
graduate from Bangi High School.</font>

105
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,690
<font color="yellow">And my ideal type of man
is Song Joong Ki.</font>

106
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,490
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you all!</font>

107
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,190
<font color="yellow"><i>She goes on dates and group dates, day
after day. She's crazy for a boyfriend.</i></font>

108
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,990
<font color="yellow">She said that she'll get a boy, no matter
what, even if she has to sell her soul.</font>

109
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,990
<font color="yellow">Geez, she has such a crude
way of putting things.</font>

110
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,090
<font color="yellow">Figures. Having no action until you're
22 years old would make anyone restless.</font>

111
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,590
<font color="yellow">At this rate, she could end
up as a 100-year-old virgin.</font>

112
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,590
<font color="yellow">You should be on the move, too.
You shouldn't be home on a weekend!</font>

113
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,590
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Senior Yoon
is still single, too.</font>

114
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,490
<font color="yellow">So, are you going to look to
her as your inspiration?</font>

115
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,990
<font color="yellow">You're going to live without
any spice in your life</font>

116
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,090
<font color="yellow">and live without dating or having
sex, like a total wallflower?</font>

117
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,590
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.
You can't call that living.</font>

118
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,490
<font color="yellow">That's merely existing.</font>

119
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,860
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. That's not what's
important right now, though.</font>

120
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,160
<font color="yellow">I found this hanging
on the balcony.</font>

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,960
<font color="yellow">That could only mean that
a man was here.</font>

122
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,160
<font color="yellow">But, why did you have it in your purse?</font>

123
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,960
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,960
<font color="yellow">Well, I was doing some
preliminary investigating, that's why.</font>

125
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
<font color="yellow">What's the most important
rule at Belle Epoque?</font>

126
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,560
<font color="yellow">No guys allowed in here.</font>

127
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,660
<font color="yellow">And this means that someone
broke that important rule!</font>

128
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
<font color="yellow">But, why did they leave
their underwear here?</font>

129
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,560
<font color="yellow">Are you an idiot? Do you think they left
it behind because they took a crap in it?</font>

130
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,360
<font color="yellow">They definitely did excrete something
from their body, but it wasn't that.</font>

131
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
<font color="yellow">Who do you think it was?</font>

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,760
<font color="yellow">- Well, I'm not sure.
- Who else could it be?</font>

133
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,160
<font color="yellow">It's definitely Senior Kang.</font>

134
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,660
<font color="yellow">She said so herself that she's
currently seeing a lot of different men.</font>

135
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,260
<font color="yellow">And judging from her vibe, I feel
like she does one night stands, too.</font>

136
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,960
<font color="yellow">One night stands?
What's that?</font>

137
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
<font color="yellow">You're not really
from Yesang, right?</font>

138
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,260
<font color="yellow">You actually lived in a
monastery all your life, right?</font>

139
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,660
<font color="yellow">You know, sleeping with someone
on the day that you met them!</font>

140
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,960
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

141
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,360
<font color="yellow">There are people who
really do that kind of thing?</font>

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,660
<font color="yellow">Yeah! Exhibit A, Senior Kang!</font>

143
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,260
<font color="yellow"><i>It's not like she was
an Olympic athlete.</i></font>

144
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,560
<font color="yellow"><i>It's not like she's trying to decrease
her record by a tenth of a second.</i></font>

145
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
<font color="yellow"><i>All she's doing is jogging
around the neighborhood</i></font>

146
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,960
<font color="yellow"><i>so why does she dress like that?</i></font>

147
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,460
<font color="yellow"><i>She could just wear sweats
and run!</i></font>

148
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,160
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

149
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,960
<font color="yellow">Um, yes, I'm fine.</font>

150
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,260
<font color="yellow"><i>She's doing all of that
to try and seduce men.</i></font>

151
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,660
<font color="yellow"><i>That girl is seriously...</i></font>

152
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,460
<font color="yellow"><i>She may call it pheromones or something,
but that's definitely not it.</i></font>

153
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,460
<font color="yellow"><i>It's clear that she only gets all those
men because of the way she dresses.</i></font>

154
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,860
<font color="yellow">Honestly, she's not
even that pretty.</font>

155
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,560
<font color="yellow">No, she's pretty.</font>

156
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,560
<font color="yellow">Yeah, she is, but she's not
like, super crazy pretty.</font>

157
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,960
<font color="yellow">She's just an average
amount of pretty.</font>

158
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,360
<font color="yellow">Compare her to me, you,
or Song Ji Won.</font>

159
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,560
<font color="yellow">It's not like she's like, ridiculously
prettier than the rest of us.</font>

160
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,560
<font color="yellow">- Let's look for evidence.
- What?</font>

161
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,560
<font color="yellow">Senior Kang has her own room.
So if she had a man here</font>

162
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,260
<font color="yellow">there will definitely be some
evidence of that, in there.</font>

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,460
<font color="yellow">What kind of evidence?</font>

164
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,560
<font color="yellow">You'll know when you see it.</font>

165
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,660
<font color="yellow">And what are you going to do
if you do find evidence?</font>

166
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,160
<font color="yellow"><i>"RULE ONE OF BELLE EPOQUE: If you bring a
man in here, you'll get kicked out."</i></font>

167
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
<font color="yellow">You want to kick her out?</font>

168
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,760
<font color="yellow">She could also pay a fine.</font>

169
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,360
<font color="yellow">That's a guy's voice, right?</font>

170
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,660
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

171
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

172
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me why
I'm in front of my own room?</font>

173
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,460
<font color="yellow">Who's the man in your room?</font>

174
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,360
<font color="yellow">Man?</font>

175
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,660
<font color="yellow"><i>You're Jack the Ripper!</i></font>

176
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,260
<font color="yellow">Is that the man that you
were talking about?</font>

177
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,460
<font color="yellow">You left your TV on again?</font>

178
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,560
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon will have a fit
if she finds out!</font>

179
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,160
<font color="yellow">That's why you have to keep
this on the down low, okay?</font>

180
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,960
<font color="yellow">I knew that it was strange that
I couldn't understand any of it.</font>

181
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,360
<font color="yellow">That's that, but... you
brought a man here, right?</font>

182
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,960
<font color="yellow">This wasn't me.</font>

183
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,560
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on. It totally was!</font>

184
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,760
<font color="yellow">This is a knockoff! The men that I see
wouldn't wear cheap stuff like this.</font>

185
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,160
<font color="yellow">"Men?" As in, plural?</font>

186
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, "men!"
- Hey! Stop it!</font>

187
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,260
<font color="yellow">Also, why would I do that here?
It'd be a pain to clean up afterwards.</font>

188
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
<font color="yellow">I'd much rather go to a motel.</font>

189
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,660
<font color="yellow">Wow, I bet your mom would be so
proud if she heard you say that!</font>

190
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,460
<font color="yellow">What the hell?
So it was a knockoff?</font>

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,560
<font color="yellow">Then, who could it have been?</font>

192
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
<font color="yellow">Maybe it was Senior Yoon?</font>

193
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,460
<font color="yellow">- Nah, no way.
- Why not?</font>

194
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,860
<font color="yellow">That's because she simply
has no time for stuff like that.</font>

195
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,160
<font color="yellow">And Senior Yoon has no interest in men.</font>

196
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,460
<font color="yellow">She doesn't?</font>

197
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,660
<font color="yellow">Would a person who does,
go around looking like her?</font>

198
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Makeup? As if. She doesn't even
wash her face sometimes!</i></font>

199
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you know why Senior Yoon
is growing her hair out?</i></font>

200
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,360
<font color="yellow"><i>It's so that she doesn't have
to go to the hair salon!</i></font>

201
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,160
<font color="yellow"><i>Isn't styling your hair into a ponytail
at 28 years old a bit much?</i></font>

202
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,960
<font color="yellow">Also, Senior Yoon doesn't have
any brightly colored clothing.</font>

203
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,360
<font color="yellow">That's so that you can't tell
that they haven't been washed.</font>

204
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,360
<font color="yellow"><i>And she wears the same
pair of shoes, rain or shine.</i></font>

205
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,260
<font color="yellow"><i>There's even a legend that those
sneakers were once white!</i></font>

206
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Just look at the state she's in. Do you
think any man would be attracted to that?</i></font>

207
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,260
<font color="yellow">Well, that's because she's busy.</font>

208
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,460
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, Senior Yoon
has no feminine qualities.</font>

209
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,760
<font color="yellow">- But...
- Asexual reproduction suits her better.</font>

210
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,360
<font color="yellow">Just like an amoeba.</font>

211
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,100
<font color="yellow">But psychologically speaking, there are
guys who are into those types of women.</font>

212
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,360
<font color="yellow"><i>There are men who think,
"I'll make a lady of you!"</i></font>

213
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Figures. That's just like the character
from the manga, "Candy Candy."</i></font>

214
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,160
<font color="yellow">Safe!</font>

215
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,760
<font color="yellow">You're not late.</font>

216
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,560
<font color="yellow">Cool off a bit before you go inside.
You still have five minutes left.</font>

217
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,360
<font color="yellow">- We've got this!
- Yes, sir...</font>

218
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,660
<font color="yellow">- Fire!
- Fire!</font>

219
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Senior Yoon definitely
isn't the one.</i></font>

220
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,260
<font color="yellow">You know as well as I do that
she has no free time whatsoever!</font>

221
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,860
<font color="yellow">So how could she have
time to sleep with a guy</font>

222
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,060
<font color="yellow">when she barely has
any time to sleep?</font>

223
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,460
<font color="yellow">That's true, but...</font>

224
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,060
<font color="yellow">It's more likely that it's Song Ji Won
than Senior Yoon.</font>

225
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,960
<font color="yellow">She goes on dates every day, so who
knows? She could have gotten lucky once.</font>

226
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,460
<font color="yellow">She can be unexpectedly
daring at times.</font>

227
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,760
<font color="yellow">- What do you like?
- Anything is fine.</font>

228
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,960
<font color="yellow">Please let me know
when you've decided.</font>

229
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

230
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,060
<font color="yellow">Did you all order?
What, you still haven't?</font>

231
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,760
<font color="yellow">Give that here.
I'll order for you guys.</font>

232
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,260
<font color="yellow">Fish cake stew. Stir-fried bean sprouts.
And chili shrimp.</font>

233
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
<font color="yellow">Their fish cake stew
is to die for!</font>

234
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,860
<font color="yellow">And they give you a large portion
for the stir-fried bean sprouts.</font>

235
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,460
<font color="yellow">And the chili shrimp is really spicy.
You're okay with spicy food, right?</font>

236
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,760
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

237
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,160
<font color="yellow">Okay. And then, one bottle of soju
and three bottles of beer.</font>

238
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,860
<font color="yellow">We can order more if we
need more. Okay?</font>

239
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,960
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

240
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,560
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

241
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,060
<font color="yellow">I'm taking more alcohol!
Please add that to our tab!</font>

242
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,960
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you guys talking?
Come on, drink up! Drink...</font>

243
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,060
<font color="yellow">Let's make a soju and beer
cocktail! Let's do this!</font>

244
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,260
<font color="yellow">All right. Point your chopstick
of love at the person</font>

245
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,760
<font color="yellow">who you want to spend the
rest of your twenties with!</font>

246
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,960
<font color="yellow">Let's do it on the count of three!
One, two, three!</font>

247
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,160
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it must be Song Ji Won.</font>

248
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,760
<font color="yellow">- If you want any, tell me now.
- No, I'm not having any!</font>

249
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,860
<font color="yellow">I just had a snack
not too long ago.</font>

250
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,560
<font color="yellow">You're really not going to
have any, right?</font>

251
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,660
<font color="yellow">I had a lot of fun today.</font>

252
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,660
<font color="yellow">- Oh, me too.
- How are you getting home?</font>

253
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,460
<font color="yellow">The Bus! Number 7027!
Or the 7501!</font>

254
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,260
<font color="yellow">Oh really, I'm going that way.
Well, bye, then!</font>

255
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,660
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

256
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
<font color="yellow">I thought you said that you
weren't having any!</font>

257
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
<font color="yellow">I tried, but... this is your fault!</font>

258
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,360
<font color="yellow">How could you eat something like this
in front of someone who's dieting?</font>

259
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
<font color="yellow">Why the hell did she say that she
wasn't going to have any, then?</font>

260
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,060
<font color="yellow">She ate all of it,
and I only got three bites!</font>

261
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

262
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,560
<font color="yellow">This is yours, right?</font>

263
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,760
<font color="yellow">Spill! You brought a
guy here, didn't you?</font>

264
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,560
<font color="yellow">You two did all sorts of dirty stuff,
and then he left this here, right?</font>

265
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,360
<font color="yellow">What the hell kind of
nonsense is that?</font>

266
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,160
<font color="yellow">I wish there was a guy
that I could do that with.</font>

267
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,160
<font color="yellow">We laughed together
and had a great time!</font>

268
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,560
<font color="yellow">He laughed so loudly every time
I said something, and only talked to me!</font>

269
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:29,060
<font color="yellow">So, why? Why is it that only
the restaurant owner likes me?</font>

270
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,060
<font color="yellow">I guess it didn't work out for
her this time, either.</font>

271
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,660
<font color="yellow">What if it's you?</font>

272
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,060
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

273
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,060
<font color="yellow">You just turned 20 years old.
You're an adult now.</font>

274
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,760
<font color="yellow">So naturally, you're at the age when
you want to do all kinds of things.</font>

275
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,160
<font color="yellow">I heard that girls who look innocent like
you are different than they seem!</font>

276
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,660
<font color="yellow">- "You trust me, right, Yoon Jae?"
- Stop it.</font>

277
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,760
<font color="yellow">"It's all right.
This is how adults play."</font>

278
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,160
<font color="yellow">Why is it that everyone has to
tease me at least once a day?</font>

279
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,160
<font color="yellow">Everyone? Who else does this to you?</font>

280
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,460
<font color="yellow">You don't eat peanuts? Why not?</font>

281
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,960
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

282
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,260
<font color="yellow">- Or, were you saving them for later?
- No.</font>

283
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,060
<font color="yellow">- Did they go bad?

284
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,760

285
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,560

286

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

287
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,760
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- Um... that's...</font>

288
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,260
<font color="yellow">- I can't believe you.
- No...</font>

289
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,560
<font color="yellow">Hey, even if you want me that badly,
this is sexual harassment!</font>

290
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,760
<font color="yellow">- No, that's not it.
- Unbelievable.</font>

291

292

293
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,160

school because of him!</font>

294
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,260
<font color="yellow">Figures. You just have
a face that says, "kick me!"</font>

295
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,760
<font color="yellow">Aren't those boxers
your boyfriend's?</font>

296
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,960
<font color="yellow">I already went and confirmed it.
My honey only wears briefs.</font>

297
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,760
<font color="yellow">So that means that there was a reason
why you needed to go and confirm.</font>

298
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,960
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

299
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
<font color="yellow">And the fact that you took them
out of your purse is a bit suspicious.</font>

300
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,260

who brought a guy here.</font>

302
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,660

How am I supposed to talk to ghosts?</font>

303
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,160
<font color="yellow">You can't? What the hell? So it doesn't
matter if you can see ghosts?</font>

304
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,960
<font color="yellow">If that were possible, I'd ask them
when I'd get a boyfriend, first!</font>

305
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,960

winning lottery numbers. Right?</font>

310
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160

312
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,560

- Yeah, yeah, whatever.</font>

313
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,560
<font color="yellow">So you can see lies, and ghosts,
and other people's sins, too?</font>

317

<font color="yellow">Wait, so what's an aura?</font>

318
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,260
<font color="yellow">The aura of people who
lie are darker colors.</font>

319
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,260
<font color="yellow">And Senior Kang's aura is like that.</font>

00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,760
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I couldn't wrap it
because I didn't have time.</font>

427
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,660
<font color="yellow">It's what's inside that
counts, though, right?</font>

428
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,960
<font color="yellow">- You're not going to open it?
- Huh? Yeah.</font>

429
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,460
<font color="yellow">Oh... it's perfume.</font>

430
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,060
<font color="yellow">What, do you not like it?</font>

431
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,760
<font color="yellow">No, I do.</font>

432
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,260
<font color="yellow">- Is it because it's cheap?
- No. It's not like that.</font>

433
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,160
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

434
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,260
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you something
better next time.</font>

435
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,960
<font color="yellow">Something expensive.</font>

436
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,960
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to use this?
- What is it?</font>

437
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,760
<font color="yellow">A makeup store opened
up in front of our school.</font>

438
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
<font color="yellow">It's a free handout since
they just opened.</font>

439
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,460
<font color="yellow">Why are they giving out
something like this?</font>

440
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
<font color="yellow">He's still there.</font>

441
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,560
<font color="yellow">He was there when I went to
the convenience store before, too.</font>

442
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,260
<font color="yellow">How many hours has
he been there, already?</font>

443
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,760
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

444
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,360
<font color="yellow">Please accept these flowers, Miss.</font>

445
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,160
<font color="yellow">How sad.</font>

446
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,960
<font color="yellow">He waited so long
to see Senior Kang!</font>

447
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,060
<font color="yellow">I wish I could experience
that once in my life!</font>

448
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,960
<font color="yellow">You like that? I'd hate that!
I'd totally hate that.</font>

449
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,360
<font color="yellow">Really? I'm kind of jealous.</font>

450
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,060
<font color="yellow">You're jealous of a guy who waits for
you in front of your house, with flowers?</font>

451
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,960
<font color="yellow">This isn't 1988.
How old fashioned.</font>

452
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,460
<font color="yellow">Ugh, it's so tacky!</font>

453
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,560
<font color="yellow">I'd probably not like the guy as much
if they acted like that toward me.</font>

454
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

455
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,460
<font color="yellow">You don't know what kind
of person I am, though.</font>

456
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,760
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying that you don't
like me, even though you don't know me?</font>

457
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,260
<font color="yellow">Do you know me? How well do you know
me that you're saying that you like me?</font>

458
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
<font color="yellow">We're both judging each other
based on outward appearances.</font>

459
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,060
<font color="yellow">And I'm not interested
in you at all.</font>

460
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,560
<font color="yellow">And I won't be in the future, either.</font>

461
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,360
<font color="yellow">So don't ever do anything
like this again.</font>

462
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,260
<font color="yellow">And don't you dare call me again!</font>

463
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,060
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh me, oh my. What is love, I wonder?</i></font>

464
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,760
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. What did
you get as a gift?</font>

465
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,060
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

466
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,260
<font color="yellow">Is today some special day?</font>

467
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,360
<font color="yellow">It's their one-year anniversary!</font>

468
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,160
<font color="yellow">She quit drinking coffee for a month so
she could buy her boyfriend his gift!</font>

469
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,260
<font color="yellow">I was completely shocked.</font>

470
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,760
<font color="yellow">So, what did your honey get you?
A purse? A ring?</font>

471
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you so nosy?</font>

472
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,860
<font color="yellow">I want to become happy
vicariously through you!</font>

473
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,660
<font color="yellow">Come on, show me!</font>

474
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,260
<font color="yellow">- Oh no. He forgot, didn't he?
- No!</font>

475
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,960
<font color="yellow">He planned a trip for us this
weekend. Two days, one night.</font>

476
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,160
<font color="yellow">You're so lucky.
Where are you going?</font>

477
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
<font color="yellow">Chuncheon.</font>

478
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,260
<font color="yellow">Then why do you have that
kind of expression?</font>

479
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,160
<font color="yellow">You look like you got blown off.</font>

480
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,960
<font color="yellow">Because he didn't even ask me about
my schedule before planning this.</font>

481
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,660
<font color="yellow">I'm so damn jealous of you.
Talk about first world problems!</font>

482
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,960
<font color="yellow">What are you going to
do for two whole days?</font>

483
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,260
<font color="yellow">You're going to this
and that, right?</font>

484
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,160
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- Stop it, already!</font>

485
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,760
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?
All you ever talk about is sex!</font>

486
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,560
<font color="yellow">Are you a pervert?</font>

487
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,460
<font color="yellow">Hey, I was just joking
around a bit...</font>

488
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,460
<font color="yellow">It may seem like a joke to you, but
it feels like harassment to me!</font>

489
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,660
<font color="yellow">You've been saying a lot of messed up
stuff lately, without thinking.</font>

490
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,760
<font color="yellow">You even said last time that you
think that Senior Kang is lying!</font>

491
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
<font color="yellow">You said that she has
a liar's aura about her!</font>

492
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,260
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

493
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,760
<font color="yellow">Um, what I meant was...</font>

494
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,360
<font color="yellow">Wow, that's quite impressive.
How did you know that I was lying?</font>

495
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,160
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry about before.
I went too far.</i></font>

496
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,460
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry, too.</i></font>

497
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Cheer up and have a good trip.</i></font>

498
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,260
<font color="yellow"><i>By the way, Chuncheon's stir-fried spicy
chicken is available as takeout!</i></font>

499
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Forget it!</i></font>

500
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,560
<font color="yellow"><i>What time are you leaving?</i></font>

501
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,660
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to
continue doing this?</font>

502
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,460
<font color="yellow">Eh?</font>

503
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,960
<font color="yellow"><i>Hehehehehe.</i></font>

504
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,060
<font color="yellow">Stop it, already. Hey!</font>

505
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,360
<font color="yellow">Madame Jung is making her exit!
Come on out, everyone!</font>

506
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,960
<font color="yellow">- Sheesh!
- She's heading out!</font>

507
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,060
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

508
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,160
<font color="yellow">She says she's going to Chuncheon.
She must be so happy, right?</font>

509
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
<font color="yellow">She's going with her love, after all! But
shall I tell you something more shocking?</font>

510
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,060
<font color="yellow">They can spend an entire
night together, on their own!</font>

511
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,760
<font color="yellow">Stop it, already!</font>

512
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,060
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay. Bye, now!</font>

513
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,960
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm so nervous!
I'll be back soon, everyone!</font>

514
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,160
<font color="yellow">Have fun.</font>

515
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,660
<font color="yellow">Oh, wait, wait!</font>

516
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,160
<font color="yellow">This isn't much money, but...</font>

517
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,360
<font color="yellow">use this to buy wine
and scented candles.</font>

518
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,560
<font color="yellow">And buy some essential oils if
you have any money left over!</font>

519
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,960
<font color="yellow">Sheesh!</font>

520
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,360
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, then!
I'm really leaving now!</font>

521
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,560
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye!</font>

522
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,360
<font color="yellow">You better have fun, okay?
Let's go!</font>

523
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,760
<font color="yellow">- Let's go!
- Let's go!</font>

524
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,160
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

525
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,460

<font color="yellow">Did you enjoy that?</font>

531
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,160
<font color="yellow">You almost killed me!</font>

532
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,360
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

533
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,260
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. You used three million
won last month, didn't you?</font>

534
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,660
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

535
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,060
<font color="yellow">You used way too much!</font>

536
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,160
<font color="yellow">Sorry. My friend was in
the hospital this month, so...</font>

537
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,060
<font color="yellow">Limit your spending to
two million won, okay?</font>

538
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,560
<font color="yellow">It'll be too rough on me

541
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,660
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

542
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,460
<font color="yellow">Is it obvious that I'm a liar?</font>

543
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,460

00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,160

going at it for hours now.</font>

555
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,960
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they're doing all sorts of crazy
positions that you only see in porn.</font>

556
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,060
<font color="yellow">What's with that expression of yours?</font>

557
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,460
<font color="yellow">You look like you just got
mooned by a pervert!</font>

558
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,960
<font color="yellow">Is it that obvious?</font>

559
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,160
<font color="yellow">I've been crazy receptive to
other people's vibes lately.</font>

560
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,760
<font color="yellow">I can't even study properly!</font>

561
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,760

dirty thoughts because I can't study.</font>

<font color="yellow">Or if it's because of my dirty
thoughts that I can't study.</font>

00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,160
<font color="yellow">I even had a wet dream last night!
In my dream, I...</font>

<font color="yellow">Stop it! Seriously!</font>

565
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,560
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

566
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,460
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to hear it, never mind.
It's a really great story, though.</font>

567
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,960
<font color="yellow">- Senior.
- What? You want to hear about it, right?</font>

568
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,160
<font color="yellow">In my dream last night,
I was in the rain...</font>

569
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,660
<font color="yellow">No. Not that.</font>

570
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,460

you said was in the cupboard?</font>

572
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
<font color="yellow">You're curious about the
gender of the ghost, too?</font>

573
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,460
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

574
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,160
<font color="yellow">Why are all of you curious about that?</font>

575
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,230
<font color="yellow">Senior Kang asked me about that,
and so did Senior Yoon.</font>

576
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,230
<font color="yellow">- Senor Yoon did, too?
- Yeah.</font>

577

that comes to mind.</font>

them that time, after all.</font>

<font color="yellow">So?</font>

582
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:40,330

- Is the ghost a boy or a girl?</font>

633
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,890

640
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,190

00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,820

648
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,420
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

649
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,220

were Senior Kang's!</font>

650
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,820
<font color="yellow">When did I say that?</font>

651
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,720
<font color="yellow">I said that she was lying,
not that the boxers were hers.</font>

What were you doing?</font>

659
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,220

<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

694
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,620
<font color="yellow">He said prostitution, right?</font>

695
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:32,920
<font color="yellow">Yeah. He said that men have
been buying Senior Kang with money.</font>

696
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,120
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- Yeah. Wow.</font>

697
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,420
<font color="yellow">I thought she said that her dad has
a factory that makes tableware.</font>

698
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,220
<font color="yellow">I told you, it's a
wet wipes factory!</font>

699
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,420
<font color="yellow">At any rate, I guess she lied
about her family being rich.</font>

700
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,020
<font color="yellow">Why would she need to do that
if they were actually rich?</font>

701
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,020
<font color="yellow">There are plenty of girls
with sugar daddies.</font>

702
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,020
<font color="yellow">Why would guys buy her designer bags
and give her money for free, though?</font>

703
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,020
<font color="yellow">There's no way. It's clearly
a give-and-take situation.</font>

704
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,220
<font color="yellow">She's basically accepting money for sex.
In other words, she's just a hooker.</font>

705
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,220
<font color="yellow">A hooker.</font>

706
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,720
<font color="yellow">It's not... like I said
anything that's untrue.</font>

707
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,620
<font color="yellow">Senior Kang is the one
in the wrong here!</font>

708
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,420
<font color="yellow">And I don't like that she's been lying
to us up until now, either.</font>

709
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,720
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

710
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,620
<font color="yellow">The aura of people who
lie are darker colors.</font>

711
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,620
<font color="yellow">And Senior Kang's aura
is just like that.</font>

712
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,520
