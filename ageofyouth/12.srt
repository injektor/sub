00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,000
<font color="yellow">She said that it was all a lie</font>

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,500
<font color="yellow">when she said that you saw ghosts,
that the ghost was mad</font>

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,800
<font color="yellow">and that the ghost was the spirit
of someone who was murdered!</font>

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,100
<font color="yellow">I was so shocked!</font>

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,899
<font color="yellow">Why would she tell a lie like that?</font>

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,500
<font color="yellow">I mean, people always have a
reason for the lies they tell, right?</font>

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,899
<font color="yellow">She said that it was just a prank,
but it's been months since she started!</font>

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,100
<font color="yellow">Can you really just call that a
simple prank? No, that's fraud!</font>

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,100
<font color="yellow">I mean, I didn't think about it too
much, since I believe in God</font>

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,200
<font color="yellow">but other people are at a loss,
now that her lie has been exposed</font>

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,000
<font color="yellow">because they always believed
every word that she said.</font>

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,100
<font color="yellow">Everyone thought that the ghost
was someone they knew.</font>

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,700
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why do you
think she did such a thing?</font>

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,100
<font color="yellow">I just don't get it!</font>

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,900

her one more time?</i></font>

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,000
<font color="yellow"><i>And tell her that I didn't
mean to do that</i></font>

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,700
<font color="yellow"><i>and that I kept losing my
chances to tell the truth?</i></font>

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,900
<font color="yellow"><i>And that she doesn't need to worry,
because I won't tell anyone her secret?</i></font>

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,900
<font color="yellow"><i>She probably thinks that
I'm cocky and disgusting.</i></font>

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,000
<font color="yellow"><i>No. If I say something like that,
it might just make matters worse.</i></font>

26
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,000
<font color="yellow"><i>She's probably thinking, "look at
that murderer, eating apples."</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>What will everyone say?</i></font>

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,099
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh... I don't know.</i></font>

30
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,900
<font color="yellow">Do you want an apple?</font>

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,300
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,500
<font color="yellow">They say that eating apples
in the morning is like medicine</font>

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,300
<font color="yellow">but eating apples
at night is like poison!</font>

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,900
<font color="yellow">That's how the saying goes.</font>

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,500
<font color="yellow">It's just a saying.</font>

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,000
<font color="yellow">What would you do if someone told you
you didn't have many days left to live?</font>

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,000
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,300
<font color="yellow">Just asking.
I was just curious.</font>

39
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,000
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering what
others would do in that situation.</font>

40
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Things I must do.</i></font>

41
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,699
<font color="yellow"><i>Things that I want to do.</i></font>

42
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,199
<font color="yellow"><i>Speaking of which, she's weird, too.</i></font>

43
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,500
<font color="yellow">It seriously made me wonder if
she had mental issues, at first.</font>

44
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,300
<font color="yellow">She won't clearly state her
opinion about anything.</font>

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:26,399
<font color="yellow">The only thing she ever says is, "that's
not true, Senior?" in her mumbly voice.</font>

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,000
<font color="yellow">It kind of seems like she's a
misanthrope, and... oh yeah!</font>

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,199
<font color="yellow">She reminds me of a dog
that was abused as a puppy.</font>

48
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,500
<font color="yellow">She's always flinching,
and is always so hesitant!</font>

49
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
<font color="yellow">I don't know why she has
such little self-esteem!</font>

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,800
<font color="yellow">I mean, she's not ugly.</font>

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,699
<font color="yellow">And if she got into our school,
that means that she's smart, too.</font>

52
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,000
<font color="yellow">Isn't it strange?</font>

53
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,899
<font color="yellow">You eat parsley?</font>

54
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:55,800
<font color="yellow">I don't really like it.
It tastes so soapy.</font>

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,699
<font color="yellow">It's actually my first time trying it.
I just wanted to try it once.</font>

56
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,699
<font color="yellow">- It tastes weird.
- Right?</font>

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,899
<font color="yellow">You can't bear to eat any more of that?</font>

58
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,399
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

59
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,899
<font color="yellow">Want to go and drink some alcohol?</font>

60
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,000
<font color="yellow">Alcohol?</font>

61
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,199
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

62
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,300
<font color="yellow">I want to get a bit drunk.</font>

63
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,100
<font color="yellow">Is there something you're worried about?</font>

64
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

65
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,800
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

66
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,500
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you a bit later.</font>

67
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,000
<font color="yellow">All right. Drink up, okay?
Drink as much as you want!</font>

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,899
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for you,
and take you home.</font>

69
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,600
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

70
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,500
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

71
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,199
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

72
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,699
<font color="yellow">You know... later on...</font>

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,699
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

74
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,100
<font color="yellow">When you find out
the truth about me...</font>

75
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
<font color="yellow">Keep going. I'm listening.</font>

76
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,699
<font color="yellow">Don't... hate me too much, okay?</font>

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

78
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:29,699
<font color="yellow">The lines need to be uniform from
beginning to end, when you're shading.</font>

79
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,699
<font color="yellow">And take some of that
pressure out of your wrist!</font>

80
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,800
<font color="yellow">Just focus on your own.</font>

81
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,899
<font color="yellow">We're supposed to help each other.</font>

82
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,000
<font color="yellow">What's so great about her?
She thinks she's all that!</font>

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,199
<font color="yellow">She thinks that she can
just do whatever she wants!</font>

84
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,699
<font color="yellow">She's been living however
she wanted all this time</font>

85
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,699
<font color="yellow">and she's saying she wants
to become a designer now!</font>

86
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,899
<font color="yellow">Geez. Does that even make any sense?</font>

87
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,800
<font color="yellow">Does she think that all designers
have to do is wear nice clothes?</font>

88
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,500
<font color="yellow">She's trying to re-invent herself now,
when she's 24 years old!</font>

89
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
<font color="yellow">Geez. I feel like I wouldn't be
able to get any sleep at night</font>

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
<font color="yellow">because of anxiety, if I were her.</font>

91
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,149
<font color="yellow">She has delusions of grandeur!</font>

92
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,699
<font color="yellow">She's the one who should be here,
not me!</font>

93
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,699
<font color="yellow"><i>What if I'm in huge trouble?</i></font>

94
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,699
<font color="yellow"><i>I've set an unstable objective
for myself, at my unstable age.</i></font>

95
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Maybe I should just quit.</i></font>

96
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,500
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?
Is it not going well?</font>

97
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,000
<font color="yellow">No, I'm getting better bit by bit.</font>

98
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,700
<font color="yellow">Really?
That's great.</font>

99
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,500
<font color="yellow">Are you going to your part-time
job at the convenience store?</font>

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- You're heading out early.</font>

101
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,200
<font color="yellow">The person working before me
asked me to cover for them a little.</font>

102
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,899
<font color="yellow">- See you later.
- Okay.</font>

103
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,200
<font color="yellow"><i>This is so embarrassing. I'm so
embarrassed that I can't even quit.</i></font>

104
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,899
<font color="yellow"><i>If I give up after putting this little
effort into it, they'll all laugh at me.</i></font>

105
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,299
<font color="yellow"><i>How could she manage to study
in that kind of situation?</i></font>

106
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,100
<font color="yellow">She's the same as always, even though</font>

107
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,799
<font color="yellow">her mom is in jail and her brother still
hasn't even had his funeral yet.</font>

108
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,000
<font color="yellow">How could she manage to keep attending
school, and going to her part-time jobs</font>

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,299
<font color="yellow">and studying, in that kind of situation?</font>

110
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,299
<font color="yellow">It's like she has no emotions.
She's like a robot!</font>

111
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:08,799
<font color="yellow">And also, I found out not too long ago
that her brother was in a coma.</font>

112
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,799
<font color="yellow">It's been two years since
we've known each other</font>

113
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,200
<font color="yellow">so how could she not have said
anything about that to me, for that long?</font>

114
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,700
<font color="yellow">I was a bit disappointed, honestly.</font>

115
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,799
<font color="yellow">At any rate, none of them are normal.</font>

116
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
<font color="yellow">What the...</font>

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,200
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

118
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,899
<font color="yellow">I need the fridge.</font>

119
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,700
<font color="yellow">Oh... sure.</font>

120
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,299
<font color="yellow">When are the results
for the autopsy coming out?</font>

121
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,500
<font color="yellow">Next Wednesday.</font>

122
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,399
<font color="yellow">If, by any chance, you...</font>

123
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,200
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hot?</font>

124
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,700
<font color="yellow">In this? It's thinner than you'd think.
It's pretty nice and cool.</font>

125
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,799
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

126
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,700
<font color="yellow">You're going to wear that?</font>

127
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,299
<font color="yellow">This is the only black thing I have.
Hurry.</font>

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,600
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

129
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,200
<font color="yellow">How could she wear that?
She might as well just wear red!</font>

130
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,299
<font color="yellow">How could she wear that?</font>

131
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,600
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

132
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:24,100
<font color="yellow">How did you get here?</font>

133
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,200
<font color="yellow">We took the village bus and
got off in front of the center</font>

134
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,399
<font color="yellow">and then took the number 760 bus,
which brought us straight here.</font>

135
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,799
<font color="yellow">Of course we should be here.</font>

136
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,700
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

137
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,700
<font color="yellow">You can get up now.</font>

138
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

139
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,399
<font color="yellow">- Oh man, I'm tearing up!
- That was so funny.</font>

140
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,600
<font color="yellow">- We're sorry for laughing.
- I laughed too, so it's okay.</font>

141
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
<font color="yellow">Look at what happened, because of you!</font>

142
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,899
<font color="yellow">What? What'd I do?
Hey, you're sweating.</font>

143
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,100
<font color="yellow">It's because I laughed too much.</font>

144
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,299
<font color="yellow">They'll probably think that we're crazy.</font>

145
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:48,700
<font color="yellow">It's strange. Despite the situation,
I couldn't help but laugh.</font>

146
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

147
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,899
<font color="yellow">What about your mom?</font>

148
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,299
<font color="yellow">She's on her way here.</font>

149
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,600
<font color="yellow">You all should be going now.</font>

150
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,899
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

151
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,299
<font color="yellow">There's not much to do here, anyway.</font>

152
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,000
<font color="yellow">And you have classes, right?</font>

153
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,799
<font color="yellow">Oh... but still...</font>

154
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,600
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.
Go on now.</font>

155
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,899
<font color="yellow">Go. It's okay.</font>

156
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,100
<font color="yellow">- Bye, then!
- Okay.</font>

157
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,899
<font color="yellow">- We'll be going.
- Bye.</font>

158
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,799
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

159
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,299
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

160
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:32,500
<font color="yellow">On that day... um, so, on the day
that happened to your brother...</font>

161
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,299
<font color="yellow">if your mother hadn't
done what she did...</font>

162
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:39,500
<font color="yellow">You want to know if I
would've done it instead?</font>

163
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,799
<font color="yellow">Probably.</font>

164
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,000
<font color="yellow">Why? Why did you think to
do that, all of a sudden?</font>

165
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything up until now.</font>

166
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,200
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if that, by any
chance... was because of me.</font>

167
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,500
<font color="yellow">Because I lied about seeing a ghost.</font>

168
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,399
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it might have been.</font>

169
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,700
<font color="yellow">I never once thought about it before
you started talking about a ghost.</font>

170
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,200
<font color="yellow">I only thought about whether
my brother was alive or dead.</font>

171
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,799
<font color="yellow">I never thought of anything beyond that.</font>

172
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,100
<font color="yellow">Before you talked about the ghost</font>

173
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,799
<font color="yellow">I never thought about his soul,
how he felt, or what he wanted me to do.</font>

174
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,100
<font color="yellow">Or what I'd want, if I were in
Soo Myung's situation.</font>

175
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,799
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

176
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,100
<font color="yellow">Thanks for lying to me.</font>

177
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,200
<font color="yellow"><i>How old was Senior Yoon's
younger brother, again?</i></font>

178
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,700
<font color="yellow">22 years old.</font>

179
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,200
<font color="yellow">I wonder how old he was
when that photo was taken.</font>

180
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,799
<font color="yellow">He looked really young.</font>

181
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,299
<font color="yellow">He looked like he was
way too young to die.</font>

182
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,900
<font color="yellow">Maybe we should've stayed a bit longer.</font>

183
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah. We should have
stayed a bit longer.</font>

184
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,799
<font color="yellow">She told us to go, though.</font>

185
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,299
<font color="yellow">She might actually just
want to be alone right now.</font>

186
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,000
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

187
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,299
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't want to be alone
if I were her, though.</font>

188
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,099
<font color="yellow">What do you think will happen
to Senior Yoon's mom?</font>

189
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,500
<font color="yellow">They said she'll probably
just be on probation</font>

190
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,299
<font color="yellow">due to the nature of the situation.</font>

191
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,500
<font color="yellow">Are you hot?</font>

192
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,700
<font color="yellow">No. I just feel itchy.</font>

193
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
<font color="yellow">Have you been to a lot of
these types of things before?</font>

194
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,000
<font color="yellow">You knew exactly what to do.</font>

195
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,099
<font color="yellow">I saw what they did during
my dad's funeral, so...</font>

196
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,000
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.
That's right.</font>

197
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,599
<font color="yellow">I was actually really
nervous back there.</font>

198
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,799
<font color="yellow">Right? Me too.
I was really nervous, too.</font>

199
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,299
<font color="yellow">Even though I never knew him.</font>

200
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:33,500
<font color="yellow">Yeah. This is the first
funeral I've ever attended.</font>

201
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,700
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

202
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sure one can even get used
to places like this, after a while.</font>

203
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm sure.</font>

204
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,099
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that a lot of people I know
will end up dying in my lifetime.</font>

205
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:48,000
<font color="yellow">- And we'll die one day, too--
- Stop it. This is depressing.</font>

206
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,599
<font color="yellow">- Sheesh, this--
- I told you, I'm not hot!</font>

207
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,700
<font color="yellow">I was going to talk about
this damn bus not coming!</font>

208
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,099
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

209
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jin Myung.</font>

210
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,599
<font color="yellow">Your mother is here.</font>

211
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,900
<font color="yellow">What time do you have to head back?</font>

212
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,400
<font color="yellow">Five.</font>

213
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,099
<font color="yellow">This is a great photo.</font>

214
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

215
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,799
<font color="yellow">It must've been hard for you,
preparing all this on your own.</font>

216
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,700
<font color="yellow">Why won't you meet with the attorney?</font>

217
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:48,500
<font color="yellow">I want to be punished
properly for my sins.</font>

218
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,400
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything wrong.</font>

219
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
<font color="yellow">Why did you even do it, if you were
going to be so remorseful?</font>

220
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
<font color="yellow">Why did you even do it?</font>

221
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,299
<font color="yellow">Mom, did you do this for me,
by any chance?</font>

222
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,299
<font color="yellow">Because you were afraid
that I'd do it, if you didn't?</font>

223
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,799
<font color="yellow">I feel like there's a weight
off my shoulders now.</font>

224
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,400
<font color="yellow">My sin is that I feel too
lighthearted after what I've done.</font>

225
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,099
<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't be acting this way
after I've killed my own child, but...</font>

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
<font color="yellow"><i>[Demian]</i></font>

227
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,799
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

228
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,599
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

229
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,400
<font color="yellow">it wasn't a proper funeral,
and it's not exactly good news.</font>

230
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,500
<font color="yellow">I wasn't exactly excited
to tell you about it.</font>

231
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,400
<font color="yellow">But still, it would've
been nice if you did.</font>

232
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,599
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.
I didn't tell anyone about it.</font>

233
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,700
<font color="yellow">Am I just "anyone" to you?</font>

234
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,599
<font color="yellow">- What I meant is--
- I thought...</font>

235
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,799
<font color="yellow">that I was a bit more
special to you than that.</font>

236
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:50,099
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, you make me quite sad.</font>

237
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:02,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. To tell you the truth,
I've been a bit weird lately.</font>

238
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what I should do.</font>

239
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,200
<font color="yellow">I feel like I've lost my way...</font>

240
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,799
<font color="yellow">but I don't even know
where I took a wrong turn.</font>

241
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,200
<font color="yellow"><i>So things with Senior Yoon
got resolved, for the most part.</i></font>

ah, whatever.</i></font>

out of the blue, though.</i></font>

246
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,400
<font color="yellow"><i>And I can't just act as if nothing
happened, since she heard it all.</i></font>

247
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,299
<font color="yellow"><i>The day after tomorrow.
So there's two days left.</i></font>

248
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I just confess?</i></font>

249
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,900
<font color="yellow"><i>What do I tell Mom?</i></font>

250
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Man, I'm so tired.</i></font>

251
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Living life diligently
sure is a lot of work.</i></font>

252
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I just quit?</i></font>

253
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,799
<font color="yellow"><i>What if I just keep trying my best,
but this isn't the right path for me?</i></font>

254
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,299
<font color="yellow"><i>Shouldn't I try to find a different goal
to work toward, as soon as possible?</i></font>

255
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,099
<font color="yellow"><i>Man, this is driving me crazy!
It's not like I'm going through puberty!</i></font>

256
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,599

to be when I grow up, at this age</i></font>

260
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,900

saying you've lost your way, and such.</i></font>

261
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,500
<font color="yellow"><i>And the issue with Mom will be
resolved better than I'd expected.</i></font>

lot better than before.</i></font>

bit left to do now, but...</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>What the heck? Thinking about it,
everyone here is weird in their own way.</i></font>

266

<font color="yellow"><i>Someone here almost died, while
another person had a comatose sibling</i></font>

nothing weird about her?</i></font>

I told you that I have?</font>

coming at you, but your dad saves you?</font>

286

saved me, back then?</font>

287
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,700

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,200
<font color="yellow">all you did is switch your mom's
and dad's tumblers. Right?</font>

290
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,000
<font color="yellow">Whatever was in those
tumblers is not your problem.</font>

291
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,200
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if there was poison
or sleeping medication in there.</font>

292
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,900
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with you,
since your dad did it. Right?</font>

293
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,200
<font color="yellow">You're innocent, even
in the worst case scenario.</font>

294
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,200
<font color="yellow">You just did that in order to protect
your mom and yourself.</font>

295
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,299
<font color="yellow">What else were you supposed
to do, in that situation?</font>

296
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,099
<font color="yellow">When I first heard your story,
I was a bit scared.</font>

297
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:08,099
<font color="yellow">But this is the conclusion I came to,
after thinking about it.</font>

298
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,799
<font color="yellow">So don't feel too guilty.
I'm sure everything will be okay.</font>

299
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,700
<font color="yellow">How will everything be okay?</font>

300
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,299
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they'll just look
into a couple of things.</font>

301
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,900
<font color="yellow">And if they do,
they might find out the truth.</font>

302
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that all my fearful
suspicions will be confirmed.</font>

303
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
<font color="yellow">About the car accident,
and our house burning down...</font>

304
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,099
<font color="yellow">and the reason why my brother died.</font>

305
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,799
<font color="yellow">My dad used to be really
nice to us until that fire.</font>

306
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,299
<font color="yellow">He was such a good dad.</font>

307
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,500
<font color="yellow">That's why I have to tell them
that I was so scared.</font>

308
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,799
<font color="yellow">I have to tell them that I haven't been
able to sleep properly since then.</font>

309
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,500
<font color="yellow">I have to tell them that the first thing
my dad did on the day my brother died</font>

310
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,599
<font color="yellow">was to wash the cup that my
brother last drank from.</font>

311
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,299
<font color="yellow">In order to expose the
fact that I'm not a murderer</font>

312
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,799
<font color="yellow">I have to say that my
dad was a murderer.</font>

313
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,799
<font color="yellow">Is that a good thing?</font>

314
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,799
<font color="yellow">My situation right now...</font>

315
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:26,799
<font color="yellow">feels kind of like Russian roulette,
with a fully loaded gun.</font>

316
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,099
<font color="yellow">This incident definitely
won't end well.</font>

317
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,200
<font color="yellow">I don't know why she's being so serious.</font>

318
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,599
<font color="yellow">Why were you hiding there?</font>

319
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,099
<font color="yellow">I wasn't hiding.
I'm just trying to water my plants!</font>

320
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:54,799
<font color="yellow">If she's playing Russian
roulette with a fully loaded gun</font>

321
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,299
<font color="yellow">she just doesn't have
to pull the trigger at all.</font>

322
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,200
<font color="yellow">You were eavesdropping!</font>

323
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,200
<font color="yellow">- Sung Min.
- Geez!</font>

324
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

325
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,700
<font color="yellow">- Let me ask you a favor.
- Don't.</font>

326
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,500
<font color="yellow">You're close with
Senior Sung Yeol, right?</font>

327
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,098
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not.
Who's Sung Yeol?</font>

328
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:38,200
<font color="yellow">You know, the Senior who
works at the Gookgwasoo (NISI)?</font>

329
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,298
<font color="yellow">What's the Gookgwasoo?</font>

330
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that an acronym for
Korean, Science, and Math?</font>

331
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
<font color="yellow">They're performing an autopsy
on a body from six years ago.</font>

332
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,700
<font color="yellow">How much can you find out about it?</font>

333
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,798
<font color="yellow">An autopsy?</font>

334
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
<font color="yellow">No, no. You take care of that.</font>

335
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,500
<font color="yellow">He won't pick up my calls
since last April!</font>

336
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,298
<font color="yellow">Figures. If he picked up your calls
after all your verbal abuse toward him</font>

337
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,598
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't be a mere mortal.
He'd be Buddha himself.</font>

338
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:02,500
<font color="yellow">I know, right? So please, Sung Min!
We're club buddies, right?</font>

339
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,700
<font color="yellow">- Please?
- What's with you?</font>

340
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like
a girl, all of a sudden?</font>

341
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,000
<font color="yellow">- Please, just once!
- Okay! Okay, so stop it.</font>

342
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
<font color="yellow">Find out by 6 p.m. today.</font>

343
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you giving me a deadline?
Him and I are both busy!</font>

344
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,000
<font color="yellow">I'll do it, okay? I'll do it.
So please, stop.</font>

345
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,098
<font color="yellow">Punk.</font>

346
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:39,000
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be back!</font>

347
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:51,000
<font color="yellow">Eun Jae!</font>

348
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
<font color="yellow">What brings you here, all of a sudden?</font>

349
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to see you.</font>

350
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, good! I really didn't want to work.
I'm going to use you as an excuse not to!</font>

351
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,200
<font color="yellow">Why? I'll feel bad toward Mister, then!</font>

352
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,298
<font color="yellow">There's just no end to this!
I don't want to work.</font>

353
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,700
<font color="yellow">Let's do it together.</font>

354
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,598
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- What?</font>

355
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,700
<font color="yellow">You have to be strong,
no matter what happens.</font>

356
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,598
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

357
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:32,000
<font color="yellow">Mom. You know...</font>

358
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,700
<font color="yellow">It's a snake! A snake!</font>

359
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
<font color="yellow">- Where? Where?
- Snake! Oh my gosh!</font>

360
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,000
<font color="yellow">- It's a snake! Right there!
- It's not a snake, Mom.</font>

361
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,200
<font color="yellow">It's not a snake, Mom.
It's not a snake!</font>

362
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,598
<font color="yellow">It's not?</font>

363
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:49,200
<font color="yellow">See? It's just a tree branch.</font>

364
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:54,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was so scared!
I was so scared!</font>

365
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,500
<font color="yellow">I saw a snake last time.</font>

366
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,000
<font color="yellow">Ugh, I hate snakes so much!
I'm scared of them the most!</font>

367
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,598
<font color="yellow">They're so, so scary!</font>

368
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:05,000
<font color="yellow">Ugh. Ugh!</font>

369
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of snakes, too.</font>

370
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,699
<font color="yellow">I hate snakes, and I'm
scared of them, too!</font>

371
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,699
<font color="yellow">You think you're the
only one who's scared?</font>

372
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,099
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?
Why do you always hide behind me?</font>

373
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,199
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to protect you
all the time?</font>

374
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,199
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to be the one
looking out for me, and protecting me!</font>

375
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,300
<font color="yellow">You're the mom!</font>

376
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,500
<font color="yellow">Eun... Eun Jae.</font>

377
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,699

that head of yours, is it?</font>

378
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,000
<font color="yellow">You're not worried about
anything, are you?</font>

379
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,699
<font color="yellow">You get to do all the good, nice things!</font>

380
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:36,800
<font color="yellow">Why? Why should I be the only
one worried, and full of doubt?</font>

381
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,699
<font color="yellow">Why do I...</font>

382
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,900
<font color="yellow">Eun... Eun Jae.</font>

383
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,300

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,599
<font color="yellow">And she doesn't talk much.</font>

433
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,900
<font color="yellow">She's always been like that.</font>

434
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,500
<font color="yellow">That's true, but...</font>

435
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,900
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

436
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,900
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? I'm getting really
worried because you're so serious.</font>

437
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,099
<font color="yellow">Remember how the insurance
claims investigator came by last time?</font>

438
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,800
<font color="yellow"><i>So when are the results of the
autopsy coming out, again?</i></font>

439
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,099
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow.</font>

440
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,199
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

441
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,099
<font color="yellow">I mean, um, what I mean is...</font>

442
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,199
<font color="yellow">I'm so in shock right now.</font>

443
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,199
<font color="yellow">This is quite a serious
situation, right?</font>

444
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,800
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

445
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,699
<font color="yellow">Hey, you idiot! Where are you?
What are you thinking, right now?</font>

446
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:13,699
<font color="yellow">Come home, right now.</font>

447
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:15,300
<font color="yellow">Come home, already!</font>

448
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,099
<font color="yellow">What should we do?
Should we report her missing?</font>

449
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,099
<font color="yellow">The cops won't do anything for us
even if we report her missing now.</font>

450
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:21,800
<font color="yellow">What do we do, then?</font>

451
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,500
<font color="yellow">You all are smart, aren't you?
Think of something!</font>

452
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,699
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go and look
around the neighborhood.</font>

453
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,099
<font color="yellow">- I can't just sit here idly.
- I'll come with you.</font>

454
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,300
<font color="yellow">I'll go to school
and look for her there.</font>

455
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,699
<font color="yellow">You're not going anywhere?</font>

456
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,800
<font color="yellow">At least one of us should stay at home.</font>

457
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,500
<font color="yellow">- Welcome!
- Hello.</font>

458
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,800
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming in!
- What?</font>

459
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,000
<font color="yellow">You're still a baby, aren't you?</font>

460
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
<font color="yellow">Do you have something you want to say?</font>

461
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,900
<font color="yellow">Um, hello.</font>

462
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,199
<font color="yellow">- Would you like a tangerine...
- Hey!</font>

463
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,500
<font color="yellow">Is the stuff in the washer yours?</font>

464
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,900
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and hang up your clothes!
I need to use it!</font>

465
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,500
<font color="yellow">Um, that is...</font>

466
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,300
<font color="yellow">- You said I could eat it.
- That was one time...</font>

467
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

468
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,300
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth, I was a bit
of an outcast in high school.</font>

469
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Well, no. More like, I had no friends.</i></font>

470
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I wanted to make friends and go to
fun places no matter what, in college.</i></font>

471
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,099
<font color="yellow">It's so hard for me,
that I feel like I'll die!</font>

472
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,800
<font color="yellow"><i>You could be a bit nice to me.</i></font>

473
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,900
<font color="yellow">You could be just a
little bit nice to me.</font>

474
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:22,000
<font color="yellow"><i>- My situation right now feels like...
- Eun Jae!</i></font>

475
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,199
<font color="yellow"><i>- I'm playing Russian roulette...</i>
- Try and kill me.</font>

476
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,199
<font color="yellow"><i>- with a fully loaded gun.</i>
- Eun Jae!</font>

477
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,699
<font color="yellow"><i>It'll end terribly, no matter what.</i></font>

478
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,699
<font color="yellow">I never knew how Eun Jae felt,
even though we live together.</font>

479
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,800
<font color="yellow">That makes me so upset!</font>

480
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't cry. It feels more
serious now that you're crying.</font>

481
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,500
<font color="yellow"><i>All right, please look over here.
Okay. Face forward!</i></font>

482
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,599
<font color="yellow">All right, get closer.
Okay. Good.</font>

483
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,099
<font color="yellow">- I bought chicken!
- Yay! Chicken!</font>

484
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:53,500
<font color="yellow"><i>When your brother passed away, your
family was in a bad place financially</i></font>

485
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,000
<font color="yellow"><i>and she collected insurance money
when your grandmother passed away, too.</i></font>

486
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,599
<font color="yellow"><i>There's a life insurance plan
in your name, too.</i></font>

487
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:06,599
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you know about that?</i></font>

488
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, you bitch!
Do you know how worried we were?</font>

489
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,300
<font color="yellow">I'm... sorry.</font>

490
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,300
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay now.</font>

491
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,800
<font color="yellow">It's okay now, because you're back.</font>

492
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,900
<font color="yellow">Drink it.</font>

493
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:42,599
<font color="yellow">So? Where were you?</font>

494
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:51,000
<font color="yellow">What? All night?</font>

495
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,599
<font color="yellow">You didn't get bit by any mosquitoes?</font>

496
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,300
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

497
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:02,099
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

498
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,699
<font color="yellow">Were you having suicidal thoughts?</font>

499
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,000
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

500
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:22,099
<font color="yellow">I was thinking that I should die,
and that there was no other way out.</font>

501
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,500
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

502
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,099
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to die, no matter
how much I thought about it.</font>

503
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:38,800
<font color="yellow">Why would you have to die?</font>

504
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,599
<font color="yellow">Yeah, live!
Don't die!</font>

505
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,599
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

506
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,900
<font color="yellow">if I think about what'll
happen from now on...</font>

507
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,699
<font color="yellow">We don't know what'll happen,
but don't worry about it in advance.</font>

508
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,300
<font color="yellow">You can deal with that issue
when the time comes.</font>

509
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:01,199
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I'll take your side,
no matter what happens!</font>

510
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,500
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

511
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,400
<font color="yellow">I'll take your side, even if everyone
else in the world thinks you're terrible.</font>

512
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,199
<font color="yellow">Man, I'm hungry.
Let's eat something!</font>

513
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,500
<font color="yellow">Yeah. None of us even
had dinner last night, right?</font>

514
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,900
<font color="yellow">Stay seated, Eun Jae.</font>

515
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:01,000
<font color="yellow">We all know about it, too,
so please go ahead.</font>

516
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,099
<font color="yellow">The results came out
yesterday afternoon.</font>

517
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,500
<font color="yellow">We're sorry.</font>

518
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,400
<font color="yellow">The toxicology report
revealed to us that...</font>

519
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
<font color="yellow">there was no foul play involved.</font>

520
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,300
<font color="yellow">Let me apologize one more time
for taking such drastic measures.</font>

521
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry.</font>

522
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,500
<font color="yellow"><i>What happened?</i></font>

523
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,599
<font color="yellow">How old did you say that you were then?</font>

524
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,000
<font color="yellow">I was in eighth grade.</font>

525
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,900
<font color="yellow">And what about when your
older brother died?</font>

526
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,400
<font color="yellow">I was in fourth grade.</font>

527
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:42,900
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that there was no
misunderstanding on your part?</font>

528
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:50,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

529
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:55,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah. You were in your teens. You said
you couldn't sleep for a while, right?</font>

530
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,000
<font color="yellow">You probably just
misunderstood something.</font>

531
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,099
<font color="yellow">What the... you idiot!</font>

532
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,300
<font color="yellow">Then you were worrying so much
about nothing, all this time?</font>

533
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,199
<font color="yellow">Maybe the autopsy wasn't detailed?</font>

534
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:17,500
<font color="yellow">So if there was no reagent,
they're not guilty?</font>

535
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

536
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,000
<font color="yellow">So even the autopsy can't
reveal a lot of details, huh?</font>

537
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:25,800
<font color="yellow">No, it is.</font>

538
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,800
<font color="yellow">I looked into it through
a senior that I know</font>

539
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,000
<font color="yellow">and there aren't any poisons or chemicals
that go undetected by an autopsy.</font>

540
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:37,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I'm sure you just
misunderstood something.</font>

541
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,599
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

542
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,300
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

543
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,599
<font color="yellow">Come on, smile!</font>

544
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:21,699
<font color="yellow"><i>She does look pretty, on the surface.</i></font>

545
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:23,900
<font color="yellow"><i>She does have some
cuteness about her, too.</i></font>

546
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,699
<font color="yellow"><i>And we have good conversations.</i></font>

547
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:35,300
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you going in?
Is something the matter?</font>

548
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:40,099
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

549
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:42,300
<font color="yellow">what I did was for the best?</font>

550
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,000
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

551
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,400
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I don't
want to talk about it.</font>

552
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,000
<font color="yellow">Hey. Just tell me.
You'll end up telling me anyway.</font>

553
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,900
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

554
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,800
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're scaring me!
Do you have a fever?</font>

555
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,199
<font color="yellow">Geez, why are you getting
so close? Go away.</font>

556
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,699
<font color="yellow">You want to tell me, right?
You want to tell me so bad, right?</font>

557
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:12,000
<font color="yellow">Just tell me!</font>

558
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,300
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep silent,
starting today.</font>

559
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,500
<font color="yellow">Why? You're the... prettiest
when you're blabbering on.</font>

560
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,900
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

561
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,599
<font color="yellow">Really, now?</font>

562
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,400
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

563
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

564
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I just had a super crazy thought
about you, for just a moment.</i></font>

565
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,099
<font color="yellow">- How did you know?
- About what?</font>

566
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
<font color="yellow">It didn't smell, or make any sounds!
Wow, you sure are impressive!</font>

567
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you just fart, too?</i></font>

568
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,099
<font color="yellow">You should be a detective that
specializes in drug cases!</font>

569
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,900
<font color="yellow">You have a gift!</font>

570
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,099
<font color="yellow">This is something that
happened to a painter.</font>

571
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:58,199
<font color="yellow">Their dad told them they were the first
one to discover their mom's corpse.</font>

572
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,800
<font color="yellow">When he said that, they were able to
remember the scene from that morning</font>

573
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,000
<font color="yellow">even though they'd forgotten it.</font>

574
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,099
<font color="yellow">Their mother drowned to death.</font>

575
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,599
<font color="yellow">And they remembered her
long hair strewn all about the water</font>

576
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,699
<font color="yellow">and they remembered the
scene from that morning clearly</font>
