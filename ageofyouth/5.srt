30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,200

bargain hunter and bought a bad bulb.</font>

39

56

wisdom of our ancestors?</font>

65
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,200
<font color="yellow">You know, our ancestors used to put
phallic objects near haunted places.</font>

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,600
<font color="yellow">Why, you ask?</font>

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,200
<font color="yellow">Because ghosts are "yin,"
and the phallus is "yang."</font>

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
<font color="yellow">Really? Is that really true?</font>

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've read about that in a book.</font>

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,500
<font color="yellow">That's why we should put phallic
objects all around our place--</font>

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700

over the place, we can invite real men.</font>

be better than just a cucumber.</font>

84
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,890
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

85
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,500
<font color="yellow">Why not? You can't break up with him?</font>

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,390

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,300

381
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,990
<font color="yellow">If you don't bring a man,
I'm going to punish you.</font>

<font color="yellow">That's not fair!</font>

383
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,700
<font color="yellow">So bring a man, then!</font>

384
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,100

are you going to give us?</font>

389
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,900

392
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,900
<font color="yellow">Why don't we each write
out a punishment, then?</font>

393
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,490
<font color="yellow">We'll each write one, and then
you can pick one at random.</font>

394
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,700
<font color="yellow">That's okay, right?</font>

395
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,990

stupid stuff, though.</font>

I get used to riding it.</font>

444
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
<font color="yellow">Hmph.</font>

445
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,100
<font color="yellow">It must be time.
Let's go.</font>

446
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,600
<font color="yellow"><i>Breaking up with
someone means that</i></font>

447
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,490
<font color="yellow"><i>even if something good happens,
you can't be happy together.</i></font>

448
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:24,990
<font color="yellow"><i>And that you can't worry about them,
even if something bad happens.</i></font>

449
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,490
<font color="yellow"><i>The fact that you've broken
up with someone means that</i></font>

450
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,490
<font color="yellow"><i>you can no longer be
curious about each other.</i></font>

451
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,100
<font color="yellow"><i>The fact that you've broken
up with someone means that</i></font>

452
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,700
<font color="yellow"><i>the future that you'd imagined,
with you being alongside them</i></font>

453
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,100
<font color="yellow"><i>is something that you must give up on.</i></font>

454
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,900
<font color="yellow">Um... do Nutrition majors cook, too?</font>

455
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

456
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,200
<font color="yellow">What kinds of things
are you good at cooking?</font>

457
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,490
<font color="yellow">Spicy stewed chicken
and potatoes.</font>

458
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,600
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

459
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,290
<font color="yellow">Is spicy stewed chicken and
potatoes a sad dish, or something?</font>

460
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,990
<font color="yellow">You're the one who asked me to
introduce you to some new guys!</font>

461
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, after I went through
the trouble of bringing them here?</font>

462
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,990
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

463
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,200
<font color="yellow">Smile a little.
Okay?</font>

464
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.
Got it.</font>

465
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,700
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

466
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,600
<font color="yellow">are you doing on Saturday?</font>

467
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,290
<font color="yellow">All right, smile for me a little!
One, two!</font>

468
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,200
<font color="yellow">Wow, you look so cool!
Just a sec. One more time!</font>

469
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,990
<font color="yellow">All right. Put on an expression
that conveys victory!</font>

470
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,600
<font color="yellow">One, two!</font>

471
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,900
<font color="yellow">- Yes! Good work, everyone!
- Thank you!</font>

472
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,200
<font color="yellow">Good work. Also, if you need to get
in touch with me, here's my information.</font>

473
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,700
<font color="yellow">And if you'd like a copy of the photo,
please let me know! I'll send it to you.</font>

474
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
<font color="yellow">- Okay? I'll send it to you.
- All right.</font>

475
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,200
<font color="yellow">Please get in touch!</font>

476
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,100
<font color="yellow">Also, what are all of you
doing tomorrow?</font>

477
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
<font color="yellow">- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?</font>

478
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, um, it's because there's going to
be a small party at my place tomorrow.</font>

479
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
<font color="yellow">If any of you have time,
come and stop by!</font>

480
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,990
<font color="yellow">- Wow!
- Wow!</font>

481
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,900
<font color="yellow">How are they having trouble
with something so simple?</font>

482
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

483
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,890
<font color="yellow">What are you doing this Saturday night?</font>

484
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,790
<font color="yellow">We're going to have a party at my place.</font>

485
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,100
<font color="yellow">Would you like to come?</font>

486
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,500
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

487
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,600
<font color="yellow">Senior...</font>

488
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,100
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

489
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,500
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

490
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,100
<font color="yellow">You sure looked like you
were having a jolly old time.</font>

491
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
<font color="yellow">I wonder what's on your mind?</font>

492
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

493
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,000
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask you.</font>

494
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,600
<font color="yellow">If I don't bring a guy, I'll have to
face a really scary punishment.</font>

495
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,890
<font color="yellow">But, I don't know anyone in Seoul.</font>

496
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,390
<font color="yellow">So could you come, Senior?
I'd really appreciate it.</font>

497
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,200
<font color="yellow">That's what you want me
to tell that guy, right?</font>

498
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,500
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

499
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,700
<font color="yellow">So you want me to ask that,
to that creep over there?</font>

500
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,000
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

501
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
<font color="yellow">Well, um, he's not creepy.</font>

502
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,500
<font color="yellow">Wow, Yoon Jong Yeol.
How did you end up in this mess?</font>

503
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,000
<font color="yellow">You little!</font>

504
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,200
<font color="yellow">That's not right, right?
Yes, that's not right.</font>

505
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,000
<font color="yellow">Just forget about it.</font>

506
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
<font color="yellow">I'll ask him myself.</font>

507
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,100
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to him.</font>

508
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,790
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Huh?</font>

509
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,890
<font color="yellow">I'll do it, damn it!</font>

510
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, Yool Bin.</font>

511
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jong Yeol.</font>

512
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,890
<font color="yellow">You know, a summer sunset
is like a young girl's sigh.</font>

513
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,200
<font color="yellow">You can shove that bullshit
right back up your ass.</font>

514
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
<font color="yellow">Anyway, um...</font>

515
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,700
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

516
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,000
<font color="yellow">Do-you-have-time
-tomorrow-night-by-any-chance?</font>

517
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

518
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,600
<font color="yellow">Um, Yoon-Jae-said-that-she...</font>

519
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,100
<font color="yellow">wanted-you-at-her-party.</font>

520
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,290
<font color="yellow">You know?</font>

521
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,000
<font color="yellow">You don't understand what I'm saying?</font>

522
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
<font color="yellow">No. Not at all.</font>

523
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,890
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jong Yeol.</font>

524
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,200
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

525
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,290
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

526
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,200
<font color="yellow">Just keep appreciating
that sunset, all right, Yool Bin?</font>

527
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,600
<font color="yellow">You know. Your sunsets
and sighs, and whatnot.</font>

528
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,500
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.
I know what you're going to say.</font>

529
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,890
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

530
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,890
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Yes?</font>

531
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,390
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like that?
Square your shoulders!</font>

532
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

533
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,000
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

534
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,700
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

535
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,100
<font color="yellow">Geez, you little brat!</font>

536
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,290
<font color="yellow">Let's go! I'll buy you a drink.</font>

537
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,890
<font color="yellow">Pace yourself.</font>

538
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

539
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,890
<font color="yellow">He was my first love.</font>

540
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, what do you mean, "love?"</font>

541
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,890
<font color="yellow">Love, my ass!</font>

542
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,100
<font color="yellow">You weren't even close to love!</font>

543
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,200
<font color="yellow">It was love!</font>

544
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,290
<font color="yellow">He's the first guy that I've ever loved!</font>

545
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,500
<font color="yellow">Hey! You never even had a crush
on your teacher, or anything like that?</font>

546
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,390
<font color="yellow">It's okay.
It'll get better.</font>

547
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,000
<font color="yellow">No. It'll never become okay.</font>

548
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,790
<font color="yellow">You'll forget about it, with time.</font>

549
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,390
<font color="yellow">No, I won't.</font>

550
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,500
<font color="yellow">I told you, you'll forget
about it really quickly!</font>

551
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,390
<font color="yellow">How do you know, Senior?</font>

552
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,200
<font color="yellow">That's how love is.</font>

553
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,700
<font color="yellow">Though one can't call your
meager feelings love.</font>

554
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,390
<font color="yellow">You know that much about love?</font>

555
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,200
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I do.
I know about it very well.</font>

556
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,200
<font color="yellow">Well, how many times have
you been in love?</font>

557
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,790
<font color="yellow">Tons of times.
Hey.</font>

558
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,200
<font color="yellow">It wasn't just once or twice.</font>

559
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,500
<font color="yellow">You know, I...</font>

560
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,200
<font color="yellow">How nice!</font>

561
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,290
<font color="yellow">Hey, what did you like so much
about that punk, anyway?</font>

562
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,000
<font color="yellow">Everything.</font>

563
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,290
<font color="yellow">His looks, his voice...</font>

564
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,600
<font color="yellow">The way he talks,
the way he smiles...</font>

565
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,000
<font color="yellow">His name is so cool, too.</font>

566
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,000
<font color="yellow">Shin Yool Bin!</font>

567
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,200
<font color="yellow">Senior Yool Bin!</font>

568
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,390
<font color="yellow">Yool Bin-oppa!</font>

569
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,000
<font color="yellow">What a load of bull.</font>

570
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,500
<font color="yellow">I even planned names for
our future children!</font>

571
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
<font color="yellow">I was going to name them
Na Ra if they were a girl</font>

572
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,290
<font color="yellow">and Sae Gae if they were a boy!</font>

573
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,390
<font color="yellow">Damn, just how far did your
imagination take you?</font>

574
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,700
<font color="yellow">It's all over!</font>

575
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,500
<font color="yellow">It's all over!</font>

576
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,000
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

577
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, crap.</font>

578
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,200
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

579
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,290
<font color="yellow">What do I do?
I'm going to get punished.</font>

580
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,500
<font color="yellow">What's the punishment?</font>

581
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,700
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

582
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,500
<font color="yellow">Wow. So, what are you going to do?</font>

583
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,290
<font color="yellow">You're in deep trouble now.</font>

584
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,100
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

585
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,390
<font color="yellow">I'll have to get a part-time job,
or something.</font>

586
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,500
<font color="yellow">I'll probably get paid hourly, right?</font>

587
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,200
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why are you trying to solve
everything with money?</font>

588
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,100
<font color="yellow">That's a terrible habit.</font>

589
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,600
<font color="yellow">If you really need me to,
I'll come to your party.</font>

590
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,390
<font color="yellow">You?
But, why?</font>

591
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:07,200
<font color="yellow">Just because.
I feel bad for you.</font>

592
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,390
<font color="yellow">Could you, then?</font>

593
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,500
<font color="yellow">What's with your reaction?</font>

594
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,600
<font color="yellow">Oh.
Thank you.</font>

595
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,390
<font color="yellow">What will you do for me if I go?</font>

596
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,000
<font color="yellow">I have to do something for you?</font>

597
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
<font color="yellow">See a movie with me,
and pay for the tickets.</font>

598
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
<font color="yellow">Three times.</font>

599
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,290
<font color="yellow">I'll just find a part-time job.</font>

600
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,290
<font color="yellow">Paying for three movies, plus
transportation, is over 50,000 won...</font>

601
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,600
<font color="yellow">I'll pay.
Happy?</font>

602
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,290
<font color="yellow">But, why?</font>

603
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,700
<font color="yellow">Think of it as "community service."</font>

604
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,890
<font color="yellow">Happy now, you idiot?</font>

605
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,500
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

606
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!
One more bottle of soju, please!</font>

607
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,200
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

608
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,290
<font color="yellow">Wow! You did all of this yourself?</font>

609
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,390
<font color="yellow">- Yeah. How do you like it?
- Wow!</font>

610
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,200
<font color="yellow">It's freaking amazing.
What about Jung, and our youngest?</font>

611
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,890
<font color="yellow">They're not home yet?</font>

612
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,000
<font color="yellow">- They're sleeping.
- Those little!</font>

613
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,100
<font color="yellow">How dare they not help out!</font>

614
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,500
<font color="yellow">What's with your attitude,
when you're the youngest, huh?</font>

615
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,000
<font color="yellow">Did she drink?</font>

616
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,700
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

617
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,500
<font color="yellow">Well, if it's because of alcohol,
it can't be helped.</font>

618
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,000
<font color="yellow">Madame Jung!
What are you doing?</font>

619
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,790
<font color="yellow">Did you drink, too?</font>

620
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,890
<font color="yellow"><i>[The Day of the Party]</i></font>

621
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,100
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

622
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,290
<font color="yellow">Hey, how many guys are
on the basketball team?</font>

623
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,890
<font color="yellow">Five?</font>

624
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,000
<font color="yellow">Twelve, including the people
who are on the bench.</font>

625
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, if twelve people from the
basketball team come to our place...</font>

626
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,290
<font color="yellow">that'd be totally awesome!</font>

627
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,000
<font color="yellow">- Do you think this is enough alcohol?
- Of course not!</font>

628
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,200
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

629
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,890
<font color="yellow">Evil bastard! See?
He didn't even text us once!</font>

630
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,000
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because he's so sorry
that he hasn't been in touch?</font>

631
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,500
<font color="yellow">Hmph! Either way,
he hasn't been in touch!</font>

632
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
<font color="yellow">It's over!
It's! Over!</font>

633
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,100
<font color="yellow">It's okay, it's okay!</font>

634
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,790
<font color="yellow">Even if it's hard now, this will be
a good memory down the line!</font>

635
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,390
<font color="yellow">It's a core memory for First Love-Land!</font>

636
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,890
<font color="yellow">Did that guy...
really ever love me?</font>

637
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,390
<font color="yellow">Senior Jung.</font>

638
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,290
<font color="yellow">Ugh.
I wrote it wrong.</font>

639
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,600
<font color="yellow">Are you guys done?</font>

640
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,100
<font color="yellow">There will be 12 guys from the
basketball team, plus three more guys.</font>

641
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,000
<font color="yellow">So I'm sure that I'll be able to
score with one of those 15 guys.</font>

642
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,600
<font color="yellow">Just choose a guy among that group.</font>

643
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,700
<font color="yellow">You need to use a man
to get over another man!</font>

644
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,290
<font color="yellow">Here, you try!</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Dad]</i></font>

646
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,390
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Why?</font>

647
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,500
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are all swollen.</font>

648
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,200
<font color="yellow">Come on, why are you
making her cry again?</font>

649
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,100
<font color="yellow">No crying!
Stop!</font>

650
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
<font color="yellow">You're even worse!</font>

651
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,600
<font color="yellow">And why are you crying, now?</font>

652
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,500
<font color="yellow">Because Senior Jung is crying.</font>

653
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,790
<font color="yellow">It's hard now because you loved him.</font>

654
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,500
<font color="yellow">If you were fine after you parted ways,
that'd be even weirder!</font>

655
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,890
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't try to sympathize
with her, with that kind of voice.</font>

656
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,700
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon!</font>

doing this with us, too!</font>

<font color="yellow">Can't you skip work, just for today?</font>

659
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
<font color="yellow">I'll call in sick for you.</font>

660
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,890
<font color="yellow">With that voice?</font>

661
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,790
<font color="yellow">I don't have as much free
time as all of you do.</font>

662
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,390
<font color="yellow">If you're not teasing me,
stop it already.</font>

663
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,290
<font color="yellow">I wasn't trying to tease her.</font>

664
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,500
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry toward Senior Yoon.</font>

665
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:13,290
<font color="yellow">I know, right? I feel guilty, and that
we might be inconveniencing her.</font>

666
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,500
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Student.</font>

667
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
<font color="yellow">Do you know where this may be?</font>

668
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,700
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

669
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,200
<font color="yellow"><i>[Seoul Mapo-gu, Donggo-dong,

<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

671
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,290
<font color="yellow">Go straight down this road</font>

672
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,700
<font color="yellow">and then make a right turn at the
intersection with no streetlights.</font>

673
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,100
<font color="yellow">- I see.
- Um, are you, by any chance...</font>

674
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,000
<font color="yellow">Song Ji Won's...</font>

675
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, you know my Ji Won, too?</font>

676
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,700
<font color="yellow">What's with this
"Night of Males," anyway?</font>

677
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,100
<font color="yellow">For example, if you called it "Night
of Females," it'd sound weird!</font>

678
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,390
<font color="yellow">Really? It's kind of a
weird name, isn't it?</font>

679
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,390
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

680
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,000
<font color="yellow">Should we change the name to "The
Night of Male Energy Rejuvenation," then?</font>

681
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,890
<font color="yellow">They're both weird.</font>

682
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,890
<font color="yellow">Where do I keep hearing this noise from?</font>

683
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,700
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

684
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,200
<font color="yellow">What the... why are there
so many missed calls?</font>

685
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,200
<font color="yellow">Dad?</font>

686
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

687
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, Senior Yoon?</font>

688
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,500
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

689
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,000
<font color="yellow">Senior Song's dad is coming.</font>

690
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

691
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,390
<font color="yellow">- My dad is coming!
- What?</font>

692
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,890
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on!
Hide this stuff!</font>

693
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,890
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's not him!</font>

694
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry if I stopped you
when you're busy.</font>

695
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,790
<font color="yellow">No, it's all right.</font>

696
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,890
<font color="yellow">Move!</font>

697
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,890
<font color="yellow">- It's this way.
- Oh, really?</font>

698
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,700
<font color="yellow">Hey! You, Eun Jae's man!
Move the sofa!</font>

699
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,390
<font color="yellow">- You mean me?
- He's not my man.</font>

700
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,200
<font color="yellow">- Hurry!
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

701
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,290
<font color="yellow">Where should I move this?</font>

702
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,000
<font color="yellow">Over there!</font>

703
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,100
<font color="yellow">Are you going to
graduate soon, Student?</font>

704
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,890
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I see.</font>

705
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,890
<font color="yellow">So you're older than Ji Won, eh?</font>

706
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,890
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

707
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,700
<font color="yellow">Yes. Since you're older than Ji Won,
please look after her.</font>

708
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,200
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know anything
about the world, you see.</font>

709
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,290
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

710
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,700
<font color="yellow">It's because she's a country bumpkin.</font>

711
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,200
<font color="yellow">She can't say a word anywhere she goes,
and is the embodiment of innocence!</font>

712
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,700
<font color="yellow">Senior, help me with this!</font>

713
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,600
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

714
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,290
<font color="yellow">- Help me with this, too!
- Okay!</font>

715
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,700
<font color="yellow">Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!</font>

716
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,390
<font color="yellow">We're here, sir.</font>

717
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, this is it?</font>

718
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:04,100
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm so sorry.
You seem so busy, too.</font>

719
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,100
<font color="yellow">You can go now.</font>

720
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,700
<font color="yellow">- It's all right. Go on.
- Okay.</font>

721
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,700
<font color="yellow">It's really him this time.</font>

722
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,000
<font color="yellow">It's really him this time!</font>

723
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,500
<font color="yellow">Ji Won!</font>

724
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,890
<font color="yellow">- Hurry!
- Hurry!</font>

725
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,890
<font color="yellow">Got it!</font>

726
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,700
<font color="yellow">Move, hurry!</font>

727
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,890
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- Over there!</font>

728
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,100
<font color="yellow">- Here?
- Yes!</font>

729
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,890
<font color="yellow">Wait, why me?</font>

730
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,500
<font color="yellow">Ji Won!
Ji Won!</font>

731
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,790
<font color="yellow">- Everything is ready, right?
- Yeah.</font>

732
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,890
<font color="yellow">Dad! Sorry, I kept you waiting.</font>

733
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,200
<font color="yellow">What took so long?
Oh, who's this?</font>

734
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,890
<font color="yellow">- Please accept my bow!
- Oh, yes!</font>

735
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,390
<font color="yellow">- Please accept one more!
- Senior Kang!</font>

736
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,290
<font color="yellow">It was hard to get here, right?</font>

737
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,390
<font color="yellow">- Oh, kimchi!
- Is this for me?</font>

738
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,790
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's kimchi.</font>

739
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,100
<font color="yellow">- It's hot, right? Come in!
- Please, come in!</font>

740
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,890
<font color="yellow">Your mom spent all morning
