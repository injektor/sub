<font color="yellow"><i>There was once a time
when I longed to be special.</i></font>

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,940
<font color="yellow"><i>I believed that I had a
special fate in store for me</i></font>

00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,050
<font color="yellow"><i>and that my life would be
different than that of others.</i></font>

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,440
<font color="yellow"><i>I told myself that I wouldn't end up
becoming average, no matter what.</i></font>

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,940
<font color="yellow"><i>To be average means to be comfortable.</i></font>

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,440
<font color="yellow"><i>To be average means
to not catch anyone's eye.</i></font>

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="yellow"><i>To be average means to be boring.</i></font>

10
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,350
<font color="yellow"><i>To tell me then that I was
average was a direct insult.</i></font>

11
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,640
<font color="yellow">I was curious if what you wanted
after working so hard</font>

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,950
<font color="yellow">was to work at a mere company.</font>

13
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,140
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah. I'm going to work at a company.</i></font>

14
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,240
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm going to try my damnedest,
just to become average.</i></font>

15
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,450
<font color="yellow">I told you to wait in the lobby.</font>

16
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,640
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

17
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,850
<font color="yellow">Sorry for inconveniencing you.</font>

18
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,550
<font color="yellow">You can go now.</font>

19
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,550
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

20
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,350
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm even less than average right now.</i></font>

My Dream is to Work at A Company]</i></font>

22
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,050
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

23
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,950
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Bye, Senior!</font>

24
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,240
<font color="yellow">Ah, Friday. The day of the week
that makes Senior Yoon crap out blood.</font>

25
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,950
<font color="yellow">Ew, why do you have to put it like that?</font>

26
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,850
<font color="yellow">What can I say?
It's a talent.</font>

27
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,850
<font color="yellow">Just how many part-time jobs
does Senior Yoon have?</font>

28
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,850
<font color="yellow">There's probably three
that she does full-time.</font>

29
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,740
<font color="yellow">Not including the ones she
only does occasionally.</font>

30
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,740
<font color="yellow">Goodbye!</font>

31
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,640
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

32
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,850
<font color="yellow">- Um...
- You're already done?</font>

33
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,050
<font color="yellow">Wow, that was quick.</font>

34
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,050
<font color="yellow">- Well, goodbye.
- Wait, wait!</font>

35
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,940
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, why are you always so busy?</font>

36
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,550
<font color="yellow">I made this to give to you, Teacher.</font>

37
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,850
<font color="yellow">What container should I put this in?</font>

38
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,550
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

39
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,850
<font color="yellow">You said that you don't live
with your parents, right?</font>

40
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,850
<font color="yellow">It must be so hard to
get a good square meal!</font>

41
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,650
<font color="yellow">Here, take it.</font>

42
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,550
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

43
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,650
<font color="yellow">Thank you.
I'll enjoy it.</font>

44
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,940
<font color="yellow">Does she only work at the
restaurant on weekends?</font>

45
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,350
<font color="yellow">No. She works there from Friday
to Sunday, so three days a week.</font>

46
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,350
<font color="yellow">All right, let's eat!</font>

47
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,740
<font color="yellow">- Here, a plate!
- Here.</font>

48
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
<font color="yellow">All right!</font>

49
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Friday to Sunday is when
restaurants are busiest, though.</i></font>

50
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,850
<font color="yellow">I know someone who used to work part-
time at a restaurant at that time slot.</font>

51
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,150
<font color="yellow">She didn't last a month.
Her body couldn't keep up.</font>

52
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,850
<font color="yellow">And she's the manager of a gym, too!</font>

53
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,850
<font color="yellow">But Senior Yoon's being doing
that for two whole years.</font>

54
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,650
<font color="yellow">You don't see many people
like her these days.</font>

55
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,740
<font color="yellow">She'd probably take
just about any type of job.</font>

56
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, this is fun.</font>

57
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
<font color="yellow">I told you, this is the best thing
to do to pass time!</font>

58
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,740
<font color="yellow">Hey, pass me the yellow.</font>

59
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,940
<font color="yellow">But why does she work the graveyard
shift at the convenience store?</font>

60
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,550
<font color="yellow">Isn't it dangerous?</font>

61
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,050
<font color="yellow">And there aren't many people
who come in, either.</font>

62
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, does she get paid more for that?</font>

63
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,550
<font color="yellow">No, the pay is the same.</font>

64
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,650
<font color="yellow">She does that so she can study at work.</font>

65
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,550
<font color="yellow">And there's not many
customers during that shift.</font>

66
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,850
<font color="yellow">How much money do you think
Senior Yoon makes per month?</font>

67
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's say that she gets 300,000 won
per month from tutoring.</i></font>

68
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,940
<font color="yellow"><i>She only earns that much from tutoring?</i></font>

69
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,240
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought she earned a lot
of money from that job.</i></font>

70
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Tutors don't get paid much these days.</i></font>

71
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,940
<font color="yellow"><i>So 300,000 won from tutoring. And the
restaurant job pays 7,000 won hourly.</i></font>

72
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,850
<font color="yellow"><i>So... she probably gets 400,000 won
from that job per month.</i></font>

73
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,150
<font color="yellow"><i>She works at the convenience store
for 6 hours, 5 days a week. So 30 hours.</i></font>

74
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,940
<font color="yellow"><i>And assuming she gets minimum wage,
that's about 720,000 won per month.</i></font>

75
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,440
<font color="yellow"><i>So in total, she makes about
1.4 million won per month.</i></font>

76
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,740
<font color="yellow">Wow, 1.4 million won?</font>

77
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,850
<font color="yellow">That's probably less than
Senior Kang gets from one lover, though.</font>

78
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,650
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

79
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,940
<font color="yellow">How much does Senior Kang get?</font>

80
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,550
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that Senior Kang gets at
least 2 to 3 million won per month.</font>

81
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,550
<font color="yellow">Let's make some calculations.</font>

82
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,850
<font color="yellow">The world has lost its
damn mind, I tell you!</font>

83
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,550
<font color="yellow">- We'll be going home now, Manager!
- All right. Goodbye.</font>

84
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,840
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- Thank you for your hard work.</font>

85
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being late.</font>

86
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,550
<font color="yellow">- Why were you late?
- I'm sorry.</font>

87
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,840
<font color="yellow">Make sure it doesn't happen again.</font>

88
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

89
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,440
<font color="yellow">Let's go.
You'll miss the bus.</font>

90
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

91
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,050
<font color="yellow">Don't be nice to me.</font>

92
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,340
<font color="yellow">If you're nice to me, and
then stop being nice to me</font>

93
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,440
<font color="yellow">it'll be even harder on me.</font>

94
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,050
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be okay if I just continued
being nice to you, then?</font>

95
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,150
<font color="yellow">I can be nice to you, right?</font>

96
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,150
<font color="yellow">Um, this is my place.</font>

97
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,440
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

98
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,940
<font color="yellow">How are you going to get home?
The last bus already left.</font>

99
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,440
<font color="yellow">Well, I can just go to
the sauna up front.</font>

100
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,050
<font color="yellow">Go inside now.</font>

101
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,940
<font color="yellow">You're being foolish.</font>

102
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,550
<font color="yellow">Hmph. All you had to say
was "thank you."</font>

103
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,050
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

104
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,340
<font color="yellow">- You're back, Senior Yoon?
- You're home, Senior Yoon?</font>

105
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,440
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

106
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,050
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

107
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,940
<font color="yellow">Oh no!
Are you okay?</font>

108
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,550
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

109
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,440
<font color="yellow">Um, do you have a form of ID,
like a student ID?</font>

110
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,250
<font color="yellow">Um, it's just because there was someone
who lied about being a college student.</font>

111
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,050
<font color="yellow">It's good to be sure.</font>

112
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,250
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

113
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,940
<font color="yellow">I heard that you already live
in another house with roommates.</font>

114
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,250
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to leave that place?</font>

115
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,250
<font color="yellow">Well, the people are all nice,
but they don't really clean...</font>

116
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,940
<font color="yellow">Figures. That's what roommates
tend to argue about the most.</font>

117
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,940
<font color="yellow">When you see someone half-assing it
when you're putting your all into it</font>

118
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,550
<font color="yellow">- it pisses me off.
- Exactly!</font>

119
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,940
<font color="yellow">One should keep the living room
and bathroom area clean, right?</font>

120
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,550
<font color="yellow">They're shared spaces, after all.</font>

121
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,150
<font color="yellow">Exactly!</font>

122
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,840
<font color="yellow">The people I lived with only cleaned
the bathroom once a week!</font>

123
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

124
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,940
<font color="yellow">And they only cleaned it for 30 minutes!</font>

125
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,750
<font color="yellow">How can you call that cleaning? That's
just dousing things down with water!</font>

126
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,340
<font color="yellow">Well, what could I expect from people</font>

127
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,340
<font color="yellow">who wash their underwear
with their normal clothes, anyway?</font>

128
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,650
<font color="yellow">Abracadabra!</font>

129
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,940
<font color="yellow">It seems like there's something
going on with Senior Yoon.</font>

130
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

131
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,340
<font color="yellow">She's drinking beer by herself
on the balcony.</font>

132
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,550
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

133
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,150
<font color="yellow">It's Sunday night. Senior Yoon
always has a beer on Sunday nights.</font>

134
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,550
<font color="yellow">You didn't know that?</font>

135
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,840
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

136
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Stop it!</i></font>

137
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,250
<font color="yellow">Ow!
Hey!</font>

138
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,340
<font color="yellow">If you went on a retreat, you
should've just spent time bonding.</font>

139
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,950
<font color="yellow">How dare you lock eyes with a guy!</font>

140
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,950
<font color="yellow">- No, it wasn't like that!
- You sure talk back a lot, sinner!</font>

141
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,950
<font color="yellow">- Spill everything, now!
- You think we won't get it out of you?</font>

142
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,250
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon, please stop them!</font>

143
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,950
<font color="yellow">What kind of guy is he?</font>

144
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,950
<font color="yellow">She asked you what kind of
guy he is, sinner!</font>

145
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,250
<font color="yellow">- Hey, it's really nice here!
- Yeah!</font>

146
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,840
<font color="yellow">- Wait, that's our group's!
- I know.</font>

147
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,450
<font color="yellow">- Give that back!
- I'll hold it for you.</font>

148
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,140
<font color="yellow">It's fine!</font>

149
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,840
<font color="yellow">You're probably going to
tease me somehow, later.</font>

150
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,840
<font color="yellow">Fine! You hold it then.
Here, hold everything!</font>

151
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
<font color="yellow">Idiot.</font>

152
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you talking about the Senior that
we saw at the cafeteria last time?</i></font>

153
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

154
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,750
<font color="yellow">He always teases me, harasses me,
and says that I'm ugly!</font>

155
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,750
<font color="yellow">That's why I have to be wary of him.</font>

156
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,700
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

157
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,450
<font color="yellow">Well, if it's not that guy,
then who is it?</font>

158
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,550
<font color="yellow">Oh my, my. Carrying all that,
with your thin arms?</font>

159
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,450
<font color="yellow">This should be taken care of
by us guys.</font>

160
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,340
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful enough
that you came at all.</font>

161
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,450
<font color="yellow">So I definitely can't allow you
to carry all that.</font>

162
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,140
<font color="yellow">Give it here.</font>

163
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Wait a second.</i></font>

164
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,550
<font color="yellow">So the guy that you like
isn't that first guy?</font>

165
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,550
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

166
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,750
<font color="yellow">So... you like that second guy?</font>

167
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,550
<font color="yellow">The guy who was all like, "Oh my, my.
How could they make a girl carry that?"</font>

168
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,950
<font color="yellow">"This should be taken care of
by us guys." That guy?</font>

169
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,750
<font color="yellow">Are there still people
like that, these days?</font>

170
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,950
<font color="yellow">Ew. Ew.</font>

171
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,550
<font color="yellow">Well, whether it be this guy
or that guy, keep one thing in mind.</font>

172
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

173
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,950
<font color="yellow">Make sure to use a condom
when you have sex.</font>

174
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,840
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

175
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,550
<font color="yellow">You're embarrassing me!</font>

176
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,950
<font color="yellow">Oh ho.</font>

177
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,250
<font color="yellow">I should go wash up.</font>

178
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,840
<font color="yellow">The order is ready for table four.</font>

179
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,750
<font color="yellow">Here's one carbonara,
and one gamberoni.</font>

180
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, Ms. Jin Myung.
You're not doing anything after, right?</font>

181
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,640
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jae Hwan got an award
so we're having a staff dinner.</font>

182
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,750
<font color="yellow">Oh, sir! You're here?</font>

183
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,140
<font color="yellow">The kitchen staff have a lot to do!
Come on, let's hurry!</font>

184
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,050
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Hyun Hui! Ms. Hyun Hui!
- Yes?</font>

185
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,250
<font color="yellow">Where's Ms. Jin Myung?</font>

186
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,450
<font color="yellow">She left already because
she has another part-time job.</font>

187
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,950
<font color="yellow">- Here, eat.
- No, I don't want to.</font>

188
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,950
<font color="yellow">Say "ah!"</font>

189
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,140
<font color="yellow">You're so cute.</font>

190
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,250
<font color="yellow">It was hard for you today
because of Chief Park, right?</font>

191
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,640
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I was so pissed!</font>

192
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,450
<font color="yellow">Welcome!</font>

193
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,550
<font color="yellow">Damn, why are there so many
convenience stores in this neighborhood?</font>

194
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,450
<font color="yellow">This is the fifth one
I went to, already!</font>

195
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

196
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,550
<font color="yellow">Here, give that to me.</font>

197
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,550
<font color="yellow">- No.
- No, it's fine. Give it to me.</font>

198
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,750
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

199
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,750
<font color="yellow">- I can just throw it out here, right?
- Yes.</font>

200
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,750
<font color="yellow">Did you come to look for me?</font>

201
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,140
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

202
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,950
<font color="yellow">Oh, um...
just a second.</font>

203
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,050
<font color="yellow">It's a bit weird to drink
coffee at night, so...</font>

204
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,140
<font color="yellow">- That'll be 2,300 won.
- Okay.</font>

205
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,050
<font color="yellow">Which one would you like to drink?</font>

Yeah! That's all I want from them.</font>

you go to a better college than me!</font>

<font color="yellow">No, that's just because they
asked me to fill in an occupation.</font>

259
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,750
<font color="yellow">You could've just written
"college student," then!</font>

Get out.</font>

have to do with you?</font>

are you dating a thug like him?</font>

271
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,050
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone!</font>

272
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, you crazy bitch.
Are you an idiot?</font>

273
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,550
<font color="yellow">Why are you seeing him?
That kind of bastard is--</font>

274
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,340
<font color="yellow">Shut up! I don't want to hear it!
I'll take care of my own damn love life!</font>

275
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,640
<font color="yellow">You ---- idiot! You still
want to date him even after--</font>

276

<font color="yellow">What about you, then? It's not
like your love life is much better!</font>

277
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,550
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

278
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,140
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you think you and
I are alike, you idiot?</font>

279
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,450
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here and start
bitching at me? This is our house!</font>

280
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,950
<font color="yellow">Go back to your own place!</font>

281
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,140
<font color="yellow">I'm going!</font>

282
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,550
<font color="yellow">Don't ever come back!</font>

283
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,840
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't come even
if you begged me, bitch!</font>

284

00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,140
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
- Oh, hey!</font>

293
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,250
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the meal!</font>

294
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,140
<font color="yellow">- You're done already?
- Yes.</font>

295
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,050
<font color="yellow">- There's still food there, though.
- No, I'm done.</font>

296
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,740
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jae Hwan!</font>

297
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,350
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

298
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,140
<font color="yellow">Here's a congratulatory gift for you.</font>

299
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,950
<font color="yellow">You didn't need to get
anything like this for me!</font>

300
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,850
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

301
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,240
<font color="yellow">It really is nothing.</font>

302
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,140
<font color="yellow">All right. Here's one
M-steak, and one ribeye.</font>

303
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

304
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,140
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you going to sharpen
your knife all day?</font>

305
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,740
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to work?</font>

306
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,850
<font color="yellow">I apologize.
I apologize.</font>

307
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,140
<font color="yellow">Please, enjoy your meal.</font>

308
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,140
<font color="yellow">- Hey, check on that.
- Yes, sir.</font>

309
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,950
<font color="yellow">Yoon Jin Myung.</font>

310
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,350
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

311
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:19,050
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'd want to eat food
that was served by a hand like this?</font>

312
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,740
<font color="yellow">What if a customer complained about it?</font>

313
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,740
<font color="yellow">Everyone else can leave.</font>

314
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,550
<font color="yellow">I put myself through college too.</font>

315
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,740
<font color="yellow">I did it by tutoring my cousin.</font>

316
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,550
<font color="yellow">I took care of my room and board like
that, but I was worried about tuition</font>

317
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,950
<font color="yellow">and my transportation fees.
I was always worrying about money.</font>

318
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,050
<font color="yellow">Before, well... there were other
people watching, so...</font>

319
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,350
<font color="yellow">I know how hard things
must be for you right now.</font>

320
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,740
<font color="yellow">Here, eat up.</font>

321
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

322
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,740
<font color="yellow">I'll help you with the check, ma'am.</font>

323
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,550
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

324
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,950
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

325
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,240
<font color="yellow">I'll ring you up.</font>

326
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,350
<font color="yellow">That'll be 125,800 won.</font>

327
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,550
<font color="yellow">I mean, isn't it weird?</font>

328
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:45,950
<font color="yellow">He was screaming at her yesterday as
if he was going to fire her right there</font>

329
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,050
<font color="yellow">and said, "wouldn't you lose
your appetite, as the customer?"</font>

330
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,550
<font color="yellow">So, how did she get to work
at the counter overnight?</font>

331
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,140
<font color="yellow">She gets paid 7,500 won per hour for
standing around and pressing buttons?</font>

332
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,850
<font color="yellow">How is that any of your business?
Why are you so mad about it?</font>

333
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,140
<font color="yellow">It's making it hard on me because
the new person keeps messing up!</font>

334
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,550
<font color="yellow">You have such a nasty temper.</font>

335
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,850
<font color="yellow">Something definitely happened
between the two of them.</font>

336
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,740
<font color="yellow">Hurry the hell up!</font>

337
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm coming now!</font>

338
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:23,240
<font color="yellow">It was so risky last night.
I almost called my lover!</font>

339
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,050
<font color="yellow">And tell him things like,
"come over. I'm lonely."</font>

340
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,640
<font color="yellow">You can't call him?</font>

341
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,950
<font color="yellow">Idiot. Of course not.</font>

342
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,850
<font color="yellow">You know, the relationship
between men and women...</font>

343
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,050
<font color="yellow">is like a see-saw.</font>

344
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:44,740
<font color="yellow">If I go up, the other person goes down.</font>

345
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,950
<font color="yellow">If one person gets clingy,
the other person runs away.</font>

346
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,240
<font color="yellow">Anyway, that's not the important thing.</font>

347
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,350
<font color="yellow">What... should I do?</font>

348
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,740
<font color="yellow">About your bad dreams, you mean?</font>

349
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,740
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying!</font>

350
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,550
<font color="yellow">I keep having this nightmare
ever since I moved.</font>

351
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,450
<font color="yellow">So, what happens in the dream?</font>

352
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,240
<font color="yellow">You know, that is...</font>

353
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,350
<font color="yellow">I've fallen into water.</font>

354
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,140
<font color="yellow">The water is pitch black...</font>

355
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,550
<font color="yellow">but something is staring
at me inside the water.</font>

356
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,850
<font color="yellow">It seems like a person's eyes...</font>

357
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,240
<font color="yellow">but it also seems like it could
be the eyes of some beast.</font>

358
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,850
<font color="yellow">Those eyes get farther, and farther...</font>

359
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,740
<font color="yellow">but they keep staring at me.</font>

360
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,350
<font color="yellow">But I...</font>

361
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,850
<font color="yellow">Want to come to my place, Mister?</font>

362
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,450
<font color="yellow">No, that won't work.</font>

363
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,950
<font color="yellow">It's my lover's place</font>

364
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,240
<font color="yellow">so it's not good manners for me
to bring another man there.</font>

365
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,740
<font color="yellow">Even I have enough manners
not to do something like that.</font>

366
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,050
<font color="yellow">Just a second.
I need to use the bathroom.</font>

367
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,450
<font color="yellow">I waited for you at the
back door yesterday, too.</font>

368
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,450
<font color="yellow">The manager drove me home.</font>

369
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,140
<font color="yellow">Do you know that people
are talking about you?</font>

370
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,350
<font color="yellow">Tell me that it's not like that.</font>

371
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,450
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

372
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,850
<font color="yellow">Would you trust me if I told you?</font>

373
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,740
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

374
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,050
<font color="yellow">- I'm in here!
- Hey, I'm about to pee.</font>

375
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:25,350
<font color="yellow">Get out. It's coming out!
It's coming out! Hurry up!</font>

376
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, hurry up!
It's coming out!</font>

377
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,240
<font color="yellow">It came out!</font>

378
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,740
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

379
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,140
<font color="yellow">What the hell?</font>

380
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,850
<font color="yellow">It looks like she's really drunk.</font>

381
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,240
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that's whatever.
But why is she here?</font>

382
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,050
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's like what
General Kim Yusin said?</font>

383
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,350
<font color="yellow">People usually go back to
where they're used to going.</font>

384
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,350
<font color="yellow">Senior Kang is here.</font>

385
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,140
<font color="yellow">I know. I saw her on the way up.</font>

386
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,550
<font color="yellow">My bad.</font>

387
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,850
<font color="yellow">Thanks for letting me use
your bathroom. I'll be going now.</font>

388
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,140
<font color="yellow">- Song.
- Yes, ma'am?</font>

389
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,550
<font color="yellow">The ghost over there is gone now, right?</font>

390
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,740
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

391
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,850
<font color="yellow">You don't see it anymore
nowadays, right?</font>

392
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,350
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you don't.</font>

393
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,350
<font color="yellow">It followed me to this house, after all.</font>

394
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,240
<font color="yellow">That ghost is way too busy nowadays
appearing in my dreams.</font>

395
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,740
<font color="yellow">- Oh no.
- Hey, hey!</font>

396
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,550
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

397
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,240
<font color="yellow">Don't see that guy anymore.</font>

398
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,050
<font color="yellow">I just don't want you to get hurt.</font>

399
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,850
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about you.</font>

400
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,240
<font color="yellow">- Ugh.
- Ow!</font>

401
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,240
<font color="yellow">You're seriously such an idiot.</font>

402
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,050
<font color="yellow">This girl doesn't realize
what a catch she really is.</font>

403
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,450
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even know that, and
is dating some thug-ass punk.</font>

404
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,050
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

405
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,450
<font color="yellow">Geez. What's with her, blabbing
drunkenly at someone else's place?</font>

406
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you know that people
are talking about you?</i></font>

407
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,140
<font color="yellow">Tell me that it's not like that!</font>

408
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,240
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't.</i></font>

409
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,450
<font color="yellow">Work at the counter until
your fingernail is fully healed.</font>

410
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,350
<font color="yellow">And if you have anything that ever
troubles you, think of me as an uncle...</font>

411
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,550
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't tell him that nothing happened.</i></font>

412
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:45,740
<font color="yellow"><i>He knew the meaning behind that action.</i></font>

413
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,550
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

414
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,050
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

415
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,450
<font color="yellow"><i>And I knew the meaning
behind that action, too.</i></font>

416
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,550
<font color="yellow"><i>I hated you all this time.</i></font>

417
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,050
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought that I was
a better person than you were.</i></font>

418
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,740
<font color="yellow"><i>But in reality, I wasn't.</i></font>

419
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,140
<font color="yellow"><i>It's just that...</i></font>

420
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,450
<font color="yellow"><i>I never had to face as much
temptation as you did.</i></font>

421
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's Sunday.</font>

422
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, everyone, for the
trouble I caused yesterday.</font>

423
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:37,740
<font color="yellow">That ghost...
has been here this whole time.</font>

424
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,740
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

425
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,240
<font color="yellow">You said yesterday that you thought
that ghost followed you here.</font>

426
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,350
<font color="yellow">I said that?</font>

427
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,950
<font color="yellow">You don't remember?</font>

428
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:53,350
<font color="yellow">At any rate, it's been here this
whole time. It didn't follow you.</font>

429
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,050
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

430
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,350
<font color="yellow">Then... what was that?</font>

431
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,140
<font color="yellow">Can't I just live here?</font>

432
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,240
<font color="yellow">I know that it's stupid of me to
move out, and then move back in</font>

433
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,050
<font color="yellow">and I know that I lied to you all.</font>

434
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,950
<font color="yellow">I know that, but...</font>

435
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,140
<font color="yellow">But, still.
Can't I live here?</font>

436
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,350
<font color="yellow">- Here, have some.
- Thank you.</font>

437
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,050
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit nervous.</font>

438
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,050
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

439
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,350
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.

442
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,240
<font color="yellow">Just her vibe, in general.</font>

443
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,550
<font color="yellow">I didn't really like her much, either.</font>

445
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,240
<font color="yellow">Me too.
I didn't exactly love her, but...</font>

446
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,050
<font color="yellow">Right? I didn't like her much, either.</font>

447
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,740
<font color="yellow">She's too plain.</font>

448
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,850
<font color="yellow">Exactly! She's way too plain.
She's no fun.</font>

449
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,550
<font color="yellow">People should have the vibe of just
coming and going as they please</font>

450
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,140
<font color="yellow">and seem like they may lie a bit.</font>

Oh no!</font>

455
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,850
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

456
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,850
<font color="yellow">He can't live, or die...</font>

My child! Joon Myung!</font>

459

<font color="yellow">It's all due to your wretched mother
that you ended up like this!</font>

460

<font color="yellow">It's all my fault!
Oh, my son!</font>

461

<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
His condition has stabilized.</font>

463
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,850

- All right, bye!</font>

466
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,350
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to you?</font>

467
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,240
<font color="yellow">My younger brother didn't die.</font>

468
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:21,050
<font color="yellow">He hasn't died for two whole years now.</font>

469
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,950
<font color="yellow">I thought he'd really die this time.</font>

470
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,450
<font color="yellow">I was really hoping that he'd just die.</font>

471
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,050

472
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,140
<font color="yellow">Do you still like me?</font>

473
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,550
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

474
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:09,240
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

475
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:19,350
<font color="yellow">When I think that someone
may like me, I become weak.</font>

476
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,740
<font color="yellow">And if I become weak now...</font>

477
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:29,740
