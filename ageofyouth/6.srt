I'm the only one who's by myself here!</font>

90
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,800

92
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,800
<font color="yellow">Mister, What kind of relationship
do you have with Senior Kang?</font>

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,899
<font color="yellow">We just see each other
every now and then,</font>

94
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,199
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on!</font>

95
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,300
<font color="yellow">It's true,</font>

96
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
<font color="yellow">So why did you come
here today, then?</font>

97
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
<font color="yellow">Well, she made an emergency
request to me, so,,,</font>

98
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,300
<font color="yellow">and I had nothing else to do,</font>

99
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,199
<font color="yellow">You like Senior Kang, right?</font>

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,800
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to answer,
down another beer in one shot!</font>

101
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
<font color="yellow">One shot!</font>

102
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,300
<font color="yellow">- Whoa,
- Whoa,</font>

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
<font color="yellow">- What about you, Mister?
- Why are you calling me that?</font>

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,600
<font color="yellow">It's my decision, Why? Because
I'm the only one who's by myself here!</font>

105
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,399
<font color="yellow">You two fought, right?
How did you make amends?</font>

106
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
<font color="yellow">Do you want to break up with me?</font>

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
<font color="yellow">So why did you say
something like that, then?</font>

108
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,200
<font color="yellow">Because you,,,</font>

109
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
It's all my fault,</font>

110
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,899
<font color="yellow">I got on my knees and
begged for forgiveness,</font>

111
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,700
<font color="yellow">So why did you do something that you'd
have to apologize like that for?</font>

112
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,500
<font color="yellow">- Hey, don't ask stuff like that!
- Shush!</font>

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,399
<font color="yellow">I know, right?
I'm kind of an idiot,</font>

114
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,200
<font color="yellow">Are you going to do
anything idiotic again?</font>

115
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,399
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you drinking?
Don't drink!</font>

116
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,500
<font color="yellow">Hey!
You can't!</font>

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,500
<font color="yellow">I know that our baby Eun Soon
has a crush on another guy,</font>

118
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,200
<font color="yellow">So how did you get invited here?</font>

119
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
<font color="yellow">Um, Yoon-Jae-said-that-she,,,</font>

122
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,600
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

123
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,899
<font color="yellow">Well,,,</font>

124
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,299

- NC-17!</font>

<font color="yellow">All right, truth bomb time!</font>

128
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,600
<font color="yellow">Why is it that Song Ji Won
is so unpopular among guys?</font>

129
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,700
<font color="yellow">It's quite mysterious, isn't it?</font>

130
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,700
<font color="yellow">I mean, just look at my face,
And my body,</font>

131
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,799
<font color="yellow">I even have a great personality,
to boot, So why?</font>

132
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,399
<font color="yellow">Do you hate perfect women?</font>

133
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,600
<font color="yellow">Well, no, Rather than that,,,</font>

134
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
<font color="yellow">I hate -blank- type of woman!
Fill in the blank!</font>

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,100
<font color="yellow">Women who talk a lot,</font>

136
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
<font color="yellow">Girls who are nosy!</font>

137
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,000
<font color="yellow">Girls with no tact are a bit,,,</font>

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,100
<font color="yellow">So,,, a woman who talks a lot,
is nosy, and has no tact! That is,,,</font>

139
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
<font color="yellow">- You!
- You!</font>

140
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,200
<font color="yellow">- Look, this is as big as your tooth!
- Wow!</font>

141
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,500
<font color="yellow">- How'd you find that?
- Here, compare it! Look!</font>

142
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you comparing people's
teeth to that? It makes me feel bad!</font>

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,500
<font color="yellow">It really does look alike, though,</font>

145
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,000
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- What, is there someone in there?</font>

146

- Yes,</font>

208
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,799

<font color="yellow">Why is it acting like that?</font>

263
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

264
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,500
<font color="yellow">It's totally red,</font>

making my head hurt,</font>

271

you don't want to clean, right?</font>

272

<font color="yellow">- Get the alcohol down! Down! Down! Down!
- Get the alcohol down! Down! Down! Down!</font>

295
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:04,200
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're awesome!</font>

296
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,599
<font color="yellow">The celebration was over,</font>

297
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,700
<font color="yellow">The anticipation and excitement
surrounding this event were all but gone</font>

298
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,500
<font color="yellow">and everyone returned to their safe
and boring everyday lives,</font>

299
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,299
<font color="yellow">Eun Jae,</font>

300
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,799
<font color="yellow">Your older brother has an allergy?</font>

301
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,599
<font color="yellow">Yes,</font>

302
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,900
<font color="yellow">But you said that you didn't
have an older brother,</font>

303
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,400
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

304
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,200
<font color="yellow">- Do you have an older brother?
- No,</font>

305
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:29,200
<font color="yellow">- I had an older brother,
- So what happened?</font>

306
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,900
<font color="yellow">He died because of his peanut allergy,</font>

307
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,700
<font color="yellow">Wow, allergies are so scary,</font>

308
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,000
<font color="yellow">However, their everyday lives
that started again after that night</font>

309
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
<font color="yellow">were not the same
as they'd been before,</font>

310
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,599
<font color="yellow">The slight anomaly in our lives
came to affect our daily lives,</font>

311
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,299
<font color="yellow">This irregularity caused
a fracture in our routines,</font>

312
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,799
<font color="yellow">No matter how much we'd sweep and clean,
our daily lives would never be the same,</font>

313
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,299
<font color="yellow">The impact that this
celebration had upon us--</font>

314
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:06,000
<font color="yellow">That's enough of your damn soliloquy!
Start cleaning with us, already!</font>

315
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,799
<font color="yellow">You're the one who made
the biggest mess!</font>

316
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,299
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm going to die,
If I get up now, I'll vomit,</font>

317
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,700
<font color="yellow">I'll definitely vomit,</font>

318
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,299
<font color="yellow">So who told you to
drink so damn much?</font>

319
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,200
<font color="yellow">Youth,</font>

320
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,500
<font color="yellow">Even though I don't know
what tomorrow brings</font>

321
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,599
<font color="yellow">I'll drink like there's no tomorrow,</font>

322
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,200
<font color="yellow">About that guy from yesterday,,,
what does he do for a living?</font>

323
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,400
<font color="yellow">- I'm not so sure myself,
- Huh?</font>

324
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,900
<font color="yellow">You brought a virtual
stranger here, then?</font>

325
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,599
<font color="yellow">And through the fracture
that this celebration created</font>

326
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,500
<font color="yellow">we soon became privy to the deepest
and darkest parts of each other,</font>

327
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,700
<font color="yellow">Is the creature living on the dark
side of the moon a rabbit?</font>

328
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,599
<font color="yellow">Or, is it a monster?</font>

329
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,599
<font color="yellow">I'll stop!</font>

330
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,200
<font color="yellow">Geez,</font>

331
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,400
<font color="yellow">Wow, we sure drank a lot,</font>

332
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,299
<font color="yellow">- Senior,
- Yes, my child?</font>

333
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:23,599
<font color="yellow">Guys joke about things like
that all the time, right?</font>

334
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,799
<font color="yellow">They say that they like people
during drinking games and stuff</font>

335
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,500
<font color="yellow">and say things like, "let's go out,"</font>

336
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,200
<font color="yellow">Yeah, there are some guys like that,</font>

337
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,799
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

338
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that's what it was,</font>

339
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,400
<font color="yellow">Our daily lives, which the
celebration affected,</font>

340
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,599
<font color="yellow">Secrets that we'd hid under the surface
came to see the light of day, and--</font>

341
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,000
<font color="yellow">Ugh! Ugh, I feel like I'm going to die!</font>

342
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,700
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, If I ever touch
alcohol again, I'm Dog Ji Won!</font>

343
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,099
<font color="yellow">Ugh, my head,</font>

344
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:57,200
<font color="yellow">I'll leave the rest to you, child,</font>

345
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,700
<font color="yellow">- Want these?
- Hmm,</font>

346
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,200
<font color="yellow">Wow, there's so many different kinds!</font>

347
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, this looks good!</font>

348
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,299
<font color="yellow">Wow, look at these colors!
They're so pretty!</font>

349
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,298
<font color="yellow">[Senior Kang/Kang Yi Na]</font>

350
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,798
<font color="yellow">Oh! I was going to do the dishes,</font>

351
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's okay, I'll do it,
You can just get some rest,</font>

352
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:54,798
<font color="yellow">- Honey,
- Huh?</font>

353
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:56,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so good to me?</font>

354
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,298
<font color="yellow">Because I don't know when
I'll be cruel to you again,</font>

355
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,400
<font color="yellow">Please, enjoy,</font>

356
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,700
<font color="yellow">It's best to spend money
that you got easily, with carelessness,</font>

357
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,400
<font color="yellow">What good would it do you
to be stingy with that money?</font>

358
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,598
<font color="yellow">Geez,</font>

359
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,200
<font color="yellow">I'm right though, aren't I?</font>

360
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,598
<font color="yellow">You remind me of my bathroom mirror,</font>

361
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:25,500
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

362
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,900
<font color="yellow">You're too honest, which pisses me off,</font>

363
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,798
<font color="yellow">Friends shouldn't Photoshop the
reality of their lives to one another,</font>

364
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,500
<font color="yellow">So? Who did you bring
to the party instead of me?</font>

365
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,900
<font color="yellow">Um,,,</font>

366
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:53,598
<font color="yellow">Do guys cry too?</font>

367
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:55,500
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

368
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,298
<font color="yellow">When was the last time you cried?</font>

369
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,098
<font color="yellow">Last week,</font>

370
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,598
<font color="yellow">Why, so you could get money
from your sugar mama?</font>

371
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,098
<font color="yellow">Yep,</font>

372
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,700
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't cried since I was 15,</font>

373
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,400
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

374
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,298
<font color="yellow">That has nothing to do with me,</font>

375
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,298
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on, now,
Family is family,</font>

376
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:49,400
<font color="yellow">You know that old tune?
"Forget about all of your woes,"</font>

377
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,200
<font color="yellow">"My mother, who works
tirelessly night and day,,,"</font>

378
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,298
<font color="yellow">Oh, and, "my mother's debt is my debt!"</font>

379
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:59,798
<font color="yellow">Trying to make people pay for
other people's debts is against the law,</font>

380
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:01,500
<font color="yellow">You little--</font>

381
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,298
<font color="yellow">You're not going to get ready?</font>

382
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,199
<font color="yellow">- That little--
- Hey, hey,</font>

383
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,300
<font color="yellow">Keep still, punk,
You can't even fight,</font>

384
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,699
<font color="yellow">I'll help you process your payment,</font>

385
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,099
<font color="yellow">That'll be 118,500 won,
Did you enjoy your meal?</font>

386
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,599
<font color="yellow">Yes,</font>

387
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
<font color="yellow">Thank you,</font>

388
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,400
<font color="yellow">- Let's go,
- I'm so worn out,</font>

389
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,300
<font color="yellow">Joo Hyun Hee already left,</font>

390
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not waiting for Ms, Hyun Hee,</font>

391
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,699
<font color="yellow">About those people from earlier,,,</font>

392
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,800
<font color="yellow">will you be all right?</font>

393
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,599
<font color="yellow">Yes,</font>

394
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,199
<font color="yellow">I'll take you home,</font>

395
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,599
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

396
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,300
<font color="yellow">Do I really need a reason--</font>

397
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,699
<font color="yellow">Do I,,,</font>

398
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:19,500
<font color="yellow">really need a reason to do that for you?</font>

399
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
<font color="yellow">I told you not to be nice to me,</font>

400
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,300
<font color="yellow">Do you think that it was easy
for me to say that to you?</font>

401
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
<font color="yellow">What, do you think
this is easy for me, then?</font>

402
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,500
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm totally
fine with being rejected?</font>

403
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,699
<font color="yellow">Every time you push me away like this,
I hate it, and I feel so humiliated!</font>

404
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,199
<font color="yellow">So that's why,,,</font>

405
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,800
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't,</font>

406
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,699
<font color="yellow">I like her,</font>

407
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,699
<font color="yellow">I like Yoon Jae,</font>

408
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,800
<font color="yellow">No way,</font>

409
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,699
<font color="yellow">I like Yoon Jae!</font>

410
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,199
<font color="yellow">I like you,</font>

411
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're wearing a skirt!</font>

412
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was organizing my
clothes, and saw it, so,,,</font>

413
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,900
<font color="yellow">and I thought it'd be a waste
to throw it away, so I put it on,</font>

414
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,199
<font color="yellow">It looks weird, right?</font>

415
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,000
<font color="yellow">- I'll go change,
- No, no!</font>

416
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
<font color="yellow">Come over here!</font>

417
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,800
<font color="yellow">You look pretty!
Look, It's cute, right?</font>

418
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,699
<font color="yellow">I bet Jong Yeol will be so happy
that he'll piss himself,</font>

419
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:32,599
<font color="yellow">You and your nasty mouth!
Why, I ought to,,,</font>

420
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:36,800
<font color="yellow">Oh ho,</font>

421
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,699
<font color="yellow">Come with me for a second,</font>

422
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,699
<font color="yellow">Look, You look different just
by trimming your eyebrows!</font>

423
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,300
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any other bags?</font>

424
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,000
<font color="yellow">No,</font>

425
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,300
<font color="yellow">- Oh,,, oh well, then,
- I'll be going, then!</font>

426
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,500
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

427
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:35,599
<font color="yellow">You think that a bag
is just a bag, right?</font>

428
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,900
<font color="yellow">Make sure you take
good care of my baby,</font>

429
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,400
<font color="yellow">Be super careful,
And be gentle with it!</font>

430
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,400
<font color="yellow">- Hello!
- Hello!</font>

431
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,699
<font color="yellow">- Have you all been well?
- Yes!</font>

432
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,900
<font color="yellow">All right, we'll be talking about
evolutionary psychology,</font>

433
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,500
<font color="yellow">And we'll be focusing on the
psychology of relationships!</font>

434
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,699
<font color="yellow">All right, Why do men
like glamorous women?</font>

435
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:16,300
<font color="yellow">Why do girls like rich guys? Why are male
animals usually more fancy-looking?</font>

436
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,800
<font color="yellow">We'll be delving into our topic
by using these questions,</font>

437
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,300
<font color="yellow">Well, men wish to pass down their DNA by
dating as many women as possible,</font>

438
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,699
<font color="yellow">And women want a reliable man
who will provide for her and the family,</font>

439
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,500
<font color="yellow">I've made a list of relevant readings and
sent them out as an announcement</font>

440

thought of such an ending?</font>

560

<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

561
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,199

that he shouldn't?</font>

567
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:46,800
<font color="yellow">But, what if he gets
angry if I say no?</font>
