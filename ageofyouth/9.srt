could've been an accident.</font>

144

you'd be betraying your dad</font>

in your name, too.</font>

151
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,580
<font color="yellow">They had to talk to them because of the
accident that my stepfather was in.</font>

152
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,480

in touch with them, so...</font>

153
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,200

How about Sunday at 5:00 p.m.?</font>

178
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,700
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you then!</font>

179
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,590

180
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,900
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's so slippery!</font>

181
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,490
<font color="yellow">- I'd let it air out.
- Why?</font>

182
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,390
<font color="yellow">Ew! Hey!</font>

183
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,700

186
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,900
<font color="yellow">Yep. It's as if she's desperate to
not be alone for even a second.</font>

months now, my weekends have been busy.</font>

I need to rest a bit to recharge!</font>

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,690

204
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,300
<font color="yellow">By clothes, do you mean
like the things you wear?</font>

205
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,790
<font color="yellow">They want me to come and interview.</font>

206
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,390
<font color="yellow">- That place from before?
- Yeah.</font>

207
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,890

pass the interview!</font>

211
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,080

when we can!</font>

212

215
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's great.</font>

216
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,790
<font color="yellow">Sit, sit, sit.</font>

217
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,890
<font color="yellow">- Really, congrats!
- This is great.</font>

218
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,980
<font color="yellow">- Yi Na, let's eat together.
- Nah. I already ate.</font>

219
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,390
<font color="yellow">All right, then. Let's drink to
Senior Yoon passing her interview!</font>

220
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,900
<font color="yellow">Congrats!</font>

221
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,190
<font color="yellow">That's a public enterprise, right? If
you get the job, you'll be set for life.</font>

222
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,890
<font color="yellow">Wow, that must be great!
How much will your annual salary be?</font>

223
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,390
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'm not hired yet.</font>

224
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,890
<font color="yellow">I bet she'll get at least
35 million won per year!</font>

225
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,690
<font color="yellow">Wow! 35 million won per year?</font>

226
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,280
<font color="yellow">You can't just ignore us
after you make it big, okay?</font>

227
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,480
<font color="yellow">You have to buy us food every time
you get a promotion, okay?</font>

228
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,780
<font color="yellow">I mean, if you passed all the preliminary
stuff, you're pretty much hired.</font>

229
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,890
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah! Let's have a ten-year
reunion among ourselves.</font>

230
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,090
<font color="yellow">It'll be fun, right?</font>

231
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,390
<font color="yellow">In ten years, I'll be 32.
I don't know about that.</font>

232
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,090
<font color="yellow">By then, I'll be a journalist-turned-
novelist, so I'll be super busy</font>

233
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,090
<font color="yellow">making media appearances, and
dealing with publishing companies.</font>

234
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,190
<font color="yellow">So I don't know if I'll have time then.</font>

235
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,780
<font color="yellow">We can just meet up with you
at the broadcasting station, then.</font>

236
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,090
<font color="yellow">I'll be food columnist, Jung Ye Eun!</font>

237
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,890
<font color="yellow">I hope that cooking shows
will be popular until then!</font>

238
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,090
<font color="yellow">What will you be doing?</font>

239
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
<font color="yellow">Um... a psychological counselor?</font>

240
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,090
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be funny to have
a socially awkward counselor?</font>

241
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,400
<font color="yellow">"Um... so... what... brings you here?"</font>

242
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,780
<font color="yellow">But still, you must be happy.
You'll only be 30 in 10 years.</font>

243
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,290
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

244
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,780
<font color="yellow">And as for Senior Kang...</font>

245
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,090
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to know
what'll happen in ten years</font>

246
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
<font color="yellow">when I don't even know
what'll happen tomorrow?</font>

247
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,100
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Cheers!</font>

- Ow!</font>

250
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,990
<font color="yellow">Hurry up! Let's go!</font>

251
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,190
<font color="yellow">- What about Senior Kang?
- She said she has plans.</font>

252
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,280
<font color="yellow">Aw. I feel like Senior Kang would
be best at picking out clothes.</font>

253
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.
FaPe is here!</font>

255
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,290
<font color="yellow">I know, but... is that "fashion

256
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,100
<font color="yellow">Senior Yoon, you jokester!</font>

257
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,690
<font color="yellow">All right, let's go!</font>

258
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,290
<font color="yellow">- Shopping for clothes!
- Whoo!</font>

259
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,990
<font color="yellow">Madame Jung.</font>

260
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,100
<font color="yellow">The clothes here are expensive.</font>

261
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,600
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

262
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,790
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:28,810
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd

264
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,200
<font color="yellow">Sheesh!</font>

265
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,190
<font color="yellow">- Senior!
- Huh?</font>

266
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,590
<font color="yellow">Try this!
This!</font>

267
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,190
<font color="yellow">Isn't it pretty?</font>

268
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,900
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

269
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,790
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

270
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,690
<font color="yellow">This, this, this.</font>

271
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,900
<font color="yellow">I can try them on, right?</font>

272
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,480
<font color="yellow">It's pretty, though.</font>

273
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,200
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

274
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,490
<font color="yellow">Try this.</font>

275
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,290
<font color="yellow">- How is it?
- It looks like a school uniform.</font>

276
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
<font color="yellow">Whoo!</font>

277
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,900
<font color="yellow">The arms are a bit weird.</font>

278
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,790
<font color="yellow">It's totally pretty, though.
Buy this, okay?</font>

279
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,480
<font color="yellow">I really hope that Senior Yoon
gets the job.</font>

280
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,780
<font color="yellow">She will.</font>

281
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,390
<font color="yellow">Right? I think she'll
really get it this time.</font>

282
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,780
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

283
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,480
<font color="yellow">It's because of the timing. They say
that life is full of ups and downs</font>

284
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,780
<font color="yellow">Her life has been full of downs now, so
it's about time things looked up for her.</font>

285
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,480
<font color="yellow">I don't know about ups
and downs, or whatever</font>

286
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,390
<font color="yellow">but if I were the boss, I'd pick
someone who'd work well.</font>

287
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,390
<font color="yellow">And there's nobody who looks like
they'd do a better job than Senior Yoon.</font>

288
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,890
<font color="yellow">- No, there isn't.
- Nope, there isn't.</font>

289
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

290
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,890
<font color="yellow">She could've gotten eliminated
during the preliminaries</font>

291
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,280
<font color="yellow">because of her resume or age.</font>

292
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,400
<font color="yellow">But since she made it to the
interviews, she has this in the bag.</font>

293
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
<font color="yellow">Ooh!</font>

294
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
<font color="yellow">Does it look okay?</font>

295
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,600
<font color="yellow">Allow me to assist you
with your payment method.</font>

296
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,480
<font color="yellow">Here you are.</font>

297
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,780
<font color="yellow">Please give her a discount,
since she's paying all in cash!</font>

298
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,600
<font color="yellow">Can you give her an employee discount?</font>

299
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,400
<font color="yellow">Please! Thank you!</font>

300
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, middle-aged lady!
Over here, middle-aged lady!</font>

301
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,990
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, you wicked old lady!</font>

302
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,590
<font color="yellow">Stop laughing!</font>

303
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,700
<font color="yellow">Well, kids would consider you a
middle-aged lady. What's the big deal?</font>

304
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,480
<font color="yellow">Just wait until someone
calls you a middle-aged man.</font>

305
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,690
<font color="yellow">I've been hearing that since
I was in high school.</font>

306
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,980
<font color="yellow">And from a middle-aged woman, at that.</font>

307
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,890
<font color="yellow">- It pisses me off.
- Why are you still thinking about it?</font>

308
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,400
<font color="yellow">They were just kids.</font>

309
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,980
<font color="yellow">Because I'll really become a
middle-aged lady, sooner or later.</font>

310
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,480
<font color="yellow">And then, I'll become a grandma, too.</font>

311
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,090
<font color="yellow">What, were you planning to
never get old, or something?</font>

312
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,480
<font color="yellow">Did you want to become a
monster that never grows old?</font>

313
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,900
<font color="yellow">Why do you care?</font>

314
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

315
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,790
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.
So what happened with that guy?</font>

316
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,790
<font color="yellow">So, I...</font>

317
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,400
<font color="yellow">killed your daughter.</font>

318
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,790
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

319
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,290
<font color="yellow">Are you going to kill me, too?</font>

320
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,200
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

321
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,890
<font color="yellow">Please, leave.</font>

322
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,780
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

323
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,090
<font color="yellow">Get lost!</font>

324
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,900
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?
Get away from me, right now!</font>

325
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Everything worked out well.</i></font>

326
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,100
<font color="yellow">I won't have any reason
to see him anymore.</font>

327
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,890
<font color="yellow">What's with your face, then?</font>

328
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,980
<font color="yellow">What, what's wrong with my face?
Hey, let's go and eat.</font>

329
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,190
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have to go and work.</font>

330
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,100
<font color="yellow">Damn it. You should've
said so before, then!</font>

331
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,280
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

332
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,490
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

333
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,490
<font color="yellow">That was hard on you, huh?</font>

334
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,780
<font color="yellow">Oh, that was nice.</font>

335
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,480
<font color="yellow">What the heck is this?
I just turned on my phone!</font>

336
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,980
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Is something the matter?</font>

337
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,990
<font color="yellow">Huh? I think something
happened to Eun Jae!</font>

338
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,600
<font color="yellow">Um, excuse me.</font>

339
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,990
<font color="yellow">So? What did you tell him?</font>

340
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,600
<font color="yellow">So what did he say then?</font>

341
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,690
<font color="yellow">Why did you say that?</font>

342
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,900
<font color="yellow">What do you think they'd think if they
knew that dad knew, before he died?</font>

343
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,980
<font color="yellow">How is that a lie? Knowing how they look
doesn't make you acquaintances!</font>

344
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,090
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you to call me first!</font>

345
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,300
<font color="yellow">Why the hell did you go on a trip abroad
as soon as you got the insurance payout?</font>

346
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,390
<font color="yellow">All right. Sorry I got mad, but...</font>

347
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,280
<font color="yellow">You should take care of that yourself,
Mom! Do I need to tell you everything?</font>

348
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,400
<font color="yellow">So who told you to get
so many insurance plans?</font>

349
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,200
<font color="yellow">If you do that now,
they'll doubt you even more!</font>

350
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,490
<font color="yellow">Mom, I have to go to class now.</font>

351
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,990
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

352
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,890
<font color="yellow">Wow, seems quite serious.
Is something the matter?</font>

353
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,280
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

354
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,600
<font color="yellow">It's time for my lecture, so...</font>

355
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,780
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy.</font>

356
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,990
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait, wait! Not yet.
Let me take a photo first.</font>

357
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,980
<font color="yellow">Who are you even taking these photos for?</font>

358
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,980
<font color="yellow">These are all memories!
A page of my fleeting youth!</font>

359
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,190
<font color="yellow">Can't you change the
blurb on your profile?</font>

360
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,980
<font color="yellow">Why? What's wrong with it?</font>

361
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,280
<font color="yellow"><i>Just like a camel,
walking through the desert...</i></font>

362
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,190
<font color="yellow">I mean, what do you even mean by that?</font>

363
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,090
<font color="yellow">You know, diligently walking along my
own path without getting distracted.</font>

364
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,490
<font color="yellow">The fact that you even said that makes
me think that you're already distracted.</font>

365
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,890
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Gyeongnidan-gil tomorrow.</font>

366
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,090
<font color="yellow">I heard that they sell the second
most delicious mocha cake in Korea!</font>

367
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,490
<font color="yellow">You'll come, right?
Right? Right?</font>

368
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,900
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

369
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,490
<font color="yellow">Is she still in there?</font>

370
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,100
<font color="yellow">- Why? Who's in there?
- Senior Jung.</font>

371
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,400
<font color="yellow">Stop it already, and come out!</font>

372
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,890
<font color="yellow">Come on! Finish it up and come out,
already! I'm about to go in my pants!</font>

373
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,280
<font color="yellow">Did you clog the toilet?</font>

374
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,980
<font color="yellow">When did she go in there?</font>

375
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,400
<font color="yellow">Thirty minutes ago!</font>

376
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,890
<font color="yellow">I really have to go.</font>

377
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,100
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in there?</font>

378
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,400
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

379
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,290
<font color="yellow">Jung Ye Eun! Madame Jung!
Open the door!</font>

380
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,090
<font color="yellow">- She was in a good mood, though.
- Hey, here.</font>

381
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,090
<font color="yellow">That's why there's something
weird about this!</font>

382
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,140
<font color="yellow">Does it makes sense that she's in a
good mood, when she got her heart broken?</font>

383
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,990
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

384
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,290
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?
You endured so well up until now.</font>

385
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,190
<font color="yellow">- My armpit hair...
- Yeah, what about it?</font>

386
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,400
<font color="yellow">I have so much armpit hair!</font>

387
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,890
<font color="yellow">What about her armpit hair?</font>

388
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,200
<font color="yellow">It's one of the symptoms
of being single.</font>

school for quite a long time.</font>

407
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,380
<font color="yellow">Is there a reason for that?</font>

408
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,990
<font color="yellow">I took breaks due to having to work
to pay back my student loans.</font>

409
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,090
<font color="yellow">However, I do not believe that
I'm lacking in credentials.</font>

410
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,780
<font color="yellow">What I mean by credentials
is not licenses</font>

411
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,190
<font color="yellow">but having a great amount of
experience in the work force.</font>

412
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,190
<font color="yellow">I have a ton of working experience</font>

413
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
<font color="yellow">and I'm confident that I'd be
a good employee.</font>

414
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,090
<font color="yellow">Hey, what took you so long?
You're the one who wanted to meet up.</font>

415
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,200
<font color="yellow">You have to buy me something
delicious now, okay?</font>

416
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,790
<font color="yellow">This is my mom.</font>

417
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,890
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

418
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,600
<font color="yellow">I was so busy that I couldn't keep
an eye on my son, and now...</font>

419
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:35,590
<font color="yellow">I think you've misunderstood, ma'am.
I've no intention of marrying this man.</font>

420
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,090
<font color="yellow">So you don't need to worry.</font>

421
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,990
<font color="yellow">See, Mom? I told you that we don't
have that kind of relationship!</font>

422
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,500
<font color="yellow">We're just dating for fun.</font>

423
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,280
<font color="yellow">You should still set standards
for the types of fun you indulge in!</font>

424
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,780
<font color="yellow">You say that you have no intention
of marrying him, which is fine.</font>

425
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,880
<font color="yellow">It seems like you two have a
give-and-take thing going on</font>

426
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,890
<font color="yellow">so why aren't you adhering to the rules?</font>

427
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,880
<font color="yellow">You spent more than 2 million won
last week, in one day.</font>

428
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,890
<font color="yellow">Do you really think you're worthy
of spending that much of his money?</font>

429
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,500
<font color="yellow">So why did you spend...
so much this month?</font>

430
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,380
<font color="yellow">I'll return everything.</font>

431
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,390
<font color="yellow">That'd be nice.</font>

432
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,600
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

433
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,490
<font color="yellow">Wow, is today a special day?</font>

434
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,100
<font color="yellow">- I had an interview.
- Oh. Did it go well?</font>

435
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,190
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think so.</font>

436
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,500
<font color="yellow">Interview, my ass.</font>

437
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,100
<font color="yellow">- All right. Next.
- Yes.</font>

438
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,500
<font color="yellow">Allow me to get you another.</font>

439
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,000
