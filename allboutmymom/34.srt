<i> Episode 34</i>

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,680
Look here. Look here. Are you okay?

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,020
Hello. Please wake up.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,270
Oppa!

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,020
Chae Ri.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,580
Oppa, who is she?

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,930
I don't know. She collapsed while passing by.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,390
While passing by? It is strange.

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,170
Did you get back to your senses?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,940
I am sorry because I have anemia.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,930
Do you live in this neighborhood? Where do you live?

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,660
Excuse me. Get on me. I will take you home.

13
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,770
Chae Ri, you have baby lamb...

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,330
Huh?

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,990
I can go alone. Thank you.

16
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,960
Hmm are you really going to be okay?

17
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,400
What's wrong, Chae Ri?

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,350
I got dizzy suddenly.

19
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,880
Oh yeah?

20
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,800
Is it a pregnancy symptom?

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Huh? Is there something like that?

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah, I read it when I was studying.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,060
If you are carrying a baby, you can become anemic.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,170
This won't do. Get on my back.

25
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,120
Can I?

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,430
Of course. When you have a husband, why not use him?

27
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,870
Hey, how could you just jump on like that? <br>You might scare baby lamb.

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,850
This is great! Let's go! Move, move!

29
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,020
You like it that much?

30
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,750
But you got heavy, really.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,650
Is our baby lamb making you heavier?

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,980
- Oppa. <br> - Hm? What's wrong?

33
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,790
You have something you feel sorry toward me, right?

34
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,690
Huh? Why?

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,470
When you call me "Oppa", the intonation is different.

36
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,580
Just like now, if you call "Oppa", I feel like you feel sorry about something.

37
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,260
No.

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,370
<i>Such a quick sense.</i>

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,810
<i>What is there for you to be sorry toward me? I am always sorry toward you.</i>

40
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,770
By the way,

41
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,580
<i>my wallet.</i>

42
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,510
Huh? Why?

43
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,550
Oh, nothing.

44
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,600
<i> Where did that pick pocket go? </i>

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,960
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Mom Knows Best Team @ Viki </i>

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,350
<i>Go! Go!</i>

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,570
-Giddy up and go!<br>-Wow, you really are heavy.

48
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,220
Let's go. One...two...

49
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,810
Lee Hyeong Soon?

50
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,770
Lee Hyeong Soon.

51
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,920
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,320
Your mom went somewhere for a moment. Do you need something?

53
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,320
Because I am thirsty.

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,160
Oh okay. Wait a minute.

55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,040
I will do it for you. Here.

56
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,850
It is okay. Drink.

57
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,270
You said you have something to say to me?

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,940
Yes.

59
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,920
I gave much thought to it.

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
I won't go study in America.

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,240
<i>In the end...</i>

62
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,890
For saying I would go and canceling, I'm sorry.

63
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,160
Why not? Because of my Hoon Jae?

64
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,090
Yes.

65
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,180
Due to this incident, just with me being by Hoon Jae's side,

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,340
with the fact that Hoon Jae is breathing in this world,

67
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,120
I realized how grateful I am...

68
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,870
and how happy I am.

69
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,970
So I will no longer be greedy.

70
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,630
<i> You really love my Hoon Jae, huh? </i>

71
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,960
If you are against our marriage, we won't do it.

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,590
If you tell me not to see him, I will be patient.

73
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,540
If you tell me to go down to Seondam factory, I will.

74
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,130
Regardless of what it is,

75
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,760
it is better than Hoon Jae not being in this world.

76
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,620
You dreamed often that I came to save you?

77
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,520
I heard it from Assistant Manager Lee.

78
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,790
It happened when I was young.

79
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,750
Now I don't have that kind of dream anymore.

80
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,220
You still haven't left, huh?

81
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,180
Yeah. Now I am going to leave.

82
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,670
Jin Ae.

83
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,820
<i> My Hoon Jae's smile is beautiful like that, huh?</i>

84
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,240
<i> The smile that he never shows to me. </i>

85
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,120
<i> To the kids who love each other that much, doing like that...</i>

86
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,340
What? Someone robbed you?

87
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,340
Did you report it to the police?

88
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:11,990
Yes. I did, but it is the money that Chae Ri's grandma gave in order to buy Chae Ri something delicious.

89
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,920
How could you...you should have taken better care of it.

90
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,440
How could you not know someone stole from your left pocket?

91
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,210
That is what I want to say.

92
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,900
You, really. How are you going to take care of your household in the future when you are so reckless?

93
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,650
Don't say anything. If you were in my situation, you would have been victimized without even knowing.

94
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,490
Why would I be your situation? Am I such a irresponsible guy like you?

95
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,850
Am I the kind of person to jeopardize someone else?

96
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,800
What? Are you done talking?

97
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,460
Hyung, you still see me as an immature guy, right?

98
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,540
Then, an immature guy lives like this?

99
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,380
- Hyung, seriously. <br> - Hey.

100
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,640
Instead of this, you should go to sleep.<br> Aren't you going to work tomorrow?

101
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,920
You go and sleep.

102
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,100
Sleep.

103
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,520
Oppa must be upset.

104
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,260
Jang Chae Ri, you are immature. If you didn't say you wanted to eat the expensive food,

105
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,710
Oppa wouldn't have accepted the money from Grandma.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,670
Isn't Hyeong Soon Oppa's Hyung-nim too much?

107
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,790
<i>I hate you, Hyeong Soon Oppa's Hyungnim.</i>

108
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,120
I will go home and come back 2 hours later.

109
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,190
Please take care of Hoon Jae during that time.

110
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,770
Yes.

111
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,890
You didn't leave?

112
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,410
No. To take you home.

113
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,950
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Mom Knows Best Team @ Viki </i>

114
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,090
- CEO Jang. <br> - Mother.

115
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,550
Miss Hwang.

116
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,700
Hello.

117
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,150
Mother, what brought you here?

118
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,710
Because Chairman Seo's mother got admitted to the hospital.

119
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,450
Then why are you two together?

120
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,620
Yes, we came here to take care of something and we're leaving.

121
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,320
Excuse me. I will leave first.

122
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,020
Yeong Seon. CEO Hwang...

123
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,890
Mother, you came with Chauffeur Park, right?

124
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,790
Yes.

125
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,200
Then please go back safely. I have something to say to CEO Hwang.

126
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,920
CEO Jang.

127
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,920
How suspicious.

128
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,780
Over there. Over there. It's clothes I've seen often a long time ago.

129
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,460
Take your mother home.

130
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,270
I won't do that anymore.

131
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,180
Please go.

132
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,180
I will take you home.

133
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,120
Oh yeah? I guess my mother gave us some space so we can be together?

134
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,920
Was it the case? No way.

135
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,590
Here?

136
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,660
Okay. Just 5 minutes.

137
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,590
This is great. It feels like all the pain is gone.

138
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,160
So you really aren't going abroad to study?

139
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,190
Really.

140
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,940
If you kept saying you will go, I was going to follow you.

141
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,780
There is a reason for my injury.

142
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,860
My head.

143
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,010
How could you say that? You know how shocked I was because you got hurt?

144
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,270
For me, it was torture.

145
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,320
I am sorry. I said it wrong.

146
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,720
You are crying again.

147
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,700
I got it. Now I won't ever get hurt. I will always be careful.

148
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,650
This is all yours so I will make sure you don't have to worry.

149
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,450
Now you are thinking this, right?

150
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:22,280
"How could he be so good looking even with the bandages?"

151
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,960
You seem to be better if you're joking like this.

152
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,820
It seems so, right?

153
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,460
Jin Ae, I love you. I love you. I love you.

154
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,360
Saying "I love you" so easily like this is great.

155
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,530
<i> Thank you Hoon Jae for coming back so I can hug you like this. </i>

156
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,810
This tofu isn't meant to just be put in the stew and be finished.

157
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,570
You have to cut it like this so the water can come out.

158
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,830
Stop eating.

159
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
It is delicious even if you eat it like this.

160
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,550
You should eat like this then. Why make rice?

161
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,120
Why don't you live in a cave? Why?

162
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,550
Nobody should eat things raw all the time.

163
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,770
Then what will become of our side dish shop?

164
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,420
That's right. People need this so our shop will do well, right?

165
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,410
That's right.

166
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,480
So cut it.

167
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,430
Did you sleep well?

168
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,660
Jin Ae, how is Manager Kang?

169
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,280
He is a lot better now. He will get discharged soon.

170
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,630
Aigoo, that's a relief. I guessed he must have been scared out of his life.

171
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,340
Get discharged from the hospital? Is Oppa Hoon Jae sick somewhere?

172
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,930
Yes. I didn't tell you because I thought you will get shocked. Hoon Jae...

173
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,950
got hurt a bit. Now he is better.

174
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,590
Got hurt?

175
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,500
You scared me.

176
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,320
But why didn't you tell me? You guys went to the hospital, just leaving me behind, right?

177
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,240
Not just you. We also left Hyeong Soon.

178
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,030
Also, so what if everyone went? <br>We just stood there and came back.

179
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,680
Mom, Hoon Jae's condition wasn't good at that time.

180
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,940
Oh I see. I didn't know that.

181
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,180
If people see this, they will think you are Mr. Fixit's biological sister. Just go slice that.

182
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,540
Where did my other pair go?

183
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,120
Are you going to work?

184
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,860
Yeah. Hey, did you see my dress shoes?

185
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,880
I didn't see it.

186
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,410
Where did it go?

187
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,960
Did you come back from opening the store?

188
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,150
Yes. Work hard.

189
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,010
Hyeong Soon.

190
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,290
Come here.

191
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,030
Use it where needed. Eat something delicious with Sister-in-law.

192
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,340
It is okay. I have money.

193
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,550
Just use it. You can't refuse.

194
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,730
I told you it is okay.

195
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,890
Hey, let me be a Hyung.

196
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,660
What's the point of giving it to someone like me?

197
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,260
Since you mess up all the time, I should be taking care of you. <br> Who else would if your own Hyung doesn't?

198
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,590
And keep your spirit up, punk.

199
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,030
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

200
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,170
Where did you leave Chae Ri and always have you two alone?

201
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,660
Our Daughter-In-Law Che Ri is so precious that we kept her in the lower hall. Why?

202
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,730
Your hair pin is pretty.

203
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,770
Your daughter made it for me.

204
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,670
That Hye Joo has no sense!

205
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,960
President.

206
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,320
Oh, you came again, Miss.

207
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,170
I told you you can't.

208
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,410
- Ok. <br> - What again?

209
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,990
Oppa Chool?

210
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,370
Right? Ok?

211
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,900
- Oppa! <br> - Aigo.

212
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,280
Hey Ok.

213
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,940
How long has it been?

214
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:25,570
So, you were the young miss who used to work in finance from the factory that Chool used to work.

215
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,520
Oppa Chool was very nice to me at that time.

216
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,290
Oppa Chool?

217
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,610
You are also Ok, Miss? She is Ok as well.

218
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,390
My name is Han Eun Ok.

219
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,820
I guess she is Ok. San Ok and Eun Ok. It is funny.

220
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,560
It's "Ok" festival time!

221
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:03,850
So my children's father called you "Ok" "Ok" at that time?

222
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,640
Yes.

223
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,740
Ok, during that time, Ok was a child.

224
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,070
So I called "Ok" "Ok"...

225
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,600
Is the heater too high? It's hot.

226
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,320
I told Daughter-in-law to come to the shop. <br> Where is she?

227
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,380
Ok! Drink coffee before you leave.

228
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,290
Ok! Ok!

229
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,160
Don't be like that, Noona.

230
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,410
The the person who graduated the vocational school was that shorty?

231
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,900
Oh, now I remember. When Lee Dong Chool used to grease up his hair

232
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,120
and used tons of perfume on his hair, it was about that time.

233
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,430
When he used to work at the factory.

234
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,870
Since we are in this situation, you still are not going to hire me?

235
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,180
What?

236
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,120
I mean, you rejected me because I come off as a cold person.

237
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,250
But since you know I know Chool Oppa,

238
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,130
can't you reconsider?

239
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,660
The term "extenuating circumstance" shouldn't be used in this situation.

240
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,030
I think I already got hired.

241
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,880
Huh?

242
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,620
Yeah Noona, do Ok a favor.

243
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:00,530
Because Eun Ok graduated from the vocational school, she's fast with calculation.

244
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,940
Noona.

245
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,700
Seriously.

246
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,220
<i>Should I let that cunning In San Ok get burned with jealousy?</i>

247
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,880
But Ok, you got married, right?

248
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,470
Excuse me?

249
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,820
Hello.

250
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,420
Hi Oppa.

251
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
You came early.

252
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,190
Working here is a bit difficult.

253
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,800
Huh?

254
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,850
<i>The thing that I like is...</i>

255
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,200
<i> Look here, look here. </i>

256
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,820
Yesterday, that..?

257
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,930
-<i> Can you do it?</i> <br>- Yes.

258
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,720
<i> You have to work hard. </i>

259
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,350
- You're hired. <br> - I will work hard.

260
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,070
Let's work well.

261
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,520
Hello? Oh yes, CEO! Yes, yes.

262
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,990
Yesterday, you're the anemic girl?

263
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,680
Yes.

264
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,770
Thank you for helping me yesterday Oppa.

265
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,110
It wasn't much. But you got a part-time job here?

266
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,720
Yes, starting today. Please take care of me.

267
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,810
Right, my name is Eng Du (Cherry). Go Eng Du.

268
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,260
Eng Du.

269
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,560
Around me, why Cherry and Eng Du?

270
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,240
- What's your name? <br> - Oh, my name is

271
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,620
- <i> Lee Hyeong Soon </i> <br> - It's Lee Hyeong Soon .

272
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,460
Hyeong Soon.

273
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,530
Since you took off the patient gown, you look much better. Now, you seem like my nephew.

274
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,220
Isn't that so? This is better.

275
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,870
Excuse me.

276
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,500
Chae Ri.

277
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,740
<i> Cheol Woong Oppa's daughter? </i>

278
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,440
I heard you got heard. I just found out this morning.

279
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
Is that so?

280
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,510
Did it hurt a lot?

281
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,860
Well, when I got injured, it hurt a little but I'm okay now.

282
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,400
Did you come here because of me?

283
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,480
Yes. I was worried about you.

284
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,720
<i>Oh, my look at her. I guess blood relatives do attract each other.</i>

285
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,530
You shouldn't have come since you are with a baby.

286
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,150
Are you okay?

287
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,900
<i>She's pregnant?</i>

288
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,050
I'm okay.

289
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,360
Even still, it's a relief that I got to see you before you left.

290
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,490
Yes, that's a relief.

291
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,200
Chae Ri.

292
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,220
Are you doing well?

293
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:24,740
Did you come because Hoon Jae Oppa is your employee?

294
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,880
Yeah. That's right.

295
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,020
I heard from Lee Jin Ae that you're doing well.

296
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,740
Yes, everyone is good to me.

297
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,820
It isn't uncomfortable?

298
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,220
I'm not uncomfortable.

299
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,430
Mother-in-law cooks well so everything I eat is delicious. I eat so much

300
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,030
I gained some weight.

301
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,310
Your face looks well. That's good.

302
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,230
Right, Hyeong Soon Oppa got a job.

303
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,730
Where?

304
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,060
He's working at a BBQ restaurant as a part timer.

305
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,390
If his working ability get's recognized, he says he can become a full time employee.

306
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:48,320
Dad, don't worry. We will do well.

307
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,010
Dad.

308
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,980
Should I tell Chauffeur Oh to drive you?

309
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,680
No. You said you won't help with anything anymore.

310
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,780
You said I'm a stranger.

311
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,830
Why would you offer a ride to someone you don't know?

312
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,750
I will be going now. Stay healthy.

313
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Are you leaving now?

314
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,990
Yes. <br> Aunt, please go to the car first.

315
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,550
Okay.

316
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,990
What about Chae Ri?

317
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,020
I haven't said anything yet.

318
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,130
Yes. Chae Ri is pregnant so it wouldn't be good to shock her with such news.

319
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:15,790
For coming to the hospital and watching over me, thank you.

320
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:21,200
But you can just end it here.

321
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,130
I got hurt due to work.

322
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,350
I think of this as you being concerned due to that.

323
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,930
Thank you.

324
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,770
Hoon Jae.

Where did you go during lunch?

327
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,970
Since it was lunch time, I took personal time.

328
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,810
What did you do?

329
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,830
I got my hair done at the salon.

330
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,260
<i> Since you're going on a blind date today?</i>

331
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,470
My hair turned out well, right?

332
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,540
- No. <br> - What?

333
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:41,530
Somehow it doesn't suit you too well. Shall I say it's like a country bumpkin?

334
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,950
This is the newest style.

335
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,860
Since not anyone can handle the newest style.

Did you have my number saved?

340
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,150
Of course. Isn't it a right manner to show to a person who met on a blind date?

341
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,360
You don't look like someone with manners.

342
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,280
It's a joke. Look here.

343
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,160
You know how we both decided to reject each other. Let's forget about that.

344
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,310
The meaning of forgetting it is...

345
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:30,480

347
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,900
Sure, let's do that. Shall we meet today?

Sounds good. Where shall we meet?

349
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,800
I will let you know. Then see you later.

350
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,170

Lunch time is over.

352
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,220
What?

353
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,160
Shouldn't it apply to you that when lunch time is over, you can't use personal time?

354
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,350
As the boss, you should set an example.

355
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,710
Your hair doesn't suit you. You should get it redone.

356
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,940
Did you discharge well?

357
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:01,430
Yes. Right now, I'm comfortably sitting on my bed.

358
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,770
Did Hoon Jae get discharged?

359
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,760
That's good news.

360
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,090
I miss you.

361
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:17,540
Shall we see each other at night? <br> No, I'm not hurting anymore.

362
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,900
Mother.

363
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,800
- Jin Ae, I'll talk to you later. <br>- Okay.

364
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,920
Mother, at this time..?

365
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,760
My son has been discharged so I wanted to stop by.

366
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,500
Mother.

367
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,470
Son, thank you for getting well so quickly.

368
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,170
You worried a lot, huh? I'm sorry.

369
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,050
Your face isn't well, Mother.

370
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,790
Really?

371
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,470
Yeah. I'm serious.

372
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,730
I'll approve of your marriage with Assistant Manager Lee.

373
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,620
Mother.

374
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,340
Mother, thank you.

375
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,530
Last time, I told you, right?

376
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:45,410
The reason I can't forgive CEO Jang,

377
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:52,090
is because he couldn't change his mother's mind and gave up on me.

378
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:04,370
But I couldn't do that to you.

379
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,200
Mother, I'm really

380
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,640
really thankful. I will be better to you.

381
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,010
Jin Ae will do well too.

382
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,360
Mother, thank you.

383
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,390
You like it that much?

384
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:34,660
Okay. Since you like it, I like it too.

385
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,890
Put the meat at the end.

386
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:54,460
The vegetables in the middle. <br> That's what you have to do.

387
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,250
How do you use this Oppa?

388
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,070
For this, you rotate this to turn it on.

389
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:07,200
To clean it, you move it to the left.

390
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,240
Something must have went in my eye Oppa.

391
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,880
Can you blow in it please?

392
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,930
Where?

393
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,800
I haven't blown yet. Come here.

394
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,650
Oppa!

395
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,770
Chae Ri.

396
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,720
How could you point my eye Oppa?

397
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,470
Sorry, are you hurt?

398
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,690
Oppa, what are you doing right now?

399
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:48,990
- Eng Du said something went in her eye.<br>- Eng Du?

400
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,660
You! You're the fake girl from yesterday.

401
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,120
- F-Fake? <br> - I see.

402
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,340
You came here to meet my oppa, huh?

403
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,590
What are you saying Unni?

404
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:07,110
Chae Ri, what are you doing? You're embarrassing.

405
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,650
She's here again.

406
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,420
Aishee.

407
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,710
What? You want to work here too?

408
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,390
I have to stay right next to you. This won't do.

409
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,890
Who? Do I just meet the CEO?

410
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,300
Hey, hey, hey. You have to be careful because of baby lamb. What can you do here?

411
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,220
- I'm okay. <br> - How are you okay when you're pregnant?

412
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,440
- I'm not pregnant. <br> - What?

413
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,900
What are you saying?

414
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,860
Huh?

415
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,460
You, you you.

416
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,420
You're just saying you're not pregnant, right?

417
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,590
You think I'm going to stay still?

418
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,190
Then what do I do?

419
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,430
Girls keep chasing after you.

420
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,190
Chasing what? I was trying to help her.

421
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,830
But why did she have to get a job here?

422
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,360
- It was a coincidence. <br> - I have a feeling it wasn't a coincidence!

423
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,040
How can you?

424
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,540
- How can you what? <br>- How can you be just like my mom?

425
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,300
You're the same when Mom catches Dad.

426
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,430
Me?

427
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,460
Oppa.

428
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,850
- The CEO is calling you. <br> - Okay, I'll be there.

429
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:42,210
Chae Ri, let's go home.

430
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,490
Should I call a taxi?

431
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,730
Chae Ri, I have to work.

432
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,230
Okay. I'll go.

433
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,170
But why did you come here?

434
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,410
-You came to spy on me?<br>-No, I just got sad.

435
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,830
I ran into Dad a while ago.

436
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,390
Is that so?

437
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,160
Chae Ri, I don't have a dinner shift,

438
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,520
so I will go home early and make you something delicious.

439
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,520
Also, don't be so upset with me.

440
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,950
In here, there's no one but Chae Ri.

441
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,130
Chae Ri, Chae Ri, Chae Ri, there's no one but Chae Ri.

442
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,230
Aigo.

443
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,590
I'm not pregnant?

444
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:59,530
Even though it didn't show on the test, I was hoping I was.

445
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,290
I heard it can happen if you're not pregnant for that long.

446
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,630
But why did it not show a sign?

447
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,650
Also, why I felt like I was pregnant?

448
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,790
It may be that you

449
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:20,530
had a high desire to be pregnant.

450
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:25,790
<i>Do you want a baby very badly right now?</i>

451
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,610
I did want a baby so much.

452
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,410
If I have a child,

453
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,180
I thought Dad would approve.

454
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,780
Since I knew everyone would accept (me).

455
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,960
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Mom Knows Best Team @ Viki </i>

456
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,440
Mother-in-law.

457
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,810
Aigo, why is a child's mom sitting on the cold cement?

458
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,670
- Use this to sit. <br> - It's okay.

459
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,830
Sit here.

460
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,490
I heard you went to see Mr. Fix It.

461
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,930
I got a call asking if you got home safely.

462
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,450
Aigo, why did you go there?

463
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:30,950
But why are you sitting here?

464
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,440
Are you frustrated?

465
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,420
- No<br> - Maybe your morning sickness is going to start.

466
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,880
You don't feel nauseous or anything yet, right?

467
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,460
Yes.

468
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,140
- Mother...<br> - Look at that fake girl.

469
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,560
Who is she?

470
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,350
Someone.

471
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,710
A sly fox that's dripping with fake shyness.

472
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,880
I have someone like that too.

473
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,050
It's time to leave.

474
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,340
Where is your blind date?

475
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,370
- Why? <br> - Just because.

476
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,830
If it's a secret then it's fine.

477
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,140
What's this? You just lost interest?

478
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,810
I don't want to go on a blind date.

479
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,730
Wow, I'm lonely.

480
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm so lonely.

481
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,290
Christmas is sparkling.

482
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,590
There's no one to keep me

483
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,700
warm.

484
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,380
Wait a minute. She should be here.

485
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,390
Here.

486
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,740
No, no.

487
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,670
This isn't it.

488
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,850

Yes, my name is Kim Sa— No, it's not.

No, no, my name is...

Yes, Jun Yeon..

Ah, ah.

505
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,200
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

506
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,660
<i>Yes.</i>

507
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,730
<i> You think I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me? </i>

508
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,430
<i> Of course he would want to meet in his own store.</i>

509
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,000
<i>So he can show off.</i>

510
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,930
Would you like some tea? Tea? What kind?

511
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,350
Yes, then...

512
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,650
I'll have some Earl Grey.

513
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:59,300
- Earl Grey.<br>- Earl Grey.

514
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,020
That's good.

515
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:07,530
Excuse me.

516
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:12,780
Earl Grey.

517
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,960
We're going to eat all of this?

518
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,810
Yes, our cake is very delicious.

519
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,640
I wanted you to sample them.

520
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,880
Eat.

521
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,320
We're going to eat dinner later.

522
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,910
Of course we should eat.

523
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,520
So this is

524
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,170
the appetizer.

525
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,570

♬ <i>May be my treasure or the price I have to pay</i> ♬

528
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,840
♬ <i>She may be the song the summer sings</i> ♬

529
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,400
That human, really?

530
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,180
Lawyer Lee.

531
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,890
Lawyer?

532
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,770
How could you be here when we were supposed to meet at the other store?

533
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:33,280
What happened was, I stopped by here and was going to go.

534
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,950
But how did you know I was here?

535
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,190
I was sitting over there and saw you here.

536
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,330
I was confused so I came here.

537
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,150
What? Wait,

538
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,050
you can see from there? <br> - Of course.

539
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,590
I have really good eye sight.

540
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:00,790
Ah, who's causing a commotion. They have no manners.

541
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh! Hyeong Gyu.

542
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,550
Hyeong Gyu, it's been a while.

543
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,920
Yes.

544
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,750
Oh! San's mother!

545
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:20,190
We see each other again. We're destined to meet.

546
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:25,930
You two know each other?

547
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,190
Come here for a bit.

548
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,760
Seeing

549
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,780
like this again, we should shake.

550
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,820
Again?

551
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,550
Ah yes. Is Jin Ae doing well?

552
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,070
Yes. She's going to get married.

553
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,410
I think I'm going to get married too.

554
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,420
What?

555
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,210
Introduce yourself to my future wife.

556
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,630
- What? <br> - What?! Mr. Kim.

557
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,220
Well,

558
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,650
Hye Joo,

559
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,100
I liked you from first sight.

560
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,210
We should just start a relationship.

561
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,830
San's mother has a family.

562
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,200
Ah, Hye Joo is single with a kid.

563
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,440
I am single with a kid too. We're both single with kids.

564
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,390
- Ah, you two suit each other well. <br> - Isn't that right?

565
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,400
We're well suited.

566
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,220
But what's your relationship?

567
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,860
We're having blind dates but we're considering a relationship.

568
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,210
Ah, if that's so

569
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,260
you must have a profession.<br>-What?

570
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,460
See, Hyeong Gyu is famous for only meeting women with a profession.

571
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,550
Or you have some land or something.

572
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,560
Hyeong gyu, you achieved your dream after all.

573
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,160
A woman with a profession!

574
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,950
Hyung, I did what?

575
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,100
Since meeting like this way is fate, let's share the same table.

576
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,170
Let's have dinner together.

577
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,200
- I'll pay. <br> - That would be great. <br> - No.

578
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,470
- Then let's go. <br> - Yes.

579
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,570
- Excuse me. <br> - Excuse me.

580
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,780
Aigoo, here...

581
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,690
Over here please!

582
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,850
Yes?

583
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,660
Instead of this, please bring more.

584
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,430
A big bucket full.

585
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:02,610
If the table isn't full, I don't have an appetite.

586
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,790
You won't be able to eat it all.

587
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,550
Believe me.

588
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,310
I am limitless!

589
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,450
Yes.

590
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,240
Omo, you came again?

591
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,020
Eat deliciously.

592
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,250
Mom!

593
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh.

594
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,530
Mother-In-law, hello.

595
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,260
In-law?

596
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,920
Aigo.

597
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,960
Are there inconvenient issues with my building?

598
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,890
Yes, well..

599
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,860
<i> That's your mother. </i>

600
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,900
That's Hyeong Gyu.

601
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,560
San Ok, is that dentist Hyeong gyu met on the blind date?

602
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,430
Yeah, he said he wouldn't see her but I guess they're meeting again.

603
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,890
Omo, hello Madam.

604
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,850
Mother.

605
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:27,760
It's been a while.

606
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,470
It's been a while Mr. Kim.

607
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,970
How...?

608
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,450
Are you on your date with Hye Joo?

609
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:42,460
Yes, yes. I heard you hooked us up.

610
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,700
Thank you.

611
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:52,790
For the next 3 years, I will not increase the rent to Madam Im.

612
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:56,630
I just spoke about it.

613
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,090
Hello, are you Hyeong Gyu's mother?

614
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:04,430
Hyeong Gyu looks just like you. I'm Choi So Yeon.

615
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,560
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

616
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,780
How did you come here?

617
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,950
I wanted to see Hyeong Gyu again so I told me we should meet.

618
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,590
<i>Is that so? </i>

619
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:22,020
So what do you think after meeting him again?

620
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:26,460
I'm alright with him.

621
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,810
With Hyeong Gyu, I'm not sure.

622
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,090
- I'm... <br> - Anyways, please take care of me, Mother.

623
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,600
- I will stop by to say hi often. <br> - Okay, come visit.

624
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,720
Wait a moment. Today

625
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,180
Today, it's how I feel!

626
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,610
I will ring this golden bell.

627
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:57,220
All the customers who came in today, I will pay for your meals.

628
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,880
Mother-in-law, please give me all the chicken from today.

629
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,170
Everything? Omo.

630
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,750
Your chicken is really delicious.

631
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:20,340
What the heck. Fry up everything. Everything!

632
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,280
President Kim, don't you think you are overdoing it?

633
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,600
No.

634
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,500
If it's for Hye Joo, I can do anything.

635
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,780
President Kim sure does things with a gusto.

636
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,720
It must be nice.

637
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,770
Eat as much as you want. As much as you want.

638
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,810
<i> He must have a lot of money. </i>

639
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,210
Yeah, fry up everything. Everything.

640
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,930
Hoon Jae should be cold right now.

641
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,250
- Jin Ae. <br> - Oh!

642
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,690
Hoon Jae. How did you come here?

643
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,310
Am I kid? How could I not get here?

644
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,730
You were just discharged. <br>How could you be walking around like this?

645
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,700
It's okay. I didn't drive and I took the taxi.

646
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,650
I have good news to share.

647
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,530
Good news?

648
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:24,390
Mother approved of our marriage.

649
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,420
Really? Really?!

650
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,820
Really.

651
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,630
Hoon Jae.

652
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,820
We can get married now.

653
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,490
Jin Ae.

654
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,690
We should get married quickly.

655
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,220
Let's get married quickly.

656
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,090
Mr. Fix It!

657
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,800
Engineer Kang.

658
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,960
Mother, Father, hello.

659
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,040
Aigo, I heard you got discharged.

660
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,220
Even if you're discharged, <br>you should be taking care of your body.

661
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,850
I'm okay now.

662
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,950
I heard you stopped by the hospital.

663
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:12,320
Even though you miss Jin Ae, <br>how could you come here at night?

664
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,990
I wanted to see Mother and Father. <br> Also, I have something to tell you.

665
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,230
Huh? What do you need to say?

666
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,550
Marriage?

667
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:30,040
So now you two can get married?

668
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:32,230
Yes, Father-in-law.

669
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:37,500
Wow, finally. Finally.

670
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,870
Our CEO has changed her mind.

671
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:47,200
Aigo, Jin Ae, you like it, huh?

672
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,080
Yes, Dad.

673
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:59,040
- Mom. <br> - Mother-in-law.

674
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:07,000
So? Your CEO allowed the marriage,

675
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,410
so I should applause and dance?

676
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,110
I am sorry but now I can't give permission.

677
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,790
Honey, why are you changing your mind?

678
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,920
I also told you, right?

679
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:28,450
Until your mother apologize for what she said to Jin Ae, I can't approve of this marriage.

680
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,790
I can never.

681
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,500
Mom!

682
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,950
Why are you like this? It hurts.

683
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,200
Aren't you really too much?

684
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,200
You were waiting for CEO's approval to change your mind, huh?

685
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,730
After she approved, you were going to disapprove, right?

686
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,650
Aigoo, I was thinking about overturning the dinner table as soon as it was set.

687
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,240
Since I'm not a parent who wants to see you do well, right?

688
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,270
Yeah.

689
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:10,330
Aigo, where is your pride? Did you pluck it out and move all the way over there?

690
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,830
After saying "I don't like you!"

691
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:20,750
Even after hearing that? Even after trying to send you far away like New York,

692
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,500
do you have feelings that you like?

693
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,110
Then what should I do? Hoon Jae and I came this far with so much difficulty.

694
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,300
So do I give up and say I'm not going to get married?

695
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:36,870
Hey, that CEO lady wanted her son <br>to get married to someone else.

696
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,410
When Mr. Fix It was laying in bed at the hospital <br>and we went to visit

697
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:45,290
some girl went in saying "Mother-in-law, Mother-in-law".

698
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:50,200
After seeing that, do you have happy feelings?

699
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,790
Then what do you want me to do?

700
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,020
Accept an apology. Get a promise.

701
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,710
We have to get a solid promise before we move forward. Do you know what kind of daughter you are?

702
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,020
You know what kind of daughter you are to me?

703
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,620
If somebody saw us now, they must think that we have an exceptional mother daughter relationship.

704
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,620
They may think that among our siblings, you must have loved me the most.

705
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,160
Why can't you answer?

706
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,460
I really don't understand why you are doing this now.

707
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,500
Why are you being like this and starting to care?

708
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:31,410
Anyways, I won't accept unless that happens.

709
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:38,720
You're my kid and I can do that but I can't see someone else mistreat you.

710
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:45,000
Hey, before you get married,

711
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,440
aigoo, even if she thinks there's no one better than her daughter-in-law,

712
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,440
once you get married, mother-in-laws are known to flip on you.

713
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:04,540
To someone who told you "I dislike you!" To that woman, how can I trust that woman?

714
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:14,160
Mother-in-law, I'm sorry. I was short minded.

715
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:19,790
I will make it so you two meet.

716
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,540
Mother-in-law.

717
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:35,790
Aigoo, there are no parents who can win against their child.

718
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,950
You had no choice.

719
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,450
I know, huh?

720
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:47,000
You should have accepted Assistant Manager Lee from the beginning.

721
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:51,940
I wanted to do that but my feelings weren't that way.

722
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:56,200
I know why you did that.

723
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,450
Why did I do that?

724
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:01,870
Hoon Jae likes Assistant Manager Lee more than you.

725
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,050
So you couldn't accept it.

726
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:10,310
That's why a long time ago, Cheol Woong Oppa's mother pushed you away too.

727
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:13,010
Because someone stole her precious son away from her.

728
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,370
Hey! I'm different from that Grandma.

729
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,450
Well, anyways,

730
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:23,700
even so, you didn't lose the game yet.

731
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,710
What are you saying?

732
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,840
Unni, now you are her mother-in-law.

733
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,540
You can do whatever you want with Assistant Manager Lee.

734
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:36,000
Hey. I'm not that type of Mother-in-law.

735
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,040
I don't think so.

736
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,450
Be quiet. Just drink this.

737
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:59,870
Doing this, you're to die for.

738
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:03,540
Killer?

739
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,550
You say such nonsense.

740
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:13,230
Mom, to that CEO, don't give in.

741
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:17,380
The way I see it, forestallment is important with that ahjumma.

742
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:23,620
Hey, but how could you speak less to me?

743
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,330
What? Mom?

744
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:29,300
Saying Mother-in-law, it seems like I'm not close to you.

745
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,580
And I don't have a mother.

746
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,200
So my Mother-in-law is my mom.

747
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,190
Mom, fighting.

748
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,790
Aigo. Aigo.

749
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,620
- Are you all ready? <br> - Yes.

750
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:55,870
I should clean Mom's heels.

751
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:02,790
Wow, our Ok, dressed like this, my mood is great.

752
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:06,740
Aigo, CEO doesn't compare.

753
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,700
I will be back.

754
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:16,860
Ok, that is... I know that you're upset and offended,

755
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:22,940
but still, try to be more positive.

756
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:27,440
Once you see her, you will have many thoughts.

757
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,950
While she was here, how she glared at our Jin Ae like this.

758
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:36,550
Those kind of things.

759
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:42,410
Also, when you speak, think of Jin Ae.

760
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:52,650
After she met Engineer Kang, she's been out of her mind and excited.

761
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:56,250
So you are telling me to keep my temper in check?

762
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,120
Okay, I won't turn the table over.

763
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:05,440
Ok, smile.

764
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,020
Smile.

765
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:13,450
Smile.

766
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,450
- Mom. <br> - What?

767
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:35,870
You know...don't do too much.

768
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:40,230
Why? You think I'll jeopardize the marriage?

769
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,250
Yes.

770
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,390
Leave. Leave.

771
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,450
<i>At the end, it happens like this. </i>

772
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,600
<i>Hwang Yeong Seon, you lost.</i>

773
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,620
Have you come?

774
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,440
You came early.

775
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,290
I just got here.

776
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:31,120
Hoon Jae has some work at the company so I think he is still at the company.

777
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,360
Yes, I heard.

778
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,080
Leave.

779
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,580
Assistant Manager Lee, why don't you stay as well? Hoon Jae will come one hour later.

780
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:49,910
No. As for today, I just want to talk to you alone.

781
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:55,410
Mom.

782
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:02,330
Yes, Assistant Manager Lee. Please leave.

783
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,300
Yes.

784
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,910
Please sit down.

785
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:26,290
