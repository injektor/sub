<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Young Oh.</font>

160
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,576
<font color="yellow">I know people like you very well.</font>

161
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,706
<font color="yellow">You're smart, you're a good speaker...</font>

162
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,576
<font color="yellow">and you adapt well to any circumstance.</font>

163
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,036
<font color="yellow">But don't try to do anything.</font>

164
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,236
<font color="yellow">It's just a waste of time.</font>

165
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:20,636
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

166
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,176
<font color="yellow">don't trust you.</font>

167
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:28,076
<font color="yellow">I trust this.</font>

168
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,136
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

169
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:32,976
<font color="yellow">Let's begin.</font>

170
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:35,606
<font color="yellow">State your name and occupation.</font>

171
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,436
<font color="yellow">Lee Young Oh.</font>

172
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:44,206
<font color="yellow">Neurosurgery specialist at Hyunsung Medical Centre.</font>

173
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:47,106
<font color="yellow">You were in Shim Eun Ha's hospital room...</font>

174
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,176
<font color="yellow">around 3pm on July 4, is that correct?</font>

175
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,436
<font color="yellow">That is correct.</font>

176
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,176
<font color="yellow">Why were you there?</font>

177
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,276
<font color="yellow">I was her attending physician.</font>

178
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:03,236
<font color="yellow">Did you use your position as her attending...</font>

179
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,206
<font color="yellow">to murder Shim Eun Ha?</font>

180
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,606
<font color="yellow">The surveillance video from the hallway...</font>

181
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,276
<font color="yellow">shows the time you left her room...</font>

182
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:15,406
<font color="yellow">coincides with when her heart stopped.</font>

183
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,206
<font color="yellow">What happened in that room?</font>

184
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:21,606
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Young Oh.</font>

185
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:25,776
<font color="yellow">Did you murder Shim Eun Ha?</font>

186
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:31,876
<font color="yellow">Say it.</font>

187
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,206
<font color="yellow">Suk Joo.</font>

188
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,106
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

189
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:53,376
<font color="yellow">We're the only ones in here.</font>

190
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,176
<font color="yellow">I won't listen to excuses. Don't try to run.</font>

191
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,906
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? You're scaring me.</font>

192
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,106
<font color="yellow">Is Ji An...</font>

193
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:03,706
<font color="yellow">involved with our research?</font>

194
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:13,206
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

195
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:18,736
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say she was involved with our research?</font>

196
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,076
<font color="yellow">I had to do something.</font>

197
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,106
<font color="yellow">What couldn't I do?</font>

198
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:27,076
<font color="yellow">They promised to put her on top of the donor list.</font>

199
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,876
<font color="yellow">Were Kang Chul Min...</font>

200
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:31,306
<font color="yellow">and the director...</font>

201
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:34,606
<font color="yellow">part of what you had to do?</font>

202
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,736
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

203
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:47,936
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Were they?</font>

204
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:03,676
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

205
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,036
<font color="yellow">Stop acting so high and mighty.</font>

206
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:14,236
<font color="yellow">You act all good and just, but you can't save my child.</font>

207
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:15,336
<font color="yellow">You can't make her better.</font>

208
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,476
<font color="yellow">How dare you judge me?</font>

209
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:20,876
<font color="yellow">What right do you have?</font>

210
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,136
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

211
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:30,876
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

212
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:34,906
<font color="yellow">I only...</font>

213
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,206
<font color="yellow">I only lived as Ji An's mum.</font>

214
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:39,446
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

215
00:17:58,236 --> 00:17:59,236
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

216
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,636
<font color="yellow">Have you heard? It's huge.</font>

217
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:07,906
<font color="yellow">Did the CS OP patient's scan results come out yet?</font>

218
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:08,946
<font color="yellow">You don't know, do you?</font>

219
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:11,076
<font color="yellow">The hospital is flipped upside down.</font>

220
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:17,306
<font color="yellow">What's more important than a patient's scan results?</font>

221
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:21,506
<font color="yellow">An allergy will delay surgery by a week.</font>

222
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:24,006
<font color="yellow">It's an aortic dissection patient. It's urgent.</font>

223
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,776
<font color="yellow">What if something goes wrong?</font>

224
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,576
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh was the killer.</font>

225
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:31,176
<font color="yellow">He was just arrested for the murders of...</font>

226
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:34,636
<font color="yellow">Kang Chul Min, Mr Shin and Dr Shim Eun Ha.</font>

227
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:37,176
<font color="yellow">He was?</font>

228
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:05,736
<font color="yellow">I didn't...</font>

229
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,376
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

230
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,136
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim.</font>

231
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:18,476
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

232
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:10,106
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

233
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:13,136
<font color="yellow">I killed them.</font>

234
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:16,636
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Young Oh.</font>

235
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:18,636
<font color="yellow">Dr Shim Eun Ha.</font>

00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:22,906
<font color="yellow">Director Shin Dong Jae.</font>

237
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:26,476
<font color="yellow">And Kang Chul Min, too.</font>

238
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:29,736
<font color="yellow">I killed...</font>

239
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,076
<font color="yellow">all of them.</font>

240
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,406
<font color="yellow">With Kang Chul Min...</font>

241
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,606

246
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:54,506
<font color="yellow">Without anyone knowing...</font>

247
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,606
<font color="yellow">or seeing.</font>

248
00:21:57,606 --> 00:21:58,606
<font color="yellow">It was perfect.</font>

249
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:03,176
<font color="yellow">I dreamed of the perfect murder.</font>

250
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,676
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

251
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:07,136
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

252
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:11,506
<font color="yellow">You call yourself a doctor?</font>

253
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,776
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

254
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,076
<font color="yellow">It's because monsters like you...</font>

255
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:18,406
<font color="yellow">are wealthy and powerful,</font>

256

00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:22,576
<font color="yellow">Detective.</font>

258
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:24,736
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

259
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,336
<font color="yellow">It may affect the results.</font>

260
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:31,906
<font color="yellow">Is it true?</font>

261
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,236
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Young Oh.</font>

262
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:37,336
<font color="yellow">Did you really kill...</font>

263
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:38,336
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

<font color="yellow">I didn't kill them.</font>

266
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:50,136
<font color="yellow">None of them.</font>

267
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:51,876
<font color="yellow">Lee Young Oh.</font>

268
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:53,776
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Young Oh.</font>

269
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:57,606
<font color="yellow">I am a murderer.</font>

270
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,706
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not a murderer.</font>

271
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:04,706
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

272
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,906
<font color="yellow">a doctor who highly values life.</font>

273
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:12,006
<font color="yellow">No. I don't value life at all.</font>

274
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:13,476
<font color="yellow">I'm not even a doctor.</font>

275
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,336
<font color="yellow">I am a man.</font>

276
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,036
<font color="yellow">Are you a woman?</font>

277
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:22,836
<font color="yellow">I am a human.</font>

278
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,676
<font color="yellow">I am not a human.</font>

279
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:27,806
<font color="yellow">Am I alive?</font>

280
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:32,706
<font color="yellow">- No, I am dead. - Stop it.</font>

281
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,576
<font color="yellow">- Let me ask again. - I...</font>

282
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:38,776
<font color="yellow">love you.</font>

283
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:44,006
<font color="yellow">You love me as well, right?</font>

284
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:47,976
<font color="yellow">We...</font>

285
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,336
<font color="yellow">made love...</font>

286
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:52,736
<font color="yellow">many times.</font>

287
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,106
<font color="yellow">In the ways that you wanted.</font>

288
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:58,706
<font color="yellow">Stop it right now!</font>

289
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:20,576
<font color="yellow">I warned you not to pull any tricks.</font>

290
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:23,276
<font color="yellow">I guess being nice to you doesn't work.</font>

291
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:24,836
<font color="yellow">Isn't this what you wanted...</font>

292
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:27,336
<font color="yellow">to see from me?</font>

293
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,706
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

294
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,906
<font color="yellow">Then let's start over.</font>

295
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,276
<font color="yellow">What? You punk!</font>

296
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:01,476
<font color="yellow">Is that possible?</font>

297
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:05,236
<font color="yellow">Because you're not a monster like I am,</font>

298
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,676
<font color="yellow">you people can feel...</font>

299
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:12,706
<font color="yellow">how much...</font>

300
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:17,036
<font color="yellow">pain another person is suffering.</font>

301
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:22,076
<font color="yellow">Let's try it.</font>

302
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:34,936
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

303
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:49,336
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

304
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:51,476
<font color="yellow">tell me.</font>

305
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:55,306
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

306
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,236
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

307
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:02,436
<font color="yellow">feel my pain?</font>

308
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:15,876
<font color="yellow">I just don't lie like that, that's all.</font>

309
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,936
<font color="yellow">I did not kill anyone.</font>

310
00:26:24,936 --> 00:26:26,136
<font color="yellow">You freak.</font>

311
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,806
<font color="yellow">We can't feel exactly what it is,</font>

312
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:52,906
<font color="yellow">but we can guess.</font>

313
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,336
<font color="yellow">They don't want it,</font>

314
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,806
<font color="yellow">and it doesn't help much,</font>

315
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,506
<font color="yellow">but you have to do something.</font>

316
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,506
<font color="yellow">Did that answer your question?</font>

317
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,636

<font color="yellow">he's probably making up millions of excuses to drink.</font>

476
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:12,936
<font color="yellow">I used to think...</font>

477
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:18,106
<font color="yellow">that the police investigate a murder...</font>

478
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:20,106
<font color="yellow">to catch the killer.</font>

479
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:24,436
<font color="yellow">What do you think now?</font>

480
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:27,806
<font color="yellow">Now, I think it's for those who are left behind.</font>

481
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:33,036
<font color="yellow">Because they need to know how the victims lived...</font>

482
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:36,006
<font color="yellow">and what they were like.</font>

483
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:40,076
<font color="yellow">It's so that they can treasure those memories.</font>

484
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:02,106
<font color="yellow">What are you staring at?</font>

485
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:08,506
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

486
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:11,976
<font color="yellow">I was thinking, I wish I could fill this up for him.</font>

487
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:17,376
<font color="yellow">You could help him out.</font>

488
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:23,236
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

489
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:25,306
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

490
00:41:27,176 --> 00:41:28,236
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

491
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:34,976
<font color="yellow">Isn't this pretty?</font>

492
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:38,506
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

493
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:40,906
<font color="yellow">It's 130cc.</font>

494
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,606
<font color="yellow">It's 20cc more than earlier.</font>

495
00:41:42,606 --> 00:41:44,206
<font color="yellow">It's 130cc now.</font>

496
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,276
<font color="yellow">This patient will live.</font>

497
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,276
<font color="yellow">He's my first patient.</font>

498
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,776
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

499
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:00,236
<font color="yellow">You're a first-year resident in Cardio, right?</font>

500
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:02,306
<font color="yellow">I've seen you in the OR.</font>

501
00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:06,106
<font color="yellow">Let's shake hands since we just met.</font>

502
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:10,636
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

503
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:14,236
<font color="yellow">Okay. I just...</font>

504
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:18,106
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Yoon Kyung from Anaesthesiology.</font>

505
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,506
<font color="yellow">You're so handsome.</font>

506
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:31,736
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

507
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:34,976
<font color="yellow">look after Ji An.</font>

508
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,606
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

509
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:50,846
<font color="yellow">when will the regenerative medicine...</font>

510
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:51,976
<font color="yellow">be put to practical use?</font>

511
00:42:54,636 --> 00:42:56,406
<font color="yellow">It should be done before the end of summer...</font>

512
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,536
<font color="yellow">so I get votes at the presidential election next year.</font>

513
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:02,006
<font color="yellow">Stem cells that create miracles.</font>

514
00:43:02,776 --> 00:43:04,006
<font color="yellow">The country with the best medical technology.</font>

515
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:06,346
<font color="yellow">A country with a strong economy.</font>

516
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:08,436
<font color="yellow">Who would make money...</font>

517
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:11,976
<font color="yellow">by using the stem cell technology?</font>

518
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:14,006
<font color="yellow">You should make money...</font>

519
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:17,306
<font color="yellow">by investing in biotechnology stocks.</font>

520
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:19,576
<font color="yellow">Treatment isn't what matters.</font>

521
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:21,736
<font color="yellow">What's important is the fact...</font>

522
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,706
<font color="yellow">that research is being conducted.</font>

523
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:25,176
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Mr Lee?</font>

524
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:29,976
<font color="yellow">Yes, but in order to proceed,</font>

525
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,576
<font color="yellow">we can't leave the director's seat vacant any longer.</font>

526
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:35,006
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

527
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:39,676
<font color="yellow">Hence, we'll make an internal announcement...</font>

528
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:41,436
<font color="yellow">I'll have someone submit my application.</font>

529
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:45,236
<font color="yellow">- What? - Are you saying...</font>

530
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:50,006
<font color="yellow">that you'll apply for the position, Mr Lee?</font>

531
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:52,436
<font color="yellow">Do I seem incompetent for the role?</font>

532
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:53,876
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

533
00:43:55,706 --> 00:43:56,876
<font color="yellow">People are...</font>

534
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,476
<font color="yellow">truly mysterious.</font>

535
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,406
<font color="yellow">I'm quite entertained.</font>

536
00:44:03,506 --> 00:44:06,136
<font color="yellow">I'll be returning to my work now.</font>

537
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:16,806
<font color="yellow">You have a strong competitor now, Mr Chae.</font>

538
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:18,336
<font color="yellow">It seems so.</font>

539
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,436
<font color="yellow">You could have notified me earlier.</font>

540
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:32,376
<font color="yellow">I wasn't aware of your ambition.</font>

541
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:35,776
<font color="yellow">Since you were close to Mr Shin,</font>

542
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,436
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd be interested in his position.</font>

543
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:39,606
<font color="yellow">Shin Dong Jae.</font>

544
00:44:41,706 --> 00:44:43,706
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this for Director Shin Dong Jae.</font>

545
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:47,736
<font color="yellow">I cannot allow the Regenerative Medical Centre...</font>

546
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,236
<font color="yellow">to be dragged into the political world...</font>

547
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:53,976
<font color="yellow">to become a stock market advertisement or voting bait.</font>

548
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,776
<font color="yellow">How will I be able to face him?</font>

549
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:03,306
<font color="yellow">I'm impressed by your deep friendship.</font>

550
00:45:04,176 --> 00:45:06,436
<font color="yellow">There must be someone to keep the chairman in check.</font>

551
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,576
<font color="yellow">That is the duty of the director's office.</font>

552
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,536
<font color="yellow">With all due respect,</font>

553
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,936
<font color="yellow">you must be aware of the hospital's state of affairs.</font>

554
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:19,606
<font color="yellow">Considering what happened to your son, Dr Lee Young Oh,</font>

555
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:22,606
<font color="yellow">do you think you'll be okay?</font>

556
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:25,576
<font color="yellow">Come on. Dr Lee Young Oh is coming this way.</font>

557
00:46:25,776 --> 00:46:26,876
<font color="yellow">It's Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

558
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:28,606
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

559
00:46:29,776 --> 00:46:30,776
<font color="yellow">Isn't he unbelievable?</font>

560
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:34,936
<font color="yellow">He's probably clueless...</font>

561
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:37,536
<font color="yellow">about how others view him right now, right?</font>

562
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:39,676
<font color="yellow">He must be aware. He's very intelligent.</font>

563
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:41,976
<font color="yellow">How can he conduct himself so normally?</font>

564
00:46:42,076 --> 00:46:44,776
<font color="yellow">It's only possible because he lacks empathy.</font>

565
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:50,536
<font color="yellow">Sir, can you hear me?</font>

566
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:53,336
<font color="yellow">Tell me the details.</font>

567
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,706
<font color="yellow">Male, 44 years old.</font>

568
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:57,876
<font color="yellow">He fell down the stairs on his way home with his wife.</font>

569
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:00,176
<font color="yellow">My wife...</font>

570
00:47:02,376 --> 00:47:04,476
<font color="yellow">Sir, do you know where you are? You're at the hospital.</font>

571
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:06,336
<font color="yellow">Where is my wife?</font>

572
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:09,306
<font color="yellow">My wife...</font>

573
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,636
<font color="yellow">Are there any other areas of discomfort, Sir?</font>

574
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:16,306
<font color="yellow">Good. I'll call an orthopedist for you.</font>

575
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:17,676
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

576
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:23,876
<font color="yellow">His physical state is abnormal.</font>

577
00:47:24,736 --> 00:47:26,206
<font color="yellow">He's been hospitalised for a long time...</font>

578
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:27,876
<font color="yellow">with multiple surgery scars.</font>

579
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:29,776
<font color="yellow">He also has biopsy markings.</font>

580
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:35,306
<font color="yellow">It's very likely that he's suffering from glioblastoma.</font>

581
00:47:40,906 --> 00:47:43,236
<font color="yellow">Please take him in for a CT scan.</font>

582
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:48,036
<font color="yellow">Sir, are you suffering from any medical conditions?</font>

583
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:51,976
<font color="yellow">Please call my wife. My wife...</font>

584
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:55,106
<font color="yellow">He said he was fine earlier.</font>

585
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,176
<font color="yellow">You're right. He has glioblastoma.</font>

586
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:10,906
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

587
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:14,106
<font color="yellow">It'll be over soon.</font>

588
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:17,736
<font color="yellow">You were frightened, right?</font>

589
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:24,206
<font color="yellow">He is suffering from glioblastoma.</font>

590
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:28,536
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang, please take him in for a CT scan.</font>

591
00:48:29,636 --> 00:48:30,836
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, excuse me.</font>

592
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,036
<font color="yellow">Considering the position of the surgical wound,</font>

593
00:48:34,636 --> 00:48:37,406
<font color="yellow">if the glioblastoma spreads to the medulla,</font>

594
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:39,306
<font color="yellow">even a minor haemorrhage...</font>

595
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:43,706
<font color="yellow">can be fatal.</font>

596
00:48:44,636 --> 00:48:46,106
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor. I'll be back.</font>

597
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:52,606
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

598
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,376
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

599
00:49:01,276 --> 00:49:02,336
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

600
00:49:03,336 --> 00:49:04,876
<font color="yellow">We're going home.</font>

601
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:09,236
<font color="yellow">You don't need to treat my husband.</font>

602
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:14,106
<font color="yellow">If he leaves now, he could die.</font>

603
00:49:15,306 --> 00:49:16,676
<font color="yellow">This is his will.</font>

604
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:22,306
<font color="yellow">And this is his advance directive.</font>

605
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:23,406
<font color="yellow">(Advance directive: Written statement...)</font>

606
00:49:23,406 --> 00:49:24,606
<font color="yellow">(of a person's wishes regarding medical treatment)</font>

607
00:49:24,636 --> 00:49:27,536
<font color="yellow">He's decided not to take any treatments...</font>

608
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:29,036
<font color="yellow">to prolong his life.</font>

609
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:34,436
<font color="yellow">He also entrusted the decision on treatments to me.</font>

610
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:37,506
<font color="yellow">I've made my decision.</font>

611
00:49:38,806 --> 00:49:40,936
<font color="yellow">I don't want him to receive any more treatments.</font>

612
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:49,606
<font color="yellow">Does the patient agree with you?</font>

613
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:53,206
<font color="yellow">Please do...</font>

614
00:49:54,836 --> 00:49:56,106
<font color="yellow">as my wife says.</font>

615
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:01,206
<font color="yellow">You did well.</font>

616
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:03,736
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of you.</font>

617
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:10,576
<font color="yellow">Are you satisfied?</font>

618
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:17,306
<font color="yellow">Sir, listen to me carefully.</font>

619
00:50:18,176 --> 00:50:22,336
<font color="yellow">If you leave without treatment, you could die.</font>

620
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:24,406
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that clearly?</font>

621
00:50:25,076 --> 00:50:26,936
<font color="yellow">I said, you could die.</font>

622
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,876
<font color="yellow">He shows overwhelming signs of fear and stress.</font>

623
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:38,506
<font color="yellow">He needs someone to trust.</font>

624
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,976
<font color="yellow">It's what he wants.</font>

625
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:49,236
<font color="yellow">He's suppressing his emotions and hiding what he feels.</font>

626
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:54,036
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

627
00:50:56,176 --> 00:50:59,506
<font color="yellow">I'll save your life no matter what.</font>

628
00:51:00,276 --> 00:51:01,276
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

629
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:12,036
