00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,620
<font color="yellow">Why did she run away? Why?</font>

162
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

163
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,220
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep doing this to me?</font>

164
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,720
<font color="yellow">What am I to you?</font>

165
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,150
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

166
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,650
<font color="yellow">enjoy teasing me?</font>

167
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,420
<font color="yellow">Am I a joke to you?</font>

168
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,890
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

169
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,420
<font color="yellow">what that woman would probably want to say.</font>

170
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,820
<font color="yellow">- I see.
-  Yes.</font>

171
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,750
<font color="yellow">That is why I need you,</font>

172
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,090
<font color="yellow">Detective Gye Jin Sung.</font>

173
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,390
<font color="yellow">You're sort of like my Wi-Fi.</font>

174
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,990
<font color="yellow">Wi-Fi?</font>

175
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,690
<font color="yellow">The patient's feelings that you read and relayed...</font>

176
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,270
<font color="yellow">was a huge help in my treating him.</font>

177
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,890
<font color="yellow">That is why I'd like to call it Wi-Fi.</font>

178
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,750
<font color="yellow">I should...</font>

179
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,390
<font color="yellow">be happy, right?</font>

180
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,490
<font color="yellow">Do as you wish.</font>

181
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,060
<font color="yellow">It's your emotions.</font>

182
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,090
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I came to say one thing.</font>

183
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,120
<font color="yellow">In the future,</font>

184
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,540
<font color="yellow">I'll be expecting your assistance.</font>

185
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,970
<font color="yellow">When I need Wi-Fi...</font>

186
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,950
<font color="yellow">for the patient's sake,</font>

187
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,820
<font color="yellow">whether you're at the precinct or anywhere else,</font>

188
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,920
<font color="yellow">I will go to you.</font>

189
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,720
<font color="yellow">So don't be surprised...</font>

190
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,320
<font color="yellow">or ignore me like you did today.</font>

191
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,990
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

192
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,720
<font color="yellow">Okay, good.</font>

193
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,050
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

194
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
<font color="yellow">You didn't...</font>

195
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,950
<font color="yellow">win anything.</font>

196
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,790
<font color="yellow">Lee Young Oh.</font>

197
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,750
<font color="yellow">You said his name is Lee Young Oh, right?</font>

198
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,320
<font color="yellow">Isn't it interesting?</font>

199
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,150
<font color="yellow">This is the CT scan of young Lee Young Oh...</font>

200
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,290
<font color="yellow">who received surgery from Lee Gun Myung.</font>

201
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,520
<font color="yellow">Would you look...</font>

202
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,090
<font color="yellow">carefully at the frontal lobe?</font>

203
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,890
<font color="yellow">If medical technology had been advanced as it is now,</font>

204
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,190
<font color="yellow">this would never have occurred.</font>

205
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,690
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

206
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,120
<font color="yellow">I'd like to see...</font>

207
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,750
<font color="yellow">how my old friend...</font>

208
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,050
<font color="yellow">would react when he sees me.</font>

209
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,150
<font color="yellow">Both Lee Gun Myung...</font>

210
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,950
<font color="yellow">and Lee Young Oh.</font>

211
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,120
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

212
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,290
<font color="yellow">My junior alumnus from grade school,</font>

213
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,120
<font color="yellow">which prides itself in tradition and fame.</font>

214
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,150
<font color="yellow">I heard you got dizzy and fainted at school.</font>

215
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,250
<font color="yellow">Why don't you lie down on your way to the ER?</font>

216
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,020
<font color="yellow">- Mister.
-  Hey.</font>

217
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,030
<font color="yellow">Mister? Mister?</font>

218
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,520
<font color="yellow">I'm not that old.</font>

219
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,830
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to call me by my name,</font>

220
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,120
<font color="yellow">you don't have to, but what? "Mister"?</font>

221
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,120
<font color="yellow">How old do you think I am?</font>

222
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,650
<font color="yellow">How smart do you have to be to go to medical school?</font>

223
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,850
<font color="yellow">I heard if I get a head start with math now,</font>

224
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,420
<font color="yellow">I might have more time...</font>

225
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,390
<font color="yellow">to study science in middle school.</font>

226
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,850
<font color="yellow">- My mum said that.
-  Your mum said that?</font>

227
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,920
<font color="yellow">What kind of a question is that...</font>

228
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,520
<font color="yellow">for a grade school student?</font>

229
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,350
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to medical school?</font>

230
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,650
<font color="yellow">Then do as your mum says.</font>

231
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,940
<font color="yellow">You'll get into medical school.</font>

232
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,220
<font color="yellow">I don't know if you'll be happy,</font>

233
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,720
<font color="yellow">but good luck anyway.</font>

234
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,350
<font color="yellow">We'll be grade school and college alumni.</font>

235
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,850
<font color="yellow">Come on, now.</font>

236
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,990
<font color="yellow">Doctor, please.</font>

237
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,530
<font color="yellow">Must you play so rough with a kid?</font>

238
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,350
<font color="yellow">What? What did I...</font>

239
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,520
<font color="yellow">You're such a weakling. Here.</font>

240
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,720
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Where's my child?</font>

241
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,320
<font color="yellow">He's a grade school student.</font>

242
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,960
<font color="yellow">He's wearing his uniform.</font>

243
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,390
<font color="yellow">The school said they sent him to the hospital.</font>

244
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,660
<font color="yellow">What's his name?</font>

245
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,820
<font color="yellow">It's Choi Yo Seob. Choi Yo Seob.</font>

246
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,790
<font color="yellow">Oh. The future medical student.</font>

247
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,990
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob!</font>

248
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,920
<font color="yellow">- Yo Seob.
-  Mum.</font>

249
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,350
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

250
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,890
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

251
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,590
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

252
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,660
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

253
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,040
<font color="yellow">You can't leave yet.</font>

254
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,940
<font color="yellow">He's going to get a CT scan now.</font>

255
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,420
<font color="yellow">Once he's done,</font>

256
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,820
<font color="yellow">please speak with his doctor. You may leave after that.</font>

257
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
<font color="yellow">It won't take long.</font>

258
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,090
<font color="yellow">He has to get to his academy. We don't have time.</font>

259
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

260
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,150
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

261
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,350
<font color="yellow">His head hurts a lot. Aren't you worried?</font>

262
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,990
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to know why it hurts?</font>

263
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,050
<font color="yellow">It's an act.</font>

264
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,650
<font color="yellow">It's finals week.</font>

265
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,890
<font color="yellow">Kids always get headaches during these times.</font>

266
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,920
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

267
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,250
<font color="yellow">Let the doctor do the diagnosis.</font>

268
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,920
<font color="yellow">Doctor. She's his guardian.</font>

269
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,390
<font color="yellow">Only doctors can judge whether or not...</font>

270
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,950
<font color="yellow">your son is pretending to be in pain.</font>

271
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,220
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

272
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,990
<font color="yellow">Parents mistakenly think...</font>

273
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,020
<font color="yellow">they know everything about their child.</font>

274
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,490
<font color="yellow">I decide whether or not to entrust him...</font>

275
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,120
<font color="yellow">with that doctor.</font>

276
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,720
<font color="yellow">I'm his parent.</font>

277
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,690
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob!</font>

278
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

279
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,320
<font color="yellow">The subdural haemorrhage is progressing quickly.</font>

280
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,790
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang, call Radiology...</font>

281
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,150
<font color="yellow">and prepare for surgery.</font>

282
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,750
<font color="yellow">- It is an emergency surgery.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

283
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,750
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob.</font>

284
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,350
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

285
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob.</font>

286
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,920
<font color="yellow">Please wait out here.</font>

287
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

288
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,120
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob is in the hospital...</font>

289
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,490
<font color="yellow">No. It's nothing serious.</font>

290
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,790
<font color="yellow">Get back to work.</font>

291
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,720
<font color="yellow">Wait. Doctor.</font>

292
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,890
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob will be fine, right?</font>

293
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,390
<font color="yellow">He has to be.</font>

294
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,690
<font color="yellow">I heard he got dizzy and fainted at school.</font>

295
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,250
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

296
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,890
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

297
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,920
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm always with him at school.</font>

298
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,650
<font color="yellow">Didn't you talk as if you knew everything about him?</font>

299
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,390
<font color="yellow">We'll know once surgery's over.</font>

300
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,550
<font color="yellow">We'll know just what's been happening to the child.</font>

301
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

302
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
<font color="yellow">Forceps.</font>

303
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,820
<font color="yellow">This is totally...</font>

304
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,520
<font color="yellow">I've never seen black blood before.</font>

305
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,420
<font color="yellow">How did such a young kid...</font>

306
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,920
<font color="yellow">Subdural haemorrhage.</font>

307
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,110
<font color="yellow">The hematoma...</font>

308
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,620
<font color="yellow">progressed slowly and bruised repeatedly...</font>

309
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,750
<font color="yellow">for a prolonged period of time.</font>

310
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,020
<font color="yellow">If he had left the hospital,</font>

311
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
<font color="yellow">this child...</font>

312
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,390
<font color="yellow">would have died.</font>

313
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,150
<font color="yellow">His BP is back to normal.</font>

314
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
<font color="yellow">It's looking good.</font>

315
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,550
<font color="yellow">His vitals are all stable.</font>

316
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,390
<font color="yellow">The swelling went down quickly.</font>

317
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,890
<font color="yellow">Doctor,</font>

318
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,360
<font color="yellow">why did you shave non-surgical sites?</font>

319
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,860
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang.</font>

320
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,980
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

321
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,120
<font color="yellow">Next time, remember. Don't ask.</font>

322
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,550
<font color="yellow">People may lie,</font>

323
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,420
<font color="yellow">but the body cannot lie.</font>

324
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,720
<font color="yellow">If someone abused them,</font>

325
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,820
<font color="yellow">the traces must remain somewhere.</font>

326
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,050
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

327
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,750
<font color="yellow">Stem cell treatment drugs...</font>

328
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,190
<font color="yellow">that regenerate brain cells and heart muscle cells,</font>

329
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,660
<font color="yellow">which we thought was impossible.</font>

330
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,580
<font color="yellow">Our children may live in a time...</font>

331
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,690
<font color="yellow">without Alzheimer's or heart transplants.</font>

332
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,990
<font color="yellow">This has been Choi Sang Hyuk reporting.</font>

333
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,320
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  Thanks.</font>

334
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,500
<font color="yellow">That was a great closing.</font>

335
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,620
<font color="yellow">Children.</font>

336
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,490
<font color="yellow">It feels more real since you mentioned children.</font>

337
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,620
<font color="yellow">I'm a fan.</font>

338
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,190
<font color="yellow">You really are incredible,</font>

339
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,890
<font color="yellow">succeeding in stem cell regeneration.</font>

340
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,590
<font color="yellow">It's the success of every citizen of Korea.</font>

341
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,650
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung Regenerative Medicine Team...</font>

342
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,530
<font color="yellow">hopes to give the poor and sad...</font>

343
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,190
<font color="yellow">something to smile about.</font>

344
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,620
<font color="yellow">Even if it's for a brief moment.</font>

345
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,780
<font color="yellow">You mean like a gold medal won during the Olympics?</font>

346
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,050
<font color="yellow">- Correct.
-  We plan to begin...</font>

347
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,720
<font color="yellow">with selecting patients who are...</font>

348
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,890
<font color="yellow">worn out from poverty and treating them for free.</font>

349
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,550
<font color="yellow">That's what everyone does...</font>

350
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,790
<font color="yellow">to publicise themselves.</font>

351
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,820
<font color="yellow">It's a bit early for dinner,</font>

352
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,390
<font color="yellow">but it's the perfect time to get a drink.</font>

353
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,990
<font color="yellow">My apologies.</font>

354
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,550
<font color="yellow">Ever since I started doing the evening news,</font>

355
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,420
<font color="yellow">I don't make dinner plans.</font>

356
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,920
<font color="yellow">I don't qualify to be an exception, I guess.</font>

357
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,490
<font color="yellow">Don't bother.</font>

358
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,360
<font color="yellow">That's his secret...</font>

359
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,420
<font color="yellow">to being the best anchor for 10 years.</font>

360
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,420
<font color="yellow">He doesn't do favours and never misses the news.</font>

361
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,390
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

362
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,750
<font color="yellow">thank you.</font>

363
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

364
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,690
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone on TV so utterly rude?</font>

365
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,200
<font color="yellow">Why is he trying to act...</font>

366
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,210
<font color="yellow">like he's king in front of me?</font>

367
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,220
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

368
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,420
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired from restraining myself.</font>

369
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,320
<font color="yellow">- Would you like one?
-  Go ahead.</font>

370
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,550
<font color="yellow">That's right, you drink only coffee.</font>

371
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,750
<font color="yellow">Our commercials during his show...</font>

372
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,220
<font color="yellow">The moment we pull our commercials,</font>

373
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,920
<font color="yellow">they'll target us...</font>

374
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,990
<font color="yellow">with news briefs and other reports.</font>

375
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,220
<font color="yellow">He doesn't let go once he bites down.</font>

376
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,620
<font color="yellow">That's why the masses like him.</font>

377
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,190
<font color="yellow">They think he can't tell a lie.</font>

378
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,700
<font color="yellow">As you can see, even his personal life is spotless.</font>

379
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,820
<font color="yellow">What an annoying punk. He's boring, too.</font>

380
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,390
<font color="yellow">If Choi Sang Hyuk promotes our regenerative treatment,</font>

381
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,990
<font color="yellow">the nation's faith in it will rise.</font>

382
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,620
<font color="yellow">Did we finish finding the free treatment patients?</font>

383
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,190
<font color="yellow">Cho Kyung Tae. Male patient at the age of 46.</font>

384
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,990
<font color="yellow">He has myocardial asthenia.</font>

385
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,220
<font color="yellow">He wants to be in the stem cell treatment trial.</font>

386
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,090
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

387
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,620
<font color="yellow">25-year-old male.</font>

388
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,230
<font color="yellow">Seo In Chul.</font>

389
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,270
<font color="yellow">He's waiting for a heart transplant.</font>

390
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,590
<font color="yellow">Sir, is he your grandson?</font>

391
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,490
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

392
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,850
<font color="yellow">He's my son that we had after 30 years of marriage.</font>

393
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,400
<font color="yellow">Even if death comes for me,</font>

394
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,920
<font color="yellow">I cannot go.</font>

395
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,720
<font color="yellow">How could I leave my son here like this?</font>

396
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,350
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

397
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,950
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

398
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,690
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

399
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,190
<font color="yellow">let my son speak at least.</font>

400
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,520
<font color="yellow">That way, after I die,</font>

401
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,590
<font color="yellow">he can at least extend his life.</font>

402
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,850
<font color="yellow">You know that thing that they say creates miracles.</font>

403
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,120
<font color="yellow">That stem... Stem something.</font>

404
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,720
<font color="yellow">- Dr Song. Next patient.
-  Yes, Doctor.</font>

405
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,820
<font color="yellow">Please let us choose new trial subjects.</font>

406
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,790
<font color="yellow">"Regenerative treatment saved them."</font>

407
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,520
<font color="yellow">"They became happy and healthy."</font>

408
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,850
<font color="yellow">That's what we want to show.</font>

409
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,690
<font color="yellow">Not hope, which may never come.</font>

410
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,690
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

411
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,890
<font color="yellow">you don't believe our research will create miracles,</font>

412
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,620
<font color="yellow">do you?</font>

413
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,220
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that?</font>

414
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,090
<font color="yellow">- Is there something...
-  Stem cell treatment...</font>

415
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,920
<font color="yellow">will soon be in the market.</font>

416
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,320
<font color="yellow">It is no longer research.</font>

417
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
<font color="yellow">It is a product.</font>

418
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,720
<font color="yellow">We must raise the demand</font>

419
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
<font color="yellow">in the 200-million-dollar market...</font>

420
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,520
<font color="yellow">for the product.</font>

421
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,650
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you understand.</font>

422
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,350
<font color="yellow">That was pretty quick.</font>

423
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,990
<font color="yellow">He is a smart kid.</font>

424
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,120
<font color="yellow">He knows exactly who he is.</font>

425
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,590
<font color="yellow">It's hard...</font>

426
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,990
<font color="yellow">for people, especially for doctors,</font>

427
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,120
<font color="yellow">to be like that.</font>

428
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,590
<font color="yellow">After living all their lives in a white gown,</font>

429
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,190
<font color="yellow">they get delusional.</font>

430
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,320
<font color="yellow">Patients.</font>

431
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,990
<font color="yellow">Devotion.</font>

432
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
<font color="yellow">Conviction.</font>

433
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,390
<font color="yellow">They think they are noble.</font>

434
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,320
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

435
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,150
<font color="yellow">I didn't have what it took,</font>

436
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,520
<font color="yellow">so I decided to chase money and success.</font>

437
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,090
<font color="yellow">But I still think that I'm more decent,</font>

438
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,720
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

439
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
<font color="yellow">The anaesthesia should have worn out.</font>

440
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,490
<font color="yellow">Seeing how he's still sleeping,</font>

441
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,720
<font color="yellow">I'll have to operate again and wake him.</font>

442
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,690
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim. Choi Yo Seob...</font>

443
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,290
<font color="yellow">I'm awake.</font>

444
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,460
<font color="yellow">The anaesthesia wore out,</font>

445
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,950
<font color="yellow">but you pretended to be asleep in front of me.</font>

446
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,930
<font color="yellow">You're afraid of surgery,</font>

447
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,490
<font color="yellow">but you want to become a doctor...</font>

448
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,490
<font color="yellow">and make Mum proud. You coward.</font>

449
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,420
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully to me.</font>

450
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,090
<font color="yellow">People can lie,</font>

451
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,250
<font color="yellow">but the body cannot.</font>

452
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I mean?</font>

453
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,250
<font color="yellow">Is this a test?</font>

454
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,690
<font color="yellow">Try to solve the problem.</font>

455
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,690
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

456
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,290
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

457
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,790
<font color="yellow">Who hits you?</font>

458
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
<font color="yellow">Is it your mum?</font>

459
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,090
<font color="yellow">Or your dad?</font>

460
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,950
<font color="yellow">No. It isn't true.</font>

461
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,190
<font color="yellow">This is what you say in this situation.</font>

462
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,390
<font color="yellow">Remember.</font>

463
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,550
<font color="yellow">People's lips lie...</font>

464
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,820
<font color="yellow">from time to time.</font>

465
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,420
<font color="yellow">What am I going to say next?</font>

466
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,950
<font color="yellow">See? A person's body cannot lie.</font>

467
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,950
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I mean?</font>

468
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,850
<font color="yellow">If you don't understand it, memorise it.</font>

469
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,930
<font color="yellow">If you become a doctor later,</font>

470
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,850
<font color="yellow">it will be very useful.</font>

471
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,090
<font color="yellow">Okay. People lie, but...</font>

472
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,950
<font color="yellow">The body cannot lie.</font>

473
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,420
<font color="yellow">Bingo. Correct. Good job.</font>

474
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,140
<font color="yellow">I wonder if you can...</font>

475
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,720
<font color="yellow">answer this correctly.</font>

476
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,020
<font color="yellow">Will you try it? Will you?</font>

477
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,150
<font color="yellow">- I'll try it.
-  Good.</font>

478
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

479
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,990
<font color="yellow">Who hurt you?</font>

480
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you know.</font>

481
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,850
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

482
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,950
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Tell me.</font>

483
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,850
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

484
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,490
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to him?</font>

485
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,520
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

486
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

487
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,550
<font color="yellow">We need to speak.</font>

488
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,050
<font color="yellow">I will file a formal complaint with the hospital.</font>

489
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,980
<font color="yellow">You sneaked into his room when his guardian was out.</font>

490
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,520
<font color="yellow">No child could admit...</font>

491
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,100
<font color="yellow">he is being abused...</font>

492
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,420
<font color="yellow">in front of his mum.</font>

493
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

494
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,320
<font color="yellow">are you saying I beat my child?</font>

495
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,820
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

496
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,690
<font color="yellow">Do I look that despicable or something?</font>

497
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,750
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in you, Ma'am.</font>

498
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,720
<font color="yellow">What I care about...</font>

499
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,070
<font color="yellow">is that my post-op patient...</font>

500
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,240
<font color="yellow">needs to be protected.</font>

501
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,520
<font color="yellow">A guardian must protect my patient...</font>

502
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,850
<font color="yellow">from any impact and infections.</font>

503
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,990
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious if that guardian...</font>

504
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,420
<font color="yellow">will be that child's mum...</font>

505
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,650
<font color="yellow">or his dad.</font>

506
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,720
<font color="yellow">I operated with my time and effort.</font>

507
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,820
<font color="yellow">I can't permit it to go to waste.</font>

508
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,390
<font color="yellow">The most dangerous person for Yo Seob...</font>

509
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,650
<font color="yellow">is none other than you.</font>

510
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,850
<font color="yellow">The kid...</font>

511
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,920
<font color="yellow">must be very cute.</font>

512
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,220
<font color="yellow">It's the first time seeing Dr Lee Young Oh...</font>

513
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,700
<font color="yellow">so interested in a patient after surgery.</font>

514
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,720
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

515
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,090
<font color="yellow">At our age,</font>

516
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,720
<font color="yellow">being cute is a survival skill.</font>

517
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,420
<font color="yellow">It isn't special.</font>

518
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,070
<font color="yellow">It's because they are too weak...</font>

519
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,950
<font color="yellow">to survive without the care of adults.</font>

520
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,890
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

521
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,690
<font color="yellow">that cuteness,</font>

522
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,090
<font color="yellow">no, more like that DNA game...</font>

523
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,890
<font color="yellow">doesn't affect me in any way.</font>

524
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,150
<font color="yellow">Why? Because I cannot feel...</font>

525
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,220
<font color="yellow">and I am a sociopath.</font>

526
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,790
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

527
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,920
<font color="yellow">Did you do it? Why?</font>

528
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,890
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

529
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,320
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Whom did you tell?</font>

530
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,520
<font color="yellow">Tell me!</font>

531
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,750
<font color="yellow">If you want to know...</font>

532
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,320
<font color="yellow">how child abuse affects the brain,</font>

533
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,990
<font color="yellow">come see me.</font>

534
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,890
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

535
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,420
<font color="yellow">how much I excel...</font>

536
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,720
<font color="yellow">in neurology.</font>

537
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,320
<font color="yellow">Then you must know this, too.</font>

538
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,870
<font color="yellow">I am incapable of controlling my impulses,</font>

539
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,550
<font color="yellow">violent nature or rage.</font>

540
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,620
<font color="yellow">Try and feel...</font>

541
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,250
<font color="yellow">how hard...</font>

542
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,350
<font color="yellow">I'm fighting back and resisting...</font>

543
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,520
<font color="yellow">the urge to do something to you.</font>

544
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,920
<font color="yellow">Just try.</font>

545
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,690
<font color="yellow">I need Wi-Fi.</font>

546
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,620
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

547
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,660
<font color="yellow">That Wi-Fi just turns on whenever it feels like.</font>

548
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,420
<font color="yellow">I should ask to be transferred to the mountains.</font>

549
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,180
<font color="yellow">- What is 2 plus 3?
-  It's 5.</font>

550
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,650
<font color="yellow">- What's 8 times 7?
-  56.</font>

551
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,120
<font color="yellow">Okay, what is 3,427 times 21 plus 2?</font>

552
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,890
<font color="yellow">3,427...</font>

553
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,410
<font color="yellow">Can you repeat the question?</font>

554
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,790
<font color="yellow">- 71,969.
-  Wow.</font>

555
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,420
<font color="yellow">Did you do that in your head?</font>

556
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,900
<font color="yellow">You really are awesome.</font>

557
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,390
<font color="yellow">No. As I was watching you walk over,</font>

558
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,840
<font color="yellow">I counted with my hand.</font>

559
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,920
<font color="yellow">71,969.</font>

560
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,890
<font color="yellow">Okay, be prepared.</font>

561
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,490
<font color="yellow">My next question...</font>

562
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,150
<font color="yellow">is very, very difficult.</font>

563
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,950
<font color="yellow">But before that, we should eat.</font>

564
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,120
<font color="yellow">You look like...</font>

565
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,050
<font color="yellow">you desperately want glucose.</font>

566
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,960
<font color="yellow">He was definitely hit,</font>

567
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,590
<font color="yellow">but there are no signs of abuse?</font>

568
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,350
<font color="yellow">What a smart way to get away with it.</font>

569
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,190
<font color="yellow">- What is 2 plus 3?
-  Stop.</font>

570
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,490
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to answer. Don't ask me.</font>

571
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,790
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

572
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,490
<font color="yellow">that it's a logical problem you can easily solve.</font>

573
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,870
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

574
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,090
<font color="yellow">What I don't understand is...</font>

575
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,820
<font color="yellow">why the child wants to defend his mum...</font>

576
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,250
<font color="yellow">I'll just say his parent.</font>

577
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,520
<font color="yellow">Why is he defending...</font>

578
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,490
<font color="yellow">his parent who hurt him?</font>

579
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,220
<font color="yellow">What kind of emotion is that?</font>

580
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,220
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

581
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,050
<font color="yellow">It's like first love.</font>

582
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,490
<font color="yellow">Other people might not understand,</font>

583
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,820
<font color="yellow">but I'm sure they have some good memories.</font>

584
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,020
<font color="yellow">Even though the whole world says she's a bad person...</font>

585
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,390
<font color="yellow">and his head tells him she's a bad person,</font>

586
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,020
<font color="yellow">but his heart...</font>

587
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,390
<font color="yellow">must tell him otherwise.</font>

588
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,090
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to give up on the first person...</font>

589
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,550
<font color="yellow">that you've loved and trusted.</font>

590
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,120
<font color="yellow">Every parent is...</font>

591
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,520
<font color="yellow">the first person who their children meet in life.</font>

592
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,930
<font color="yellow">They're the child's first love.</font>

593
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,950
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

594
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,420
<font color="yellow">Is it that easy for normal people like you...</font>

595
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,390
<font color="yellow">to understand?</font>

596
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,650
<font color="yellow">When I was a child, I often thought that maybe,</font>

597
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,850
<font color="yellow">normal people who can feel emotions...</font>

598
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,090
<font color="yellow">are aliens from a faraway galaxy.</font>

599
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,820
<font color="yellow">I thought they had antennae that I couldn't see...</font>

600
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,190
<font color="yellow">through which they would communicate...</font>

601
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,020
<font color="yellow">with each other.</font>

602
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,420
<font color="yellow">I wondered if I couldn't understand them...</font>

603
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,590
<font color="yellow">because I was the only one from earth.</font>

604
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,350
<font color="yellow">I hear that earthlings have...</font>

605
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,690
<font color="yellow">a Wi-Fi network instead.</font>

606
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,890
<font color="yellow">That you can easily connect wherever you are.</font>

607
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,720
<font color="yellow">Wherever you are.</font>

608
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,260
<font color="yellow">I'll visit the hospital tomorrow...</font>

609
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,320
<font color="yellow">with a detective from the child abuse division.</font>

610
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,650
<font color="yellow">Let's stop worrying about the child and eat.</font>

611
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,420
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

612
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,950
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

613
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,720
<font color="yellow">that I seem to be worried about the child?</font>

614
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,290
<font color="yellow">Yes. You seem really worried.</font>

615
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,650
<font color="yellow">We're here to see Choi Yo Seob and his guardian.</font>

616
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,620
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem with the hospital?</font>

617
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,350
<font color="yellow">No, we got a report of child abuse.</font>

618
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
<font color="yellow">Child abuse?</font>

619
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,420
<font color="yellow">Patient Choi Yo Seob?</font>

620
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,450
<font color="yellow">If you call that abuse, my mum should be in prison.</font>

621
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,850
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh was sure that he'd been abused.</font>

622
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,200
<font color="yellow">We presume that the child...</font>

623
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,090
<font color="yellow">was abused for a prolonged period of time.</font>

624
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

625
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,790
<font color="yellow">I'll show you the way.</font>

626
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,150
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

627
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,260
<font color="yellow">This way, please.</font>

628
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,050
<font color="yellow">Yo Seob, I...</font>

629
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,990
<font color="yellow">The patient is not here.</font>

630
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,020
<font color="yellow">Has he been discharged?</font>

631
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
<font color="yellow">Dead.</font>

632
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,050
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
-  I mean...</font>

633
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,790
<font color="yellow">I'm dead. Dr Lee Young Oh will kill me...</font>

634
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,650
<font color="yellow">for the negligence of patient care.</font>

635
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,350
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee could stay quiet for a while...</font>

636
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,220
<font color="yellow">and then strangle me with his stethoscope like this.</font>

637
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,540
<font color="yellow">What should I do? I have to find him.</font>

638
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,720
<font color="yellow">Where did he go...</font>

639
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,150
<font color="yellow">- I'm in trouble.
-  Excuse me.</font>

640
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,920
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  Wait.</font>

641
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how important the immersion classes are?</font>

642
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,280
<font color="yellow">Do I have really have to go? I'm still in pain.</font>

643
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,590
<font color="yellow">You can't survive in this world with such a weak mind.</font>

644
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,660
<font color="yellow">Think of your dad. He's strong.</font>

645
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,390
<font color="yellow">You're his son. You should be like him.</font>

646
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,050
<font color="yellow">My head hurts.</font>

647
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:23,290
<font color="yellow">Stop being such a crybaby. It gives me a headache.</font>

648
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,170
<font color="yellow">Your dad and I are doing our best.</font>

649
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,890
<font color="yellow">We spend so much time and money on you.</font>

650
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,390
<font color="yellow">We're doing the best to make your life perfect.</font>

651
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,120
<font color="yellow">Choi Yo Seob, can't you just keep up with us?</font>

652
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,520
<font color="yellow">Stop biting your nails!</font>

653
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,140
<font color="yellow">How many times did I tell you?</font>

654
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,020
<font color="yellow">Quit doing that already!</font>

655
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,760
<font color="yellow">Mum...</font>

656
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,260
<font color="yellow">Did you just pee yourself?</font>

657
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,290
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

658
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,120
<font color="yellow">Don't touch him.</font>

659
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,970
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of me.</font>

660
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,090
<font color="yellow">I said, let go!</font>

661
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,720
<font color="yellow">- Stop it!
-  Let go of me!</font>

662
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,450
<font color="yellow">Don't touch my patient.</font>

663
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

664
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,490
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

665
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,760
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

666
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,990
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do to my wife?</font>

667
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,520
<font color="yellow">Dad...</font>

668
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,890
<font color="yellow">Wait. Ma'am, where is Yo Seob?</font>

669
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,020
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

670
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,420
<font color="yellow">What happened to her?</font>

671
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,840
<font color="yellow">She's lost consciousness.</font>

672
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,390
<font color="yellow">Get an MRI,</font>

673
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,330
<font color="yellow">and call Neurology.</font>

674
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,650
<font color="yellow">Don't listen to him.</font>

675
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, wow. You're him, right?</font>

676
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,930
<font color="yellow">He's Anchor Choi Sang Hyuk from "News Briefing".</font>

677
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,690
<font color="yellow">I'm the guardian of this patient.</font>

678
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,810
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang.</font>

679
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,140
<font color="yellow">I can't let a person like him treat my wife.</font>

680
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,920
<font color="yellow">Please find me another doctor.</font>

681
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,350
<font color="yellow">Sure. I will.</font>

682
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,650
<font color="yellow">This patient is suffering from a brain tumour.</font>

683
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,760
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you hurry? Go now!</font>

684
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

685
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,520
<font color="yellow">My wife was just fine.</font>

686
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,900
<font color="yellow">You caused this.</font>

687
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,220
<font color="yellow">I saw what happened with my own eyes.</font>

688
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,850
<font color="yellow">You assaulted a patient's guardian.</font>

689
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,420
<font color="yellow">I'll make you pay for it.</font>

690
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,950
<font color="yellow">Your wife has a brain tumour.</font>

691
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,490
<font color="yellow">And there's a problem in the right frontal lobe.</font>

692
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,420
<font color="yellow">Her personality changed suddenly.</font>

693
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,450
<font color="yellow">Her right eyebrow was raised.</font>

694
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,590
<font color="yellow">Her left arm and leg jerked.</font>

695
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,190
<font color="yellow">She also has intermittent urinary problems.</font>

696
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,890
<font color="yellow">These are the symptoms...</font>

697
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,020
<font color="yellow">of brain tumour in the right frontal lobe.</font>

698
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,420
<font color="yellow">What confirms her disease is...</font>

699
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,650
<font color="yellow">the fact that she's been abusing your son...</font>

700
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,650
<font color="yellow">for the past six months.</font>

701
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,490
<font color="yellow">Do you need more proof?</font>

702
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,020
<font color="yellow">It turns out that his dad is Anchor Choi Sang Hyuk.</font>

703
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,870
<font color="yellow">I think he looks better in person.</font>

704
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,230
<font color="yellow">He was exuding his charisma.</font>

705
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,150
<font color="yellow">All dads are useless.</font>

706
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,030
<font color="yellow">What's the point of pursuing justice?</font>

707
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,150
<font color="yellow">He didn't even know that his son was being abused.</font>

708
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,090
<font color="yellow">That's the sorrow of fathers' lives.</font>

709
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,310
<font color="yellow">He's been too busy working to support his family...</font>

710
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,150
<font color="yellow">to see what happens in his family. I feel bad for him.</font>

711
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,850
<font color="yellow">I hear that his wife has a brain tumour.</font>

712
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
<font color="yellow">Is that why she abused her son?</font>

713
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,120
<font color="yellow">That's just Dr Lee's opinion.</font>

714
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,590
<font color="yellow">We'll know when the test result comes out.</font>

715
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,420
<font color="yellow">I don't want to defend Dr Lee,</font>

716
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,460
<font color="yellow">but his assumption makes sense.</font>

717
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,120
<font color="yellow">If you have a problem in the frontal lobe,</font>

718
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,420
<font color="yellow">your...</font>

719
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,520
<font color="yellow">personality can change completely...</font>

720
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,130
<font color="yellow">and you can become violent.</font>

721
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,450
<font color="yellow">It's possible that she abused her son because of that.</font>

722
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,220
<font color="yellow">Frontal lobe diseases are...</font>

723
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,070
<font color="yellow">really scary.</font>

724
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,620
<font color="yellow">Hang on a second.</font>

725
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
<font color="yellow">Is it possible...</font>

726
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,060
<font color="yellow">that Dr Lee has a frontal lobe disease?</font>

727
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,780
<font color="yellow">Think about it. He lacks empathy.</font>

728
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,260
<font color="yellow">He can't understand others' feelings.</font>

729
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,090
<font color="yellow">He can't sympathise with others. Right?</font>

730
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,300
<font color="yellow">You can just describe him with one word.</font>

731
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,260
<font color="yellow">He's a psychopath.</font>

732
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,390
<font color="yellow">That's probably why.</font>

733
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,920
<font color="yellow">Think about what happened to the child's mother.</font>

734
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,920
<font color="yellow">We can't be sure if it was because of...</font>

735
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,790
<font color="yellow">her brain tumour or if Dr Lee assaulted her.</font>

736
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,220
<font color="yellow">It's possible because it's Dr Lee.</font>

737
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,650
<font color="yellow">(Anchor Choi Sang Hyuk abuses his child.)</font>

738
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,190
<font color="yellow">That's possible.</font>

739
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,520
<font color="yellow">So you want me to forge...</font>

740
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,790
<font color="yellow">your son's medical records.</font>

741
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,950
<font color="yellow">It's the request of Anchor Choi Sang Hyuk.</font>

742
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,790
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

743
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,820
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you to correct it.</font>

744
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,990
<font color="yellow">You're being discourteous.</font>

745
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,050
<font color="yellow">I work out at 4pm every day.</font>

746
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,520
<font color="yellow">It's a strict rule I've been keeping...</font>

747
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,590
<font color="yellow">for the past 10 years.</font>

748
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,950
<font color="yellow">Even...</font>

749
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,190
<font color="yellow">the great Choi Sang Hyuk...</font>

750
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,220
<font color="yellow">can't make me break that rule.</font>

751
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,520
<font color="yellow">I like doing business like this.</font>

752
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,190
<font color="yellow">We give and take from each other.</font>

753
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,290
<font color="yellow">I gave you something yesterday.</font>

754
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,650
<font color="yellow">Today, you'll give me something in return.</font>

755
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,550
<font color="yellow">Shall we...</font>

756
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,850
<font color="yellow">start talking about business?</font>

757
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,050
<font color="yellow">Let's see who will benefit more.</font>

758
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,570
<font color="yellow">Every family has a story.</font>

759
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,920
<font color="yellow">He has no right to do this.</font>

760
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,790
<font color="yellow">He stigmatised me and my wife for child abuse...</font>

761
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,020
<font color="yellow">just because he is my son's doctor.</font>

762
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,220
<font color="yellow">Who is your son's doctor?</font>

763
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,080
<font color="yellow">He's Dr Lee Young Oh from Neurosurgery.</font>

764
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,090
<font color="yellow">Lee Young Oh...</font>

765
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,190
<font color="yellow">It's hard even for us to deal with Dr Lee.</font>

766
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,020
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll have to deal with him myself...</font>

767
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,290
<font color="yellow">using the power of media.</font>

768
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,960
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

769
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,350
<font color="yellow">that Dr Lee is a psychopathic surgeon.</font>

770
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,490
<font color="yellow">Earlier today, he assaulted a patient's guardian...</font>

771
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,990
<font color="yellow">in the parking lot.</font>

772
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,090
<font color="yellow">I've already secured the security camera footage.</font>

773
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,290
<font color="yellow">However, the hospital is...</font>

774
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,400
<font color="yellow">trying to cover up the incident...</font>

775
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,590
<font color="yellow">by accusing the patient's parents of child abuse.</font>

776
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,090
<font color="yellow">That's the story I'll tell the media.</font>

777
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,920
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll be okay?</font>

778
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,190
<font color="yellow">I'm not worried it might damage my reputation.</font>

779
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,690
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I might lose the power of my words.</font>

780
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,420
<font color="yellow">If that happens,</font>

781
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,590
<font color="yellow">who will convince the public...</font>

782
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,790
<font color="yellow">about the regenerative medicine research at Hyunsung?</font>

841
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,850

846
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,250

-  Is my mum...</font>

849
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,220
<font color="yellow">very sick, Doctor?</font>

850
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,250
<font color="yellow">Come on in and sit down.</font>

851
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,520
<font color="yellow">Sit here.</font>

852
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,720
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

853
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,490
<font color="yellow">Is that why you wanted to become a doctor?</font>

854
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,950
<font color="yellow">You wanted to cure your mum's disease?</font>

855
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,160
<font color="yellow">This is just between you and me.</font>

856
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,670
<font color="yellow">Since you want to become a doctor,</font>

857
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,250
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you a secret that I haven't told to anyone.</font>

858
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,020
<font color="yellow">It's the thing about being sick.</font>

859
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,520
<font color="yellow">It makes your true self disappear.</font>

860
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,850
<font color="yellow">A healthy person can become skinny.</font>

861
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,220
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, people's appearances change.</font>

862
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,950
<font color="yellow">That's what happened to your mum.</font>

863
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,320
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

864
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,390
<font color="yellow">please change her back.</font>

865
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,750
<font color="yellow">Make her just the way she used to be.</font>

866
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,490
<font color="yellow">I don't trust you.</font>

867
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,850
<font color="yellow">You were afraid of the surgery,</font>

868
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,190
<font color="yellow">but your weren't...</font>

869
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,220
<font color="yellow">afraid of your mum.</font>

870
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,250
<font color="yellow">Or were you?</font>

871
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,650
<font color="yellow">It was bearable.</font>

872
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,650
<font color="yellow">You should have told someone.</font>

873
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,550
<font color="yellow">At least to your dad.</font>

874
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,850
<font color="yellow">I thought that if my dad hates my mum,</font>

875
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,550
<font color="yellow">I could lose her.</font>

876
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,920
<font color="yellow">Then, I'd be left alone.</font>

877
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,450
<font color="yellow">People in the hospital...</font>

878
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,790
<font color="yellow">think you've disappeared.</font>

879
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,890
<font color="yellow">Appear in front of them...</font>

880
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,850
<font color="yellow">and surprise them.</font>

881
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,620
<font color="yellow">I just told you to go.</font>

882
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,650
<font color="yellow">I forgot...</font>

883
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,390
<font color="yellow">the way to my room.</font>

884
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,250
<font color="yellow">You forgot...</font>

885
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,390
<font color="yellow">the way to your room?</font>

886
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,390
<font color="yellow">Doctor,</font>

887
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,120
<font color="yellow">what was it?</font>

888
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,050
<font color="yellow">The test I took.</font>

889
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,390
<font color="yellow">The thing about the lie...</font>

890
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,450
<font color="yellow">You said that people can lie...</font>

891
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,350
<font color="yellow">Our bodies can't lie.</font>

892
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,350
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh is the only one who can do this.</font>

893
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,720
<font color="yellow">There's a large meningioma...</font>

894
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,690
<font color="yellow">here in the right frontal lobe.</font>

895
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,590
<font color="yellow">Honey, I heard that I did it because I was sick.</font>

896
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,240
<font color="yellow">It was the disease that made me to the things...</font>

897
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,920
<font color="yellow">to our son.</font>

898
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,570
<font color="yellow">It was because I was sick.</font>

899
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,450
<font color="yellow">If Dr Lee performs this surgery,</font>

900
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,590
<font color="yellow">he'll remove the tumour safely.</font>

901
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,720
<font color="yellow">It might take some time,</font>

902
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,450
<font color="yellow">but you could regain your original personality.</font>

903
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:54,220
<font color="yellow">If Dr Lee is the only option in this hospital,</font>

904
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,430
<font color="yellow">I'll transfer her to another hospital.</font>

905
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,490
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

906
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,790
<font color="yellow">It's a very dangerous surgery.</font>

907
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,990
<font color="yellow">If the surgeon is not as good as Dr Lee,</font>

908
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,000
<font color="yellow">your wife's life...</font>

909
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,320
<font color="yellow">could be in danger during the surgery.</font>

910
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,850
<font color="yellow">If you continue to insist Dr Lee as our surgeon,</font>

911
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,420
<font color="yellow">then we have no choice.</font>

912
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,550
<font color="yellow">We'll be leaving this hospital.</font>

913
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,490
<font color="yellow">The reason behind your abusive behaviour...</font>

914
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,350
<font color="yellow">isn't what's relevant.</font>

915
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,390
<font color="yellow">The issue is that you're my wife.</font>

916
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,650
<font color="yellow">Whether you're actually ill or not,</font>

917
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,950
<font color="yellow">don't ever admit...</font>

918
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,720
<font color="yellow">to abusing our son.</font>

919
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,320
<font color="yellow">Get your head on straight.</font>

920
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,520
<font color="yellow">Choi Sang Hyuk speaking.</font>

921
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,490
<font color="yellow">When your son was admitted,</font>

922
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,150
<font color="yellow">I implicated you...</font>

923
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,350
<font color="yellow">as an abusive parent.</font>

924
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,840
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

925
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,950
<font color="yellow">The symptoms of physical abuse were clear,</font>

926
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,520
<font color="yellow">but there were no bruises present.</font>

927
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:21,190
<font color="yellow">Being a news anchor,</font>

928
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,390
<font color="yellow">I figured...</font>

929
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,590
<font color="yellow">that you could be completely discreet.</font>

930
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,150
<font color="yellow">But the real culprit was...</font>

931
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,050
<font color="yellow">your son.</font>

932
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,930
<font color="yellow">Bumpy and glamorous.</font>

933
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,650
<font color="yellow">He sang under the comforter alone...</font>

934
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,790
<font color="yellow">to endure the pain.</font>

935
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,250
<font color="yellow">The comforter dampened his external injuries.</font>

936
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,490
<font color="yellow">Tomato.</font>

937
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,090
<font color="yellow">Your son was afraid...</font>

938
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,950
<font color="yellow">that exposing the truth...</font>

939
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,050
<font color="yellow">would isolate him.</font>

940
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,620
<font color="yellow">Hence, he couldn't tell anyone.</font>

941
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,020
<font color="yellow">While the poor child...</font>

942
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,620
<font color="yellow">struggled to protect...</font>

943
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,150
<font color="yellow">his mother and his family,</font>

944
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,450
<font color="yellow">where were you?</font>

945
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,090
<font color="yellow">Admit to your domestic neglect.</font>

946
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,450
<font color="yellow">Your wife abused your child,</font>

947
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
<font color="yellow">and you...</font>

948
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,950
<font color="yellow">neglected your family.</font>

949
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:35,850
<font color="yellow">He'll need continued treatments after the operation.</font>

950
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,490
<font color="yellow">If your son's trauma is left untreated,</font>

951
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,020
<font color="yellow">his frontal lobe will develop complications.</font>

952
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,150
<font color="yellow">He'll be rendered unable to discern others' emotions.</font>

953
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,190
<font color="yellow">- That's...
-  That means...</font>

954
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,850
<font color="yellow">his fear will come to fruition.</font>

955
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,050
<font color="yellow">He'll become isolated.</font>

956
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,450
<font color="yellow">He'll become like me.</font>

957
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,950
<font color="yellow">Please proceed with the operation.</font>

958
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,150
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee,</font>

959
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,420
<font color="yellow">please help me.</font>

960
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,290
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

961
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,120
<font color="yellow">Let's get divorced after the operation.</font>

962
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,210
<font color="yellow">You'll have to consent to the operation beforehand.</font>

963
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,070
<font color="yellow">Divorce? Who are you to decide?</font>

964
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,220
<font color="yellow">You said so yourself.</font>

965
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,220
<font color="yellow">My illness or our son's abuse is not your concern.</font>

966
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,790
<font color="yellow">Your problem is that I'm your wife.</font>

967
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,120
<font color="yellow">I'll be receiving the surgery.</font>

968
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,720
<font color="yellow">It wasn't on purpose,</font>

969
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,590
<font color="yellow">but I admit to abusing our son.</font>

970
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,120
<font color="yellow">I'm going to receive therapy as well.</font>

971

973
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,820
<font color="yellow">Doctor, I have a favour to ask.</font>

974
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,150
<font color="yellow">When you remove my tumour,</font>

975
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:07,550
<font color="yellow">please remove...</font>

976
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,450
<font color="yellow">the memories...</font>

977
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,790
<font color="yellow">of how I caused Yo Seob to suffer...</font>

978
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:15,850
<font color="yellow">along with it.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Surgeon: Dr Lee Young Oh)</font>

980
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,120
<font color="yellow">(Surgery is complete.)</font>

981
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,120
<font color="yellow">Did you really perform the surgery...</font>

982
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,550
<font color="yellow">against Chairman Kang's will?</font>

983
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,320
<font color="yellow">The meningioma patient abused her son?</font>

984
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,490
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

985
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,650
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

986
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,450
<font color="yellow">No matter the circumstances,</font>

987
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,750
<font color="yellow">doctors must never give up on their patients first.</font>

988
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,350
<font color="yellow">What you said...</font>

989
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,120
<font color="yellow">was right.</font>

990
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,150
<font color="yellow">Doctors need to empathise with their patients.</font>

991
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,240
<font color="yellow">I was able to operate on the meningioma patient...</font>

992
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,990
<font color="yellow">not because of my skills as a surgeon,</font>

993
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,190
<font color="yellow">but because...</font>

994
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,850
<font color="yellow">I had empathy for the child.</font>

995
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,650
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

996
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,290
<font color="yellow">Lee Young Oh,</font>

997
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,490

00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,950
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

999
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,220
<font color="yellow">really had empathy for the patient?</font>

1000
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,450
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

1001
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,950
<font color="yellow">His experience wasn't foreign to me.</font>

1002
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,250
<font color="yellow">That child...</font>

1003
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:13,890
<font color="yellow">was just like me...</font>

1004
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,790
<font color="yellow">during my childhood.</font>

1005
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,290
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious...</font>

1006
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,150
<font color="yellow">about the past...</font>

1007
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,920
<font color="yellow">of those two men?</font>

1008
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,590
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

1009
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,820
<font color="yellow">I will be a good mother to Yo Seob from now on.</font>

1010
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,650
<font color="yellow">I'll make time...</font>

1011
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,450
<font color="yellow">for you, Dr Lee.</font>

1012
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,450
<font color="yellow">Let's go grab a drink someday.</font>

1013
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,490
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

1014
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,750
<font color="yellow">don't enjoy drinking alcohol.</font>

1015
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,890
<font color="yellow">However, I understand your gesture of goodwill.</font>

1016
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,250
<font color="yellow">You never impeded on your rule for 10 years.</font>

1017
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,220
<font color="yellow">That indicates...</font>

1018
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,520
<font color="yellow">that I've become a special individual to you.</font>

1019
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,720
<font color="yellow">Let's say goodbye and get going.</font>

1020
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,690
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

1021
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,820
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

1022
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:14,390
<font color="yellow">I won't forget you.</font>

1023
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,250
<font color="yellow">I'll become a good doctor like you no matter what.</font>

1024
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,750
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

1025
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,290
<font color="yellow">Don't remember me.</font>

1026
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,520
<font color="yellow">The time you spent here with me.</font>

1027
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:34,690
<font color="yellow">Forget it all.</font>

1028
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,850
<font color="yellow">Let's say that such events...</font>

1029
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,290
<font color="yellow">never happened.</font>

1030
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,020
<font color="yellow">Live free.</font>

1031
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,450
<font color="yellow">Live energetically.</font>

1032
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,590
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

1033
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,850
<font color="yellow">Now's the time.</font>

1034
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,820
<font color="yellow">I need...</font>

1035
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,720
<font color="yellow">Wi-Fi.</font>

1036
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:50,990
<font color="yellow">Can you believe it?</font>

1037
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,020
<font color="yellow">He didn't say a word.</font>

1038
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:54,920
<font color="yellow">There were no body signals.</font>

1039
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,550
<font color="yellow">Yet, I knew...</font>

1040
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,220
<font color="yellow">what that child was thinking.</font>

1041
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,290
<font color="yellow">Can you believe it?</font>

1042
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,450
<font color="yellow">- Are you listening to me?
-  Yes.</font>

1043
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,410
<font color="yellow">Are you really listening to me?</font>

1044
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,650
<font color="yellow">Gosh, be careful!</font>

1045
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,690
<font color="yellow">You... You didn't feel anything, did you?</font>

1046
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,150
<font color="yellow">Same here.</font>

1047
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,820
<font color="yellow">Let... Let me throw this ball back.</font>

1048
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,990
<font color="yellow">What is this feeling?</font>

1049
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,090
<font color="yellow">I want to make an effort.</font>

1050
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,690
<font color="yellow">It may be impossible.</font>

1051
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,720
<font color="yellow">But for once,</font>

1052
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,490
<font color="yellow">I'd like to make an effort.</font>

1053
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:01,990
<font color="yellow">Love...</font>

1054
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,220
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, your training may be over now.</font>

1055
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,590
<font color="yellow">Did you finally begin...</font>

1056
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,450
<font color="yellow">to love your patient?</font>

1057
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,420
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

1058
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1059
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,290
<font color="yellow">It's you.</font>
