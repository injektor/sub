00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,490
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang, call Obstetrics.</font>

163
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,580
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

164
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,710
<font color="yellow">No! I can't.</font>

165
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,910
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

166
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,380
<font color="yellow">This baby...</font>

167
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,810
<font color="yellow">isn't mine.</font>

168
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,910
<font color="yellow">It isn't my baby.</font>

169
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,980
<font color="yellow">We notified Obstetrics.</font>

170
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,940
<font color="yellow">The doctor is heading to the ER.</font>

171
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,910
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

172
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
<font color="yellow">I got it. Okay.</font>

173
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,480
<font color="yellow">I'm losing my mind.</font>

174
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,410
<font color="yellow">Stand up straight!</font>

175
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,050
<font color="yellow">Punk.</font>

176
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,240
<font color="yellow">You really became a doctor.</font>

177
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,360
<font color="yellow">You used to skip classes when you were young...</font>

178
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,810
<font color="yellow">thanks to your parents' influence.</font>

179
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,410
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

180
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

181
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,940
<font color="yellow">Samgwang Middle School.</font>

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,880
<font color="yellow">It's me, Han Mo. Jung Han Mo.</font>

183
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,610
<font color="yellow">Han Mo. Jung Han Mo?</font>

184
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,650
<font color="yellow">Han Mo?</font>

185
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,310
<font color="yellow">Why have you changed so much?</font>

186
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,350
<font color="yellow">I didn't recognise you.</font>

187
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,010
<font color="yellow">- How have you been?
-  Good.</font>

188
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,940
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

189
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,540
<font color="yellow">Every time I got new basketball sneakers,</font>

190
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,340
<font color="yellow">you used to take them from me. Do you want to die?</font>

191
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,510
<font color="yellow">It's thanks to my taking your sneakers...</font>

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,440
<font color="yellow">that you didn't play basketball and became a doctor.</font>

193
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,710
<font color="yellow">I'm so proud of you.</font>

194
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,050
<font color="yellow">You're right. Thanks.</font>

195
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,980
<font color="yellow">Do you want a taste of my drop kick?</font>

196
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,780
<font color="yellow">Stop overreacting.</font>

197
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,710
<font color="yellow">Stop that. I'm tired.</font>

198
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,410
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

199
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,310
<font color="yellow">It hurts.</font>

200
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
<font color="yellow">Han Mo.</font>

201
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,310
<font color="yellow">Han Mo. Hey. Hey!</font>

202
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,810
<font color="yellow">Han Mo. Han Mo!</font>

203
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,990
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

204
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,010
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

205
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,150
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened.</font>

206
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,800
<font color="yellow">I need to close this up.</font>

207
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,510
<font color="yellow">- Bring me the kit.
-  Okay.</font>

208
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
<font color="yellow">Careful.</font>

209
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,680
<font color="yellow">- Hurry.
-  Hey, you!</font>

210
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,810
<font color="yellow">What? What?</font>

211
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,580
<font color="yellow">You seem like a real doctor.</font>

212
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,640
<font color="yellow">This isn't a joke.</font>

213
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,480
<font color="yellow">A surrogate? Do you mean...</font>

214
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,240
<font color="yellow">you lent your womb?</font>

215
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

216
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,580
<font color="yellow">Did you know about this?</font>

217
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,210
<font color="yellow">It's good for both parties...</font>

218
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,580
<font color="yellow">who are in need.</font>

219
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,810
<font color="yellow">She introduced me to the parents of the baby.</font>

220
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,180
<font color="yellow">She takes care of me.</font>

221
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,810
<font color="yellow">Shin Joo.</font>

222
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,070
<font color="yellow">Be strong...</font>

223
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,380
<font color="yellow">and tough it out for one week.</font>

224
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,480
<font color="yellow">There's a difference between...</font>

225
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
<font color="yellow">a 29-week premature baby...</font>

226
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,910
<font color="yellow">and an impatient 30-week baby that came early.</font>

227
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,180
<font color="yellow">Which do you think would be better?</font>

228
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,310
<font color="yellow">I'll try.</font>

229
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,610
<font color="yellow">I'll do all I can.</font>

230
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,480
<font color="yellow">Please talk to the parents for me.</font>

231
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,910
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

232
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,640
<font color="yellow">I won't give birth.</font>

233
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,430
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

234
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,440
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

235
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,370
<font color="yellow">This is no time to think about 29 weeks...</font>

236
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,580
<font color="yellow">or 30 weeks...</font>

237
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,210
<font color="yellow">and let your delusions take control.</font>

238
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,040
<font color="yellow">Your brain already started to bleed.</font>

239
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,080
<font color="yellow">Nobody can predict...</font>

240
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,580
<font color="yellow">what will happen.</font>

241
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,760
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

242
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,540
<font color="yellow">the baby in your womb...</font>

243
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,980
<font color="yellow">may not even see...</font>

244
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,440
<font color="yellow">the inside of an incubator,</font>

245
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,310
<font color="yellow">which you people detest so much,</font>

246
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,810
<font color="yellow">and die...</font>

247
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,440
<font color="yellow">from lack of oxygen.</font>

248
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,540
<font color="yellow">If you don't get surgery now,</font>

249
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,040
<font color="yellow">it may die. Do you understand me?</font>

250
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,180
<font color="yellow">It may die.</font>

251
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,310
<font color="yellow">If I have it now,</font>

252
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,680
<font color="yellow">my children and I...</font>

253
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,140
<font color="yellow">will die.</font>

254
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,080
<font color="yellow">This baby's parents...</font>

255
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,940
<font color="yellow">are paying our rent...</font>

256
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,310
<font color="yellow">and living expenses...</font>

257
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,180
<font color="yellow">in exchange for a healthy baby.</font>

258
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,110
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me like that.</font>

259
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,410
<font color="yellow">I am helping people in need.</font>

260
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,240
<font color="yellow">I can't have the baby now.</font>

261
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,740
<font color="yellow">Not for my children's sake.</font>

262
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
<font color="yellow">Decide.</font>

263
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,810
<font color="yellow">This was your decision.</font>

264
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,240
<font color="yellow">Okay. Answer me.</font>

265
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,530
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

266
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,780
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

267
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,540
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

268
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,610
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

269
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,810
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

270
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,380
<font color="yellow">asking her to decide...</font>

271
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,640
<font color="yellow">or trying to scare her?</font>

272
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,790
<font color="yellow">You push and...</font>

273
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,910
<font color="yellow">demand an answer and a decision.</font>

274
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,790
<font color="yellow">You should be understanding of her situation first.</font>

275
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,110
<font color="yellow">You should give her time to think, too.</font>

276
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,780
<font color="yellow">It's so obvious.</font>

277
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,570
<font color="yellow">This is how you treat your girlfriends, isn't it?</font>

278
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,780
<font color="yellow">I gave her time.</font>

279
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,810
<font color="yellow">Plenty of time...</font>

280
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,040
<font color="yellow">to reflect and think.</font>

281
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,740
<font color="yellow">To whom?</font>

282
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,810
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang.</font>

283
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,510
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

284
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,980
<font color="yellow">take on that patient?</font>

285
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,940
<font color="yellow">The baby's heart will struggle to last two days.</font>

286
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,240
<font color="yellow">If you're so confident, get her to consent to surgery.</font>

287
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

288
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,940
<font color="yellow">While understanding her situation...</font>

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,880
<font color="yellow">and giving her plenty of time.</font>

290
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,510
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

291
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,910
<font color="yellow">(Wi-Fi)</font>

292
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,520
<font color="yellow">Wi-Fi?</font>

293
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,300
<font color="yellow">Wi-Fi? Why?</font>

294
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,200
<font color="yellow">Did you hate seeing your unemployed brother...</font>

295
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,140
<font color="yellow">- play games to cut...?
-  That's not it.</font>

296
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,880
<font color="yellow">That's not it. I said it isn't.</font>

297

<font color="yellow">If you annoy me again, I'll cut off your Wi-Fi. Got it?</font>

298
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,750

<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

301
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,680
<font color="yellow">Let me make myself clear.</font>

302
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,310
<font color="yellow">I will not accept an answer like this...</font>

303
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,110
<font color="yellow">that is not at a designated time and place.</font>

304

<font color="yellow">I won't accept a notification.</font>

305
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,440
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

306
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,480
<font color="yellow">Are you angry right now?</font>

307
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am angry right now.</font>

308
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,680
<font color="yellow">It is all your fault.</font>

309
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,580
<font color="yellow">Seeing a foolish patient make a bad decision...</font>

310
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,880
<font color="yellow">annoyed and frustrated me.</font>

311
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,110
<font color="yellow">I've never felt this way before.</font>

312
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,010
<font color="yellow">And I've been saying stupid things.</font>

313
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,910
<font color="yellow">When I think about you,</font>

314
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,710
<font color="yellow">I say stupid things.</font>

315
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,620
<font color="yellow">Ever since you jumped in the water,</font>

316
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,980
<font color="yellow">I've been a total...</font>

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,310
<font color="yellow">But what's more shocking is...</font>

318
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,810
<font color="yellow">that I don't hate...</font>

<font color="yellow">I heard Ms Kang Shin Joo is your patient.</font>

321
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,280
<font color="yellow">Neurology was notified that she's getting steroids.</font>

322
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,640
<font color="yellow">Is she in emergency surgery right now?</font>

323
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,310
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

324
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,410
<font color="yellow">You may hate me.</font>

325
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,280
<font color="yellow">But this isn't about me.</font>

326
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,680
<font color="yellow">We've decided...</font>

327
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,810
<font color="yellow">to operate,</font>

328
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,180
<font color="yellow">if the patient decides to.</font>

329
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,480
<font color="yellow">If the patient decides to?</font>

330
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,780
<font color="yellow">You're waiting?</font>

331
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,680
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting...</font>

332
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,280
<font color="yellow">for Ms Jang to convince her.</font>

333
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,940
<font color="yellow">The patient is deciding on a surgery...</font>

334
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,010
<font color="yellow">and you asked a nurse for help?</font>

335
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,980
<font color="yellow">For your surgery?</font>

336
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,940
<font color="yellow">Who made you this way?</font>

337
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
<font color="yellow">You've...</font>

338
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,210
<font color="yellow">changed.</font>

339
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,110
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

340
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,380
<font color="yellow">Why don't we take an MRI or a PET...</font>

341
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,080
<font color="yellow">of your brain?</font>

342
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
<font color="yellow">Are you still...</font>

343
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
<font color="yellow">playing my doctor?</font>

344
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,580
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim.</font>

345
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
<font color="yellow">Come any time...</font>

346
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,580
<font color="yellow">if you still need me.</font>

347
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,540
<font color="yellow">You're back early.</font>

348
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,710
<font color="yellow">Weren't you at Hyunsung Group's performance meeting?</font>

349
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,680
<font color="yellow">They attacked me like crazy...</font>

350
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,010
<font color="yellow">because we're the least profitable in the group.</font>

351
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,680
<font color="yellow">I don't need to stay and applaud like an idiot...</font>

352
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,910
<font color="yellow">every time the others present their profits.</font>

353
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,310
<font color="yellow">Once the regenerative medicine enters the market,</font>

354
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,610
<font color="yellow">the group's attitude will change.</font>

355
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,540
<font color="yellow">It changed already.</font>

356
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,040
<font color="yellow">My brother is already on guard.</font>

357
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,910
<font color="yellow">He appreciates how big the market is.</font>

358
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,810
<font color="yellow">He's looking for losses in the hospital to push me out,</font>

359
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,410
<font color="yellow">so that he can claim the regenerative medicine.</font>

360
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,670
<font color="yellow">I need to bring it into the black somehow...</font>

361
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,250
<font color="yellow">before the next fiscal period.</font>

362
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,410
<font color="yellow">We don't have a method...</font>

363
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, we do.</font>

364
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,510
<font color="yellow">The fastest and most effective way.</font>

365
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,540
<font color="yellow">Downsizing.</font>

366
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,960
<font color="yellow">Manpower is only useful when you need it.</font>

367
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,080
<font color="yellow">If you don't need it...</font>

368
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,060
<font color="yellow">If it's sweet, you swallow. If it's bitter,</font>

369
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,640
<font color="yellow">you spit it out any time.</font>

370
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,050
<font color="yellow">Outsource whatever you can,</font>

371
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,780
<font color="yellow">and convert expensive, experienced workers...</font>

372
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,580
<font color="yellow">into contract workers.</font>

373
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,510
<font color="yellow">Get rid of anyone on maternity or paternity leave.</font>

374
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,750
<font color="yellow">It'll get rid of any notions of getting money for free.</font>

375
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,540
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

376
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,140
<font color="yellow">I'm 30 weeks pregnant, too.</font>

377
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,380
<font color="yellow">I'm turning 40 soon. It's so late, isn't it?</font>

378
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,240
<font color="yellow">The nurses took turns getting pregnant.</font>

379
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it.</font>

380
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,110
<font color="yellow">I don't have a job.</font>

381
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,910
<font color="yellow">I'm protecting this baby to protect my children.</font>

382
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,080
<font color="yellow">If your brain haemorrhage persists,</font>

383
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,680
<font color="yellow">your children...</font>

384
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,110
<font color="yellow">will end up as orphans.</font>

385
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,600
<font color="yellow">Even if her brain haemorrhage persists,</font>

386
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,590
<font color="yellow">the baby in her womb will be fine...</font>

387
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,740
<font color="yellow">as long as she has a respirator, right?</font>

388
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,780
<font color="yellow">It's better than an incubator.</font>

389
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,040
<font color="yellow">The parents of the baby would prefer...</font>

390
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

391
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,780
<font color="yellow">Be realistic.</font>

392
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,080
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be out on the streets?</font>

393
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,810
<font color="yellow">It's a hospital. They'll keep you alive.</font>

394
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,990
<font color="yellow">Tough it out for one week.</font>

395
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,580
<font color="yellow">No. Just 3 to 4 days. You have to.</font>

396
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,710
<font color="yellow">Mr Nam.</font>

397
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,980
<font color="yellow">Can you throw out this woman?</font>

398
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,310
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I can't listen any more.</font>

399
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,310
<font color="yellow">It's bad for my baby.</font>

400
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,080
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

401
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,330
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. Excuse me. Oh my gosh.</font>

402
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,710
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Oh my gosh. Excuse me.</font>

403
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,780
<font color="yellow">Don't lose to jerks like that.</font>

404
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
<font color="yellow">Even if we get swayed by money,</font>

405
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,080
<font color="yellow">let's not lose.</font>

406
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,310
<font color="yellow">The kids need a mum...</font>

407
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,080
<font color="yellow">in this crazy world.</font>

408
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
<font color="yellow">Live.</font>

409
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,480
<font color="yellow">Be healthy.</font>

410
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
<font color="yellow">Don't give up.</font>

411
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,190
<font color="yellow">This is where you were.</font>

412
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,560
<font color="yellow">Go in and see your mummy.</font>

413
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,110
<font color="yellow">- Mummy!
-  Good.</font>

414
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,440
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

415
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,240
<font color="yellow">Will she...</font>

416
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,280
<font color="yellow">get surgery?</font>

417
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,040
<font color="yellow">If I choose a patient,</font>

418
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,980
<font color="yellow">it means she will get surgery.</font>

419
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,910
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to say that.</font>

420
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,010
<font color="yellow">It sounded cool.</font>

421
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,570
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know...</font>

422
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,080
<font color="yellow">once the surgery has been scheduled.</font>

423
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,610
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang.</font>

424
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,680
<font color="yellow">I need you...</font>

425
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,510
<font color="yellow">during my surgery.</font>

426
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,480
<font color="yellow">When I want a staff member,</font>

427
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,540
<font color="yellow">that person...</font>

428
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,640
<font color="yellow">must be in my OR.</font>

429
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,640
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

430
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,080
<font color="yellow">If I choose a patient...</font>

431
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,810
<font color="yellow">Once was enough. Don't overdo it.</font>

432
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

433
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,910
<font color="yellow">Mr Nam.</font>

434
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,480

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,610
<font color="yellow">I almost fell for you.</font>

436
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,710
<font color="yellow">Fine. Be that way.</font>

437
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,410
<font color="yellow">Sorry that a mum fell for you.</font>

438
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

439
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,740
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Did something happen?</font>

440
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,910
<font color="yellow">Log into the intranet...</font>

441
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,010
<font color="yellow">and check for yourself.</font>

442
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,240

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,040
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

453
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,640
<font color="yellow">I got pregnant after seven years of marriage.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm almost 40.</font>

455
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,410
<font color="yellow">The hospital told the nurses to take turns having kids.</font>

456
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,080
<font color="yellow">You said to reduce my hours...</font>

<font color="yellow">during pregnancy because it's tiring,</font>

458

<font color="yellow">Ms Jang, what do you think you're doing?</font>

461
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,410
<font color="yellow">There is a process for everything.</font>

462

<font color="yellow">If you have a complaint, you should...</font>

463
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,180
<font color="yellow">Is it because I am pregnant?</font>

464
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,410
<font color="yellow">Is that why you transferred a PA nurse...</font>

465
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,640
<font color="yellow">to manage a medical museum?</font>

466
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,380
<font color="yellow">It's the group being considerate.</font>

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,110
<font color="yellow">seasoned nurses as yourself.</font>

478
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,510
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it.</font>

479
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,010
<font color="yellow">- Director Lee.
-  Would you...</font>

480
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,480
<font color="yellow">please trust me and wait?</font>

481
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,110
<font color="yellow">Is Mr Kang in his office?</font>

482
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,980
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

483
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,880
<font color="yellow">Contrary to the planned downsizing,</font>

484
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,380
<font color="yellow">the experienced nurses are being cut.</font>

485
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,280
<font color="yellow">I need to check for myself.</font>

486
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,010
<font color="yellow">Please, don't do that.</font>

487
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,070
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun.</font>

488
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,510
<font color="yellow">Bringing Hyunsung into the black...</font>

489
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,310
<font color="yellow">is critical for our regenerative medicine.</font>

490
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,540
<font color="yellow">If we stay in the red,</font>

491
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,340
<font color="yellow">we'll have to get outside investors...</font>

492
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,180
<font color="yellow">to get the funding for our research needs.</font>

493
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,680
<font color="yellow">Then our research...</font>

494
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,540
<font color="yellow">will be controlled by money.</font>

495
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,510
<font color="yellow">If the results are influenced by money...</font>

496
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,310
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

497
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,910
<font color="yellow">Rather than prioritise safety,</font>

498
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,540
<font color="yellow">the patients will be used for profit.</font>

499
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,510
<font color="yellow">I want to prevent that...</font>

500
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,850
<font color="yellow">from happening to our regenerative medicine.</font>

501
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,210
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun is correct.</font>

502
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,740
<font color="yellow">If it isn't the best option,</font>

503
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,740
<font color="yellow">you need wisdom to choose the lesser evil.</font>

504
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
<font color="yellow">Please accept...</font>

505
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,140
<font color="yellow">the downsizing.</font>

506
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,810
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

507
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,280
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

508
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,790
<font color="yellow">Ms Lee Hae Joo...</font>

509
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,810
<font color="yellow">will assist Kang Shin Joo's surgery.</font>

510
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,480
<font color="yellow">The nurse that I want...</font>

511
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,380
<font color="yellow">is you, Ms Jang.</font>

512
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,240
<font color="yellow">You know Ms Lee.</font>

513
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,290
<font color="yellow">She's light and quick,</font>

514
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,350
<font color="yellow">so she won't upset you.</font>

515
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,780
<font color="yellow">If I want someone with quicker hands than you,</font>

516
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,510
<font color="yellow">I can find over 100 in this hospital alone.</font>

517
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,440
<font color="yellow">Look, Ms Jang.</font>

518
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,740
<font color="yellow">If Ms Kang changes her mind during surgery,</font>

519
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,810
<font color="yellow">you are the only one...</font>

520
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,210
<font color="yellow">who can change her mind back.</font>

521
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,210
<font color="yellow">That's why I can't do it.</font>

522
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,980
<font color="yellow">It's humiliating.</font>

523
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,810
<font color="yellow">It's humiliating?</font>

524
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,040
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

525
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,340
<font color="yellow">I thought I was fighting well with my baby.</font>

526
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,140
<font color="yellow">Because of the low birth rate,</font>

527
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,480
<font color="yellow">they made it sound like as long I had a baby,</font>

528
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,280
<font color="yellow">society would help raise it.</font>

529
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,080
<font color="yellow">I thought I was a working mum.</font>

530
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

531
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,140
<font color="yellow">But I am...</font>

532
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,610
<font color="yellow">nothing but a way to cut costs here.</font>

533
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,940
<font color="yellow">A money-eating hippo.</font>

534
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,540
<font color="yellow">How could I dare tell Ms Kang...</font>

535
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,440
<font color="yellow">to be strong,</font>

536
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,810
<font color="yellow">that it'll be okay...</font>

537
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,280
<font color="yellow">and to have the baby?</font>

538
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,480
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

539
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,140
<font color="yellow">- Poor Ms Jang.
-  I heard.</font>

540
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,810
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her.</font>

541
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,680
<font color="yellow">How could they do that?</font>

542
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,780
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

543
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,600
<font color="yellow">She's pregnant, too.</font>

544
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,380
<font color="yellow">- What will she do?
-  I heard.</font>

545
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,210
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

546
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,610
<font color="yellow">What are you chatting about?</font>

547
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,980
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang, I have a favour to ask.</font>

548
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,810
<font color="yellow">My patient is a total idiot.</font>

549
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,790
<font color="yellow">When we were in middle school,</font>

550
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,010
<font color="yellow">he'd steal all of my basketball sneakers.</font>

551
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,680
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I met my enemy here.</font>

552
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,810
<font color="yellow">It's a small world.</font>

553
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,940
<font color="yellow">You should be a good person.</font>

554
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,810
<font color="yellow">It was insane yesterday.</font>

555
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,640
<font color="yellow">Blood was gushing from his temporal artery.</font>

556
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,610
<font color="yellow">I didn't know if I should...</font>

557
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,440
<font color="yellow">just leave him or stay with him.</font>

558
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,710
<font color="yellow">But I'm a doctor after all.</font>

559
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,320
<font color="yellow">- I was choosing between life and death...
-  And?</font>

560
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,510
<font color="yellow">Dr Schweitzer that lives in my DNA spoke to me,</font>

561
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,210
<font color="yellow">so I stitched him up perfectly.</font>

562
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,980
<font color="yellow">I bet you made it crooked...</font>

563
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,270
<font color="yellow">and made sure it hurt a lot.</font>

564
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,910
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

565
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,250
<font color="yellow">You need to pinch it hard...</font>

566
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,880
<font color="yellow">when you stitch up the temporal artery.</font>

567
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,720
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

568
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,580
<font color="yellow">You're awesome. High-five.</font>

569
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,610
<font color="yellow">High-five!</font>

570
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,240
<font color="yellow">Give him a strong antibiotic.</font>

571
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,750
<font color="yellow">An antibiotic?</font>

572
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,940
<font color="yellow">Unasyn?</font>

573
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

574
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,780
<font color="yellow">Make sure it hurts.</font>

575
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,180
<font color="yellow">That's what matters.</font>

576
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,640
<font color="yellow">- Dr Yang.
-  Yes?</font>

577
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,110
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  For what?</font>

578
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,350
<font color="yellow">For comforting me.</font>

579
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,410
<font color="yellow">What, did I get caught again?</font>

580
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,640
<font color="yellow">Why am I so nice and considerate?</font>

581
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,210
<font color="yellow">I better run away.</font>

582
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,080
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang Sung Eun said you're a friend of his.</font>

583
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,980
<font color="yellow">He asked me to take good care of you.</font>

584
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,310
<font color="yellow">We were in the same class, but not very close.</font>

585
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,040
<font color="yellow">He got good grades, and his family was rich.</font>

586
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,470
<font color="yellow">He was good at sports, too.</font>

587
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,480
<font color="yellow">He was a jerk though, right?</font>

588
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,120
<font color="yellow">Rub here.</font>

589
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,610
<font color="yellow">The jerk is here.</font>

590
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,310
<font color="yellow">I heard what you two said.</font>

591
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,690
<font color="yellow">I did what you asked me to do.</font>

592
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,780
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the antibiotic, Unasyn?</font>

593
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,940
<font color="yellow">Not that.</font>

594
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,210
<font color="yellow">I made the injection as painful as possible.</font>

595
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

596
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,170
<font color="yellow">Your test result just came out.</font>

597
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,650
<font color="yellow">You're suffering from malnutrition.</font>

598
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,680
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

599
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,650
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You really have malnutrition.</font>

600
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,310
<font color="yellow">- You have an ulcer in your mouth.
-  Gosh.</font>

601
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,410
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm a poor kid in Somalia.</font>

602
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,410
<font color="yellow">Why don't you rest for a week and get a check-up?</font>

603
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
<font color="yellow">I'll get fired.</font>

604
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,980
<font color="yellow">If I take one week of unpaid leave,</font>

605
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,240
<font color="yellow">I'll be kicked out because I can't afford the rent.</font>

606
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,040
<font color="yellow">You're still the same rich boy...</font>

607
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,150
<font color="yellow">who never went through any hardships in life.</font>

608
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,810
<font color="yellow">That's ridiculous.</font>

609
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,440
<font color="yellow">You have no idea what I've been going through here.</font>

610
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,410
<font color="yellow">I work 12 hours a day every day.</font>

611
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,170
<font color="yellow">I don't even have time to go home.</font>

612
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,860
<font color="yellow">I don't have time to date, either. It's hard.</font>

613
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,880
<font color="yellow">My monthly salary is less than 2,000 dollars after tax.</font>

614
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,540
<font color="yellow">Next year, I'll start my fellowship.</font>

615
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,680
<font color="yellow">It's practically an unpaid work.</font>

616
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,150
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

617
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,480
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

618
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,650
<font color="yellow">you're a doctor.</font>

619
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,440
<font color="yellow">When we were in middle school,</font>

620
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,200
<font color="yellow">we sat side by side,</font>

621
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,280
<font color="yellow">but now,</font>

622
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,940
<font color="yellow">we live in different worlds.</font>

623
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,210
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

624
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,710
<font color="yellow">why I stole your sneakers?</font>

625
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,030
<font color="yellow">How would I know that?</font>

626
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,990
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see the boy who has everything...</font>

627
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,340
<font color="yellow">get angry.</font>

628
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,910
<font color="yellow">But I failed.</font>

629
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,980
<font color="yellow">You came to school in a new pair of shoes.</font>

630
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,410
<font color="yellow">They were nicer than the old ones.</font>

631
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,410
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Listen to me.</font>

632
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,010
<font color="yellow">There's an artery right here.</font>

633
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,730
<font color="yellow">I'm getting angry as I think about that incident.</font>

634
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,880
<font color="yellow">My hands are starting to shake.</font>

635
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,070
<font color="yellow">If my hands keep shaking, I might damage your artery.</font>

636
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,780
<font color="yellow">Do you still want me to get angry?</font>

637
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

638
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,910
<font color="yellow">I was young.</font>

639
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,560
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Life is so unfair.</font>

640
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,110
<font color="yellow">I remembered you, but you didn't recognise me.</font>

641
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,580
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's just because...</font>

642
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,250
<font color="yellow">your appearance changed so much.</font>

643
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,150
<font color="yellow">You look a bit burnt, too. That's why...</font>

644
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,650
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey!</font>

645
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,540
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Hey!</font>

646
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,780
<font color="yellow">Nurse!</font>

647
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

648
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,870
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms Jang Moon Kyung?</font>

649
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,210
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

650
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,650
<font color="yellow">She gave my patient...</font>

651
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,410
<font color="yellow">an antibiotic and he's in anaphylactic shock.</font>

652
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,980
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms Jang?</font>

653
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,980
<font color="yellow">Why is he in anaphylactic shock?</font>

654
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,380
<font color="yellow">I gave him Unasyn as you told me.</font>

655
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,810
<font color="yellow">Did you do a skin allergy test?</font>

656
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,410
<font color="yellow">It's essential to do that before giving Unasyn.</font>

657
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
<font color="yellow">Of course, I did.</font>

658
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,310
<font color="yellow">I attended to patients longer than you did.</font>

659
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,710
<font color="yellow">I would never make that kind of mistake.</font>

660
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,740
<font color="yellow">You can't...</font>

661
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,880
<font color="yellow">Maybe you were mistaken.</font>

662
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,610
<font color="yellow">What else could have caused it?</font>

663
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,010
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang probably thought...</font>

664
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,360
<font color="yellow">the transfer was unfair,</font>

665
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,940
<font color="yellow">so she decided to get back at the hospital.</font>

666
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,480
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't make such a basic mistake.</font>

667
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,710
<font color="yellow">She's too soft-hearted to do that.</font>

668
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,240
<font color="yellow">She's carrying a baby, too.</font>

669
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo.</font>

670
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,080
<font color="yellow">Not everyone is like you.</font>

671
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,670
<font color="yellow">She must have been distracted.</font>

672
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,450
<font color="yellow">You know how hard she worked...</font>

673
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,740
<font color="yellow">to become a PA nurse despite her pregnancy.</font>

674
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,980
<font color="yellow">It really is unfair.</font>

675
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,680
<font color="yellow">Why would she work at a museum?</font>

676
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,590
<font color="yellow">They want her to resign.</font>

677
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,440
<font color="yellow">They couldn't say they didn't want a pregnant employee.</font>

678
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,410
<font color="yellow">Use your brain.</font>

679
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,110
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang has a good reputation.</font>

680
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,610
<font color="yellow">The union won't let this slide.</font>

681
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,410
<font color="yellow">So the hospital is giving her the choice...</font>

682
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,240
<font color="yellow">to accept the transfer or quit her job.</font>

683
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,380
<font color="yellow">It's a conspiracy theory.</font>

684
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,580
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung Medical Centre is the conspirator...</font>

685
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,540
<font color="yellow">in this theory.</font>

686
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,440
<font color="yellow">Why did you ambush us like that?</font>

687
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,620
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

688
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,010
<font color="yellow">How long have you been here, Dr Lee?</font>

689
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,810
<font color="yellow">I was here before you came in...</font>

690
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,540
<font color="yellow">and started this enthusiastic discussion.</font>

691
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,650
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

692
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,240
<font color="yellow">regardless of whether or not it was a mistake,</font>

693
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,010
<font color="yellow">or if the hospital administrators conspired,</font>

694
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,910
<font color="yellow">the patient is suffering from anaphylactic shock...</font>

695
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,510
<font color="yellow">because of what Ms Jang did.</font>

696
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
<font color="yellow">Is that correct?</font>

697
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,940
<font color="yellow">How is he doing?</font>

698
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
<font color="yellow">He was...</font>

699
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,810
<font color="yellow">He was brought here for malnutrition.</font>

700
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,740
<font color="yellow">Now, he's suffering from anaphylactic shock.</font>

701
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,680
<font color="yellow">My friend here...</font>

702
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,380
<font color="yellow">can't even afford a health examination.</font>

703
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,810
<font color="yellow">Your friend?</font>

704
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,600
<font color="yellow">Is he your friend?</font>

705
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,040
<font color="yellow">He and I went to the same school.</font>

706
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
<font color="yellow">He's a friend of mine.</font>

707
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,340
<font color="yellow">- No reaction.
-  It seems...</font>

708
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,740
<font color="yellow">that he hasn't eaten well maybe because he was busy.</font>

709
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,180
<font color="yellow">He has an ulcer in his mouth.</font>

710
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,240
<font color="yellow">I examined him yesterday.</font>

711
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,780
<font color="yellow">All of his joints are damaged...</font>

712
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,040
<font color="yellow">probably because he worked too hard.</font>

713
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,380
<font color="yellow">He has joint pains, as well?</font>

714
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

715
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,610
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, we always...</font>

716
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,810
<font color="yellow">complain...</font>

717
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,810
<font color="yellow">that we work more than the maximum hours.</font>

718
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,380
<font color="yellow">But he...</font>

719
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,440
<font color="yellow">Are you worried because he's your friend?</font>

720
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,880
<font color="yellow">Or are you pitying him...</font>

721
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,110
<font color="yellow">because he's poor?</font>

722
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,880
<font color="yellow">If you let your emotions cloud your judgement,</font>

723
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,910
<font color="yellow">you won't find out what caused the anaphylactic shock.</font>

724
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,790
<font color="yellow">Although, you may be able to comfort yourself...</font>

725
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,740
<font color="yellow">by thinking that you're a good person.</font>

726
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

727
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,280
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't see Ms Jang...</font>

728
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,310
<font color="yellow">doing a skin allergy test, right?</font>

729
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

730
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,680
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms Jang?</font>

731
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,150
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

732
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,810
<font color="yellow">didn't do anything wrong.</font>

733
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,810
<font color="yellow">I've worked in this hospital for a long time.</font>

734
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,110
<font color="yellow">I don't want to leave being falsely accused like this.</font>

735
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,180
<font color="yellow">I believe you're not in a position...</font>

736
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,920
<font color="yellow">to argue what's right or wrong in this matter.</font>

737
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,940
<font color="yellow">At least...</font>

738
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,940
<font color="yellow">give me a chance to prove it wasn't my mistake, please.</font>

739
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,010
<font color="yellow">Please put off the transfer until then. I'll stay...</font>

740
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,810
<font color="yellow">He's in anaphylactic shock. What more should I say?</font>

741
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,980
<font color="yellow">If you complicate this situation,</font>

742
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,350
<font color="yellow">it'll damage the reputation of the hospital...</font>

743
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:30,210
<font color="yellow">and you'll be labelled for committing malpractice.</font>

744
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,980
<font color="yellow">She didn't...</font>

745
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,650
<font color="yellow">make any mistakes.</font>

746
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,280
<font color="yellow">What happened to the patient...</font>

747
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,110
<font color="yellow">wasn't because of Ms Jang.</font>

748
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,650
<font color="yellow">It wasn't medical malpractice, either.</font>

749
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,150
<font color="yellow">It turns out that he doesn't have malnutrition.</font>

750
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,910
<font color="yellow">He has lupus.</font>

751
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,580
<font color="yellow">His face was sunburned severely...</font>

752
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,080
<font color="yellow">due to light sensitivity, a symptom of lupus.</font>

753
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,610
<font color="yellow">The mouth ulcer...</font>

754
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,150
<font color="yellow">and the joint pains...</font>

755
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,040
<font color="yellow">are symptoms of lupus, as well.</font>

756
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,380
<font color="yellow">He has lupus?</font>

757
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,080
<font color="yellow">Then, he shouldn't have been prescribed Unasyn.</font>

758
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
<font color="yellow">That's correct.</font>

759
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,980
<font color="yellow">It wasn't Ms Jang...</font>

760
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
<font color="yellow">who caused the anaphylactic shock.</font>

761
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,770
<font color="yellow">It happened because there weren't...</font>

762
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,150
<font color="yellow">seasoned nurses like Ms Jang...</font>

763
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,180
<font color="yellow">in the emergency room.</font>

764
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,050
<font color="yellow">The culprit is the cheap substitute workers...</font>

765
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,180
<font color="yellow">who didn't look into the patient's medical history...</font>

766
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,610
<font color="yellow">and didn't do the drug allergy test.</font>

767
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,650
<font color="yellow">More precisely,</font>

768
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,210
<font color="yellow">the real cause was...</font>

769
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,280
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang Hyun Joon's cost cutting plan.</font>

770
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,440
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang...</font>

771
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,910
<font color="yellow">isn't the cause of losses for this hospital.</font>

772
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,110
<font color="yellow">She's my surgical assistant.</font>

773
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang,</font>

774
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,880
<font color="yellow">do you think you can assist me...</font>

775
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,380
<font color="yellow">on the surgery of Patient Kang Shin Joo?</font>

776
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,810
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang?</font>

777
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,940
<font color="yellow">I'll book an OR.</font>

778
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,080
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

779
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,040
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Mum.
-  Yes, Mum.</font>

780
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,440
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

781
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,780
<font color="yellow">You two wait here, okay?</font>

782
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,440
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Good boys.</font>

783
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,010
<font color="yellow">I'll begin the surgery.</font>

784
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,380
<font color="yellow">I'll start with an EVD.</font>

785
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,910
<font color="yellow">Let's begin.</font>

786
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,210
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

787
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,810
<font color="yellow">Why are you smiling at the reflection of yourself?</font>

788
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,710
<font color="yellow">I'm not. A doctor should know how to treat diseases.</font>

789
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
<font color="yellow">Is your first task as the director...</font>

790
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,480
<font color="yellow">fighting against me over authority?</font>

791
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,350
<font color="yellow">You want me to cancel the reorganisation of manpower?</font>

792
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,410
<font color="yellow">The mistakes of inexperienced nurses...</font>

793
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,280
<font color="yellow">are causing medical malpractices.</font>

794
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,080
<font color="yellow">The complaints will lead to lawsuits,</font>

795
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,440
<font color="yellow">and the legal expenses...</font>

796
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,640
<font color="yellow">will cost the hospital a fortune.</font>

797
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,540
<font color="yellow">This balance sheet will show you...</font>

798
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,070
<font color="yellow">how much more the unreasonable reorganisation...</font>

799
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,440
<font color="yellow">will cost the hospital.</font>

800
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,210
<font color="yellow">Like they say, "Office changes manners."</font>

801
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,710
<font color="yellow">You're learning very quickly.</font>

802
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,380
<font color="yellow">Chairman Kang Il Do, your father,</font>

803
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,810
<font color="yellow">is looking at the same report as we speak.</font>

804
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,340
<font color="yellow">You're good at calculating profits and losses.</font>

805
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,040
<font color="yellow">I believe we will come to the same conclusion.</font>

806
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,440
<font color="yellow">You once said...</font>

807
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,710
<font color="yellow">that a monster like me...</font>

808
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,540
<font color="yellow">doesn't belong in this hospital.</font>

809
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,810
<font color="yellow">This hospital values profit more than lives...</font>

810
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,310
<font color="yellow">and you are the current director of this place.</font>

811
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,880
<font color="yellow">Which one of us is the real monster?</font>

812
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,180
<font color="yellow">Oh, wow. What's this?</font>

813
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,410
<font color="yellow">Where are your manners?</font>

814
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,310
<font color="yellow">When you receive a present,</font>

815
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,710
<font color="yellow">you should at least pretend to be happy or open it.</font>

816
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,680
<font color="yellow">Let's call it even.</font>

817
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,940
<font color="yellow">I know they're not good enough for your preference.</font>

818
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,980
<font color="yellow">You can wear them when you work.</font>

819
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,010
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

820
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,810
<font color="yellow">I feel like the burden of guilt has been...</font>

821
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,240
<font color="yellow">lifted off my shoulders.</font>

822
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,580
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll buy you a drink later.</font>

823
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,040
<font color="yellow">Let's not make promises we won't keep.</font>

824
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,140
<font color="yellow">I don't think we'll ever meet again.</font>

825
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

826
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:51,940
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

827
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,410
<font color="yellow">Wait up.</font>

828
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,880
<font color="yellow">Hey, Patient.</font>

829
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,980
<font color="yellow">Lupus is not a fatal disease.</font>

830
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,060
<font color="yellow">You should take good care of yourself.</font>

831
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,160
<font color="yellow">Be careful in the sun.</font>

832
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,310
<font color="yellow">Try to avoid working too much and getting stressed.</font>

833
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

834
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,950
<font color="yellow">I work outside in the sun all day long...</font>

835
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,050
<font color="yellow">to install air conditioners.</font>

836
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,480
<font color="yellow">I always work overtime.</font>

837
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,240
<font color="yellow">So thank you for your advice.</font>

838
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,780
<font color="yellow">- Just go.
-  Get back to work.</font>

839
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

840
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,980
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee,</font>

841
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,680
<font color="yellow">I was a good doctor to my friend thanks to you.</font>

842
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,180
<font color="yellow">He even gave me a present.</font>

843
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,180
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your help.</font>

844
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,280
<font color="yellow">You should be thanking...</font>

845
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,680
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang.</font>

846
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,440
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

847
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,180
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang, please.</font>

848
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,480
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

849
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,240
<font color="yellow">He bought me shoes.</font>

850
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,710
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

851
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,240
<font color="yellow">Patient Kang Shin Joo decided...</font>

852
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,810
<font color="yellow">to give up on this baby.</font>

853
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,340
<font color="yellow">She can't afford to raise the baby.</font>

854
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,510
<font color="yellow">The baby was needed by everyone,</font>

855
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,110
<font color="yellow">but in the end, wanted by no one.</font>

856
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,680
<font color="yellow">Still, I'm happy that you came into this world.</font>

857
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,940
<font color="yellow">Sometimes in life,</font>

858
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,440
<font color="yellow">someone you didn't expect reaches out to help you.</font>

859
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,580
<font color="yellow">I saw a miraculous thing like that happen.</font>

860
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,240
<font color="yellow">It will happen to you, as well.</font>

861
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,880
<font color="yellow">You'll figure out how to go on with your life.</font>

862
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,380
<font color="yellow">Welcome to this world.</font>

863
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,680
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

864
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,810
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

865
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,480
<font color="yellow">Would it be okay if I give you my answer now?</font>

866
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,210
<font color="yellow">Right here? On this street?</font>

867
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,380
<font color="yellow">You want to give me your answer...</font>

868
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,080
<font color="yellow">on this crowded, noisy street?</font>

869
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,280
<font color="yellow">Then, where should we...</font>

870
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,010
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

871
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,980
<font color="yellow">may I tell you my answer now?</font>

872
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,810
<font color="yellow">I thought a lot...</font>

873
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,580
<font color="yellow">about you...</font>

874
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,680
<font color="yellow">and about me.</font>

875
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,040
<font color="yellow">I mean, about us.</font>

876
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,480
<font color="yellow">- I've decided...
-  It's so nice.</font>

877
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,880
<font color="yellow">The air tonight is so nice.</font>

878
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,620
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee...</font>

879
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,740
<font color="yellow">Please give me your hand.</font>

880
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,400
<font color="yellow">- Your hand.
-  My hand?</font>

881
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,910
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
-  Why?</font>

882
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,510
<font color="yellow">- Stand up.
-  Okay.</font>

883
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,810
<font color="yellow">You're very nervous.</font>

884
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,140
<font color="yellow">- I am?
-  Yes.</font>

885
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,980
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be better to talk later...</font>

886
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,210
<font color="yellow">when you feel more relaxed?</font>

887
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,450
<font color="yellow">Playing a sport...</font>

888
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,010
<font color="yellow">is the best way to relieve nervousness.</font>

889
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,180
<font color="yellow">- Shall we play a game?
-  Pardon?</font>

890
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,310
<font color="yellow">Throw it.</font>

891
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,540
<font color="yellow">- Can I just throw it?
-  Yes.</font>

892
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,740
<font color="yellow">- Did you see that?
-  Yes, I saw it.</font>

893
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,980
<font color="yellow">You pulled it off at your first attempt.</font>

894
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,510
<font color="yellow">- One more time. Good luck.
-  Here I go.</font>

895
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,680
<font color="yellow">I'm good at this, right?</font>

896
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,560
<font color="yellow">You're not bad.</font>

897
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,580
<font color="yellow">Give me the ball.</font>

898
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,380
<font color="yellow">Here I go.</font>

899
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,480
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

900
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,230
<font color="yellow">Foul.</font>

901
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,410
<font color="yellow">- Stop.
-  Goodness.</font>

902
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,300
<font color="yellow">That's it. No!</font>

903
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,310
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

904
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
<font color="yellow">It's in.</font>

905
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,580
<font color="yellow">Wait. No!</font>

906
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,110
<font color="yellow">- You're travelling!
-  I am!</font>

907
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,180
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. No!</font>

908
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,880
<font color="yellow">- Come this way.
-  This way?</font>

909
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,020
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

910
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,040
<font color="yellow">Shoot!</font>

911
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,910
<font color="yellow">That was the first half.</font>

912
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,810
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  The second half begins now.</font>

913
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,100
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, I'm too exhausted. I can't play any more.</font>

914
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,110
<font color="yellow">Why not? You're on fire today.</font>

915
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,110
<font color="yellow">Let's keep playing. It's fun.</font>

916
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

917
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,310
<font color="yellow">Are you really tired?</font>

918
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

919
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,910
<font color="yellow">I guess that's it for today.</font>

920
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,740
<font color="yellow">Since you're tired,</font>

921
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,710
<font color="yellow">let's leave our talk for tomorrow, too.</font>

922
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,440
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

923
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,740
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Dr Lee.</font>

924
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,940
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

925
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,310
<font color="yellow">Don't you see why I'm being this way?</font>

926
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,140
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

927
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,910
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

928
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,980
<font color="yellow">have never been afraid...</font>

929
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,610
<font color="yellow">in my life.</font>

930
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,080
<font color="yellow">Not even once. However,</font>

931
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,380
<font color="yellow">right now,</font>

932
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,740
<font color="yellow">you're the one making me most afraid.</font>

933
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,880
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid of what you might say...</font>

934
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,110
<font color="yellow">and upon hearing your words,</font>

935
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,140
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I'd react.</font>

936
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

937
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,240
<font color="yellow">what I'm afraid of.</font>

938
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,680
<font color="yellow">Let's have our talk...</font>

939
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,640
<font color="yellow">tomorrow.</font>

940
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,710
<font color="yellow">This is my answer.</font>

941
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,940
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't let me speak.</font>

942
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,640
<font color="yellow">I know I'm not ready for this,</font>

943
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,610
<font color="yellow">but if it's with you, I'd like to give it a shot.</font>

944
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,640
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the drink.</font>

945
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,440
<font color="yellow">Min Jae, you were right.</font>

946
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,440
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

947
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,810
<font color="yellow">I'm changing.</font>

948
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,610
<font color="yellow">I want an MRI.</font>

949
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,610
<font color="yellow">The result is out.</font>

950
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,880
<font color="yellow">It's just as I expected.</font>

951
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,710
<font color="yellow">Director Lee.</font>

952
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,310
<font color="yellow">The worst scenario happened.</font>

953
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,140
<font color="yellow">We got a massive amount of foreign investments.</font>

954
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,580
<font color="yellow">Is it true...</font>

955
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,880
<font color="yellow">that we're accepting foreign investments?</font>

956
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,280
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time, my friend.</font>

957
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,970
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

958
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,880
<font color="yellow">He fell off a building at a construction site.</font>

959
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,310
<font color="yellow">He fell while installing air conditioners.</font>

960
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,880
<font color="yellow">Sir, Sir.</font>

961
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,210
<font color="yellow">There was no safety bar there.</font>

962
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,140
<font color="yellow">He was installing them without any safety equipment.</font>

963
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,250
<font color="yellow">Epidural.</font>

964
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,880
<font color="yellow">Get him an epidural right now.</font>

965
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

966
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,380
<font color="yellow">- Where's the emergency patient?
-  In the ER.</font>

967
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,380
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

968
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,580
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

969
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,980
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

970
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,650
<font color="yellow">just discharged him.</font>

971
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,450
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

972
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,710
<font color="yellow">He fell while installing...</font>

973
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,780
<font color="yellow">an air conditioner.</font>

974
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:51,780
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

975
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,180
<font color="yellow">How could this happen?</font>

976
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,180
<font color="yellow">I saved his life...</font>

977
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,680
<font color="yellow">only hours ago.</font>

978
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,080
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

979
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,440
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way.</font>

980
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,610
<font color="yellow">Doctor, please save him.</font>

981
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,710
<font color="yellow">Please save him.</font>

982
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,740
<font color="yellow">This doesn't make any sense.</font>

983
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,910
<font color="yellow">How could he die so easily?</font>

984
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,110
<font color="yellow">How can it be this easy?</font>

985
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,910
<font color="yellow">We did everything we could...</font>

986
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,210
<font color="yellow">in order to save him.</font>

987
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:56,280
<font color="yellow">Doctor, we can't just let him die like this.</font>

988
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,010
<font color="yellow">This isn't right.</font>

989
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
<font color="yellow">Han Mo.</font>

990
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,080
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

991
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,210
<font color="yellow">never learned how to cry.</font>

992
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,480
<font color="yellow">The dysfunction on your frontal lobe...</font>

993
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,910
<font color="yellow">is just as how it was.</font>

994
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,110
<font color="yellow">Nothing has changed.</font>

995
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,110
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

996
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:40,960
<font color="yellow">Is now the time...</font>

997
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,340
<font color="yellow">you need Wi-Fi?</font>

998
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,610
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

999
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,340
<font color="yellow">The signal...</font>

1000
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,310
<font color="yellow">was never there.</font>

1001
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,910
<font color="yellow">Not even once.</font>

1002
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,510
<font color="yellow">I have been fooled all this time.</font>

1003
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,610
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

1004
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,040
<font color="yellow">don't want to deceive you.</font>

1005
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:06,910
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

1006
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,140
<font color="yellow">I never changed.</font>

1007
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,440
<font color="yellow">I'm still the same,</font>

1008
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,140
<font color="yellow">and I will always be like this.</font>

1009
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,180
<font color="yellow">You and I are over now.</font>

1010
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,010
<font color="yellow">End of...</font>

<font color="yellow">(Beautiful Mind)</font>

1013
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,800
<font color="yellow">Can you pretend that nothing ever happened?</font>

1014
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,610
<font color="yellow">Is that possible for you?</font>

1015
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,680
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

1016
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,880
<font color="yellow">Should I tell her that she's going to be paralysed...</font>

1017
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,960
<font color="yellow">and needs a respirator for the rest of her life?</font>

1018

<font color="yellow">Surgery won't be easy.</font>

1019
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,940
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you to give us some time...</font>

1020
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,490
<font color="yellow">so we can be together.</font>

1021

<font color="yellow">"Time so we can be together..."</font>

1022
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,040
<font color="yellow">Is it your patient's wish or your own?</font>

1023
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,620
<font color="yellow">I'm curious myself.</font>

1024

<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

1025
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,440
<font color="yellow">I wonder which side he'll take.</font>
