00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,170
<font color="yellow">Suddenly announcing it to the nation...</font>

162
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,160
<font color="yellow">without the research team's consent...</font>

163
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
<font color="yellow">You should focus...</font>

164
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,840
<font color="yellow">on just the research.</font>

165
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,320
<font color="yellow">You will be the first surgeon ever to succeed in...</font>

166
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,970
<font color="yellow">a stem cell transplant.</font>

167
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,410
<font color="yellow">I will handle hospital administration.</font>

168
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,440
<font color="yellow">I'll support you whole-heartedly.</font>

169
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,370
<font color="yellow">To further Director Shin's mission...</font>

170
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,070
<font color="yellow">Director Shin and I...</font>

171
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,110
<font color="yellow">began researching regenerative medicine...</font>

172
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,770
<font color="yellow">in hopes...</font>

173
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,410
<font color="yellow">that there will come a day when surgeons...</font>

174
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,170
<font color="yellow">will no longer be needed.</font>

175
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,240
<font color="yellow">Not to be the first in something...</font>

176
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,310
<font color="yellow">and definitely not to pursue fame and stardom.</font>

177
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,410
<font color="yellow">But did you know...</font>

178
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,510
<font color="yellow">that Director Shin...</font>

179
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,570
<font color="yellow">was very paranoid.</font>

180
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,310
<font color="yellow">He hated letting anyone know of his illness.</font>

181
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,840
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

182
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,110
<font color="yellow">also know...</font>

183
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,570
<font color="yellow">that he had diabetes?</font>

184
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,570
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it already proved...</font>

185
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,040
<font color="yellow">that Dr Kim Yoon Kyung was responsible for his death?</font>

186
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,370
<font color="yellow">I simply wanted to confirm the truth.</font>

187
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,510
<font color="yellow">I thought you didn't know him well enough...</font>

188
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,070

194
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,040
<font color="yellow">Director Lee, won't you?</font>

195
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,040
<font color="yellow">Of course, I will.</font>

196
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,210
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Director Lee.</font>

197
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,310
<font color="yellow">It was by unanimous vote.</font>

198

<font color="yellow">Director Lee Gun Myung, who values reputation,</font>

207

208

<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

209
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,710
<font color="yellow">I put our reputation in his hands.</font>

210
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,210

<font color="yellow">He won't be able to do much even as the director.</font>

<font color="yellow">Eventually,</font>

214

<font color="yellow">the patients will know that one of our surgeons...</font>

215
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,010
<font color="yellow">is a psychopath.</font>

<font color="yellow">one eye...</font>

221
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,410

<font color="yellow">One eye keeps shaking.</font>

223
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,410
<font color="yellow">I have a splitting headache which won't go away.</font>

<font color="yellow">You have a splitting headache which won't go away.</font>

225
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,470
<font color="yellow">And your eyes shake. Just a minute.</font>

00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,040
<font color="yellow">you were treated for alcoholism before.</font>

228
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,840
<font color="yellow">I presume that you still drink.</font>

229
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,040
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

230

<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to kill myself.</font>

231

<font color="yellow">Not at all. No way.</font>

232
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,010
<font color="yellow">Look into the patient's eyes.</font>

233
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,040
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

234
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,610
<font color="yellow">Give him a warm greeting.</font>

235
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,010
<font color="yellow">It was tiring coming to the hospital, wasn't it?</font>

236
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,040
<font color="yellow">Yes. Pardon?</font>

237
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,670
<font color="yellow">Be courteous...</font>

238
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,440
<font color="yellow">and listen to the patient.</font>

239
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,870
<font color="yellow">Please tell me.</font>

240
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,380
<font color="yellow">As your doctor,</font>

241

247
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,620
<font color="yellow">just prescribe me my medicine.</font>

248
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,390
<font color="yellow">It's hard coming to the hospital for a prescription.</font>

249
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,640
<font color="yellow">I need to make a living.</font>

250
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,210
<font color="yellow">Think from the patient's perspective.</font>

251
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,870

<font color="yellow">I am a doctor. A doctor.</font>

264
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,540
<font color="yellow">I decide what is...</font>

265
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,180

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,900
<font color="yellow">- the new detective?
-  What?</font>

318
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,310
<font color="yellow">- Thank you!
-  You two can be partners.</font>

319
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,570
<font color="yellow">What? You punk.</font>

320
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,990
<font color="yellow">We're going to a crime scene.</font>

321
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,610
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  I'll see you later.</font>

322
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,110
<font color="yellow">Why those...</font>

323
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,540
<font color="yellow">Did you check your horoscope for today?</font>

324
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,180
<font color="yellow">I don't believe in that.</font>

325
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
<font color="yellow">You should read it.</font>

326
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it is...</font>

327
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,210
<font color="yellow">filled with good fortune...</font>

328
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
<font color="yellow">with respect to new jobs, people, career and the like.</font>

329
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,680
<font color="yellow">What? Was that too difficult to understand?</font>

330
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,840
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

331
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,410
<font color="yellow">I mean you lucked out with a great lieutenant.</font>

332
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

333
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,410
<font color="yellow">Don't forget.</font>

334
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,610
<font color="yellow">You must become a Violent Crimes detective first.</font>

335
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,510
<font color="yellow">Reopening Hyunsung's investigation...</font>

336
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,410
<font color="yellow">comes after.</font>

337
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

338
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,940
<font color="yellow">You knew?</font>

339
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,370
<font color="yellow">Is that why you took me in?</font>

340
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,370
<font color="yellow">Then do you...</font>

341
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,110
<font color="yellow">Armed robbery at a jewellery store in Jungbu 7 dong.</font>

342
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,370
<font color="yellow">Violent Crimes detectives requested.</font>

343
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,940
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

344
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
<font color="yellow">It's your first case.</font>

345
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,770
<font color="yellow">Get ready.</font>

346
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

347
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,680
<font color="yellow">Call the police if you want!</font>

348
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,740
<font color="yellow">Hold your hands up.</font>

349
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,340
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to fear.</font>

350
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,010
<font color="yellow">Call the police if you want!</font>

351
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,110
<font color="yellow">- Calm down.
-  He's a first-time offender.</font>

352
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,310
<font color="yellow">How can you tell?</font>

353
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,810
<font color="yellow">I can tell just by looking at the back of his head.</font>

354
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,910
<font color="yellow">It is strange.</font>

355
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,120
<font color="yellow">He has a weapon,</font>

356
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,920
<font color="yellow">but the robber is the one who's shaking.</font>

357
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,900
<font color="yellow">He's doing something out of character.</font>

358
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,440
<font color="yellow">It's so obvious.</font>

359
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,610
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

360
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,470
<font color="yellow">You've been trained, right?</font>

361
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

362
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,370
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

363
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,110
<font color="yellow">Drop your weapon.</font>

364
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,170
<font color="yellow">Drop your weapon!</font>

365
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,440
<font color="yellow">Do you want trouble?</font>

366
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,470
<font color="yellow">Drop your weapon!</font>

367
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,340
<font color="yellow">Put it...</font>

368
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,310
<font color="yellow">down.</font>

369
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

370
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,770
<font color="yellow">Let me go!</font>

371
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,940
<font color="yellow">Let's walk out together.</font>

372
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,310
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

373
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,440
<font color="yellow">No one will get hurt.</font>

374
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,520
<font color="yellow">He fainted at the crime scene.</font>

375
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,640
<font color="yellow">He's a patient here, right?</font>

376
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,810
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a suicide attempt this time.</font>

377
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,240
<font color="yellow">Get his records and his chart.</font>

378
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

379
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,870
<font color="yellow">He tried to kill himself?</font>

380
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,310
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

381
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,440
<font color="yellow">What do you think is wrong with him?</font>

382
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,370
<font color="yellow">We'll know when the test results come out.</font>

383
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,210
<font color="yellow">Let's call his family.</font>

384
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

385
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,470
<font color="yellow">That patient...</font>

386
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,670
<font color="yellow">Do you remember him?</font>

387
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,640
<font color="yellow">He left a huge impression last time.</font>

388
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,030
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

389
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,570
<font color="yellow">Try to lie back down.</font>

390
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,010
<font color="yellow">Get off of me! Who said to bring me here?</font>

391
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,350
<font color="yellow">I know what you mean,</font>

392
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,440
<font color="yellow">so please stop.</font>

393
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,510
<font color="yellow">You know who I am, right?</font>

394
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,870
<font color="yellow">You hurt yourself last time because of your illness.</font>

395
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,340
<font color="yellow">It means your illness worsened so much...</font>

396
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,470
<font color="yellow">that you couldn't help but hurt yourself.</font>

397
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,940
<font color="yellow">But it was a foolish decision.</font>

398
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,340
<font color="yellow">Next time, ask for a painkiller.</font>

399
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,940
<font color="yellow">We have painkillers that aren't addictive.</font>

400
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,010
<font color="yellow">These are good times.</font>

401
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,290
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

402
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,440
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

403
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

404
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,770
<font color="yellow">- Don't say that!
-  Doctor.</font>

405
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,070
<font color="yellow">Doctor. Please listen to me.</font>

406
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,210
<font color="yellow">I didn't do that to come back here.</font>

407
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,970
<font color="yellow">I need to get out of here. Let me go.</font>

408
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,970
<font color="yellow">- Please?
-  That's enough.</font>

409
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,600
<font color="yellow">Please, doctor. Please.</font>

410
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,940
<font color="yellow">We're going to call the police.</font>

411
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,300
<font color="yellow">He's a thief.</font>

412
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,940
<font color="yellow">He was caught at the scene.</font>

413
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,370
<font color="yellow">The Violent Crimes detectives brought him in.</font>

414
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,840
<font color="yellow">I'll get the police.</font>

415
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,640
<font color="yellow">Officer Gye.</font>

416
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,840
<font color="yellow">She's a detective.</font>

417
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,610
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

418
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,170
<font color="yellow">How is he?</font>

419
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,170
<font color="yellow">We need to process him...</font>

420
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,240
<font color="yellow">I refuse to be treated.</font>

421
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,220
<font color="yellow">I refuse.</font>

422
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,130
<font color="yellow">Let go. I need to go. I need to go right now!</font>

423
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,140
<font color="yellow">I need to go!</font>

424
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,480
<font color="yellow">I need to drain the fluid from his head.</font>

425
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,510
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

426
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,240
<font color="yellow">There is no problem...</font>

427
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,710
<font color="yellow">as of now.</font>

428
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,670
<font color="yellow">There is no problem?</font>

429
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,670
<font color="yellow">He looked pretty serious.</font>

430
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,670
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

431
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,410
<font color="yellow">Stage four lung cancer and it spread to his brain.</font>

432
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,580
<font color="yellow">On top of that, he developed...</font>

433
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,870
<font color="yellow">a tolerance to the chemotherapy drugs,</font>

434
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,740
<font color="yellow">so regardless of what treatment he gets,</font>

435
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,810
<font color="yellow">it will have no effect.</font>

436
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,170
<font color="yellow">Then what do you mean, there is no problem?</font>

437
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,670
<font color="yellow">Do you see it?</font>

438
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,840
<font color="yellow">The physicians couldn't find a treatment,</font>

439
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,910
<font color="yellow">and the patient refused treatment.</font>

440
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,170
<font color="yellow">He won't receive treatment.</font>

441
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,340
<font color="yellow">Both sides came to the same conclusion.</font>

442
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,840
<font color="yellow">So, there is no problem.</font>

443
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,570
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

444
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,840
<font color="yellow">You say many things...</font>

445
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,170
<font color="yellow">that sound correct the first time,</font>

446
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,340
<font color="yellow">but when you think about it,</font>

447
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,970
<font color="yellow">it is completely wrong.</font>

448
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,640
<font color="yellow">That's exactly this situation.</font>

449
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,310
<font color="yellow">Everyone wants to be treated.</font>

450
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,570
<font color="yellow">At least,</font>

451
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,240
<font color="yellow">that's how it was for me.</font>

452
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,970
<font color="yellow">It isn't true, is it?</font>

453
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,340
<font color="yellow">It's not like you to do this.</font>

454
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,410
<font color="yellow">Say something. She'll get sick.</font>

455
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,970
<font color="yellow">Give us an excuse or an explanation. Something.</font>

456
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,770
<font color="yellow">You brat. Did you really do it?</font>

457
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,740
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with him?</font>

458
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,370
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to kill Mum, too?</font>

459
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,410
<font color="yellow">Do you know what we're...</font>

460
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,500
<font color="yellow">What? What?</font>

461
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,840
<font color="yellow">What? What are you going through?</font>

462
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,010
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

463
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,570
<font color="yellow">please stop.</font>

464
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,070
<font color="yellow">Don't think about...</font>

465
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,470
<font color="yellow">selling the store just to try to save me.</font>

466
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,640
<font color="yellow">I have no hope anyway.</font>

467
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,140
<font color="yellow">It's all over.</font>

468
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,740
<font color="yellow">Why is it over?</font>

469
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,070
<font color="yellow">You have me.</font>

470
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,740
<font color="yellow">Your mum is alive.</font>

471
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,140
<font color="yellow">How could I let you go?</font>

472
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,470
<font color="yellow">I won't let you go.</font>

473
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
<font color="yellow">Detective.</font>

474
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,870
<font color="yellow">How long do I have to wait?</font>

475
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,490
<font color="yellow">Take me to jail, detention, anywhere!</font>

476
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,510
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

477
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,610
<font color="yellow">Don't say that in front of your mother.</font>

478
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,770
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come with me?</font>

479
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,040
<font color="yellow">Who has family take care of them in this time and age?</font>

480
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,510
<font color="yellow">Money is the best solution. Don't you agree?</font>

481
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

482
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,070
<font color="yellow">Are you just going to stand there and watch?</font>

483
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,170
<font color="yellow">If you're so lazy with your weight,</font>

484
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,010
<font color="yellow">it'll be hard when you have kids.</font>

485
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,040
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

486
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,040
<font color="yellow">I'm allergic to anything non-organic.</font>

487
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,790
<font color="yellow">Next time,</font>

488
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,070
<font color="yellow">call the service worker, okay?</font>

489
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,170
<font color="yellow">Your husband must not make much money.</font>

490
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,440
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

491
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,640
<font color="yellow">It just breaks my heart...</font>

492
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,840
<font color="yellow">seeing you work so hard just to make a few bucks...</font>

493
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,710
<font color="yellow">with your belly that big.</font>

494
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,230
<font color="yellow">I'm just built this way.</font>

495
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,570
<font color="yellow">I could have 2, 3 kids like this.</font>

496
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,120
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

497
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,010
<font color="yellow">You remind me of a poster I saw while in school.</font>

498
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,560
<font color="yellow">If you have babies without thinking it through,</font>

499
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,070
<font color="yellow">you will end up being homeless.</font>

500
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,240
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am!
-  That's what the poster said.</font>

501
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,040
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. The MRI results are out.</font>

502
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,640
<font color="yellow">Where's your guardian?</font>

503
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,610
<font color="yellow">Don't be lame. What guardian?</font>

504
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,040
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

505
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,410
<font color="yellow">I'm my own guardian.</font>

506
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,320
<font color="yellow">Take a look at this.</font>

507
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,340
<font color="yellow">What school?</font>

508
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,470
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  What school did you graduate?</font>

509
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,310
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung?</font>

510
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,140
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

511
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,770
<font color="yellow">Was it at least in Seoul?</font>

512
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,170
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am.
-  Even when you eat fruit,</font>

513
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,870
<font color="yellow">you question its origin.</font>

514
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,210
<font color="yellow">Is it wrong to ask where my doctor went to school?</font>

515
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,910
<font color="yellow">Did I trigger your inferiority complex?</font>

516
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,610
<font color="yellow">- Let me explain.
-  Forget it.</font>

517
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,010
<font color="yellow">Get me another doctor.</font>

518
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,340
<font color="yellow">I'll tell my attending.</font>

519
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,640
<font color="yellow">If you're obvious about being poor,</font>

520
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,170
<font color="yellow">it makes people who have a lot like me uncomfortable.</font>

521
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,240
<font color="yellow">You make me feel like I did something wrong.</font>

522
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,070
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

523
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,770
<font color="yellow">Sure. I am terribly sorry...</font>

524
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,540
<font color="yellow">for being so obvious I grew up poor.</font>

525
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,110
<font color="yellow">- Doctor!
-  Oh my gosh.</font>

526
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,840
<font color="yellow">This is why I hate hospitals.</font>

527
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,070
<font color="yellow">It's hard to control the humidity.</font>

528
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,870
<font color="yellow">It's the absolute worst for my skin.</font>

529
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, no! Ma'am!</font>

530
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,070
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

531
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,210
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

532
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,610
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun!</font>

533
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,410
<font color="yellow">Please contact Neurosurgery.</font>

534
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,510
<font color="yellow">Isn't it nice?</font>

535
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,170
<font color="yellow">It's so refreshing.</font>

536
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,240
<font color="yellow">I invented it.</font>

537
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,640
<font color="yellow">How is this an invention?</font>

538
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,110
<font color="yellow">It's so nice and cool.</font>

539
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,240
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

540
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,110
<font color="yellow">That's cold! What is this?</font>

541
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,240
<font color="yellow">- Here.
-  What is this?</font>

542
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,570
<font color="yellow">Take care of your skin.</font>

543
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,170
<font color="yellow">Stop looking so poor.</font>

544
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,010
<font color="yellow">I almost socked it to her, but barely refrained myself.</font>

545
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,770
<font color="yellow">And what? Quit, start a business and go into debt?</font>

546
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,620
<font color="yellow">Who does she think she is?</font>

547
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,440
<font color="yellow">I asked every resource I have,</font>

548
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,710
<font color="yellow">and they all say different things.</font>

549
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,370
<font color="yellow">Some say she has the Blue House in her back pocket.</font>

550
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,010
<font color="yellow">Some say she's Chairman Kang's woman.</font>

551
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,840
<font color="yellow">There's a street called "Yoo Street" in Gangnam...</font>

552
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,840
<font color="yellow">because that street is filled with her buildings.</font>

553
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,170
<font color="yellow">Are you saying Kang Hyun Joon can't do anything either?</font>

554
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,310
<font color="yellow">- Of course.
-  That's right.</font>

555
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,140
<font color="yellow">She's powerful, well-connected and wealthy.</font>

556
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,650
<font color="yellow">She lacks only one thing.</font>

557
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,970
<font color="yellow">Respect for others.</font>

558
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,140
<font color="yellow">I know you're offended, but don't be too upset.</font>

559
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,740
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure we've all been there.
-  Really?</font>

560
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,150
<font color="yellow">Yes. You've been insulted, too.</font>

561
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,470
<font color="yellow">Someone said you were too tall and stupid-looking.</font>

562
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,070
<font color="yellow">Someone said they couldn't stand Dr Hwang's arrogance.</font>

563
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,140
<font color="yellow">- You are arrogant.
-  They were right.</font>

564
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,040
<font color="yellow">They say Dr Hyun is spineless and shouldn't be trusted.</font>

565
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,670
<font color="yellow">What about Dr Song?</font>

566
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,520
<font color="yellow">I don't have a story.</font>

567
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, you do!</font>

568
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,220
<font color="yellow">He has a big one.</font>

569
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,210
<font color="yellow">Remember the live surgery incident?</font>

570
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,510
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
-  Yes.</font>

571
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,310
<font color="yellow">Word about that spread like wildfire,</font>

572
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,240
<font color="yellow">so they won't even say his name.</font>

573
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,040
<font color="yellow">Are we making fun of ourselves...</font>

574
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,540
<font color="yellow">or that witch?</font>

575
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,080
<font color="yellow">We started making fun of that witch,</font>

576
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,170
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

577
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,770
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

578
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,240
<font color="yellow">so...</font>

579
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,440
<font color="yellow">who's the lucky doctor...</font>

580
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,400
<font color="yellow">who was chosen to treat Yoo Ok Kyung?</font>

581
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,400
<font color="yellow">I operated on her before for lung cancer.</font>

582
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,900
<font color="yellow">The targeted therapy...</font>

583
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,910
<font color="yellow">ended up forming a brain tumour.</font>

584
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,140
<font color="yellow">It isn't large,</font>

585
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,740
<font color="yellow">so I recommend gamma knife radiosurgery.</font>

586
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,350
<font color="yellow">She's become very weak...</font>

587
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,770
<font color="yellow">- and can't withstand invasive surgery.
-  No.</font>

588
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,040
<font color="yellow">I disagree,</font>

589
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,570
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun.</font>

590
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,670
<font color="yellow">This is incredible.</font>

591
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,240
<font color="yellow">The patient who hurts himself... I mean, Lee Sang Joon.</font>

592
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,700
<font color="yellow">The location of the tumour, the rate...</font>

593
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,540
<font color="yellow">and process in which the cancer spread are the same.</font>

594
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,670
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

595
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,150
<font color="yellow">She developed a tolerance for the targeted medicine...</font>

596
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,440
<font color="yellow">so we can't use chemotherapy...</font>

597
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,400
<font color="yellow">on her any more.</font>

598
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,340
<font color="yellow">Even that is the same.</font>

599
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,040
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say there is no treatment option?</font>

600
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,040
<font color="yellow">We can't operate and there's no suitable drug.</font>

601
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,800
<font color="yellow">Is metastasis and brain tumour a trend or something?</font>

602
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,670
<font color="yellow">I have a patient to see.</font>

603
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,640
<font color="yellow">Do you think there is no treatment available?</font>

604
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,440
<font color="yellow">Nothing legal.</font>

605
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,340
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

606
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,140
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you know.</font>

607
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,570
<font color="yellow">It'll be very pricey...</font>

608
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,700
<font color="yellow">and highly dangerous.</font>

609
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,800
<font color="yellow">And it is even illegal.</font>

610
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,600
<font color="yellow">Osimertinib.</font>

611
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,170
<font color="yellow">(Mutated epidermal growth factor receptor cancer drug)</font>

612
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,470
<font color="yellow">Is that what you mean?</font>

613
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,600
<font color="yellow">It's the most powerful and effective...</font>

614
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,270
<font color="yellow">and the only option.</font>

615
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,670
<font color="yellow">As her attending, I'm against it.</font>

616
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,670
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised.</font>

617
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,700
<font color="yellow">It is illegal to use osimertinib.</font>

618
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,700
<font color="yellow">We need to do a biopsy first.</font>

619
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,400
<font color="yellow">A biopsy of a brain tumour.</font>

620
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,600
<font color="yellow">There is a high risk of death...</font>

621
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,540
<font color="yellow">and a low rate of success. You know that.</font>

622
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,070
<font color="yellow">If we administer an illegal drug,</font>

623
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,270
<font color="yellow">the hospital will incur a huge financial loss.</font>

624
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,070
<font color="yellow">You know the reason...</font>

625
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,240
<font color="yellow">the drug is illegal is not because of...</font>

626
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,800
<font color="yellow">the effect of the drug or safety.</font>

627
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,170
<font color="yellow">It's because it is expensive.</font>

628
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,640
<font color="yellow">Because it creates a division of classes.</font>

629
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,870
<font color="yellow">Health must not discriminate between the rich and poor.</font>

630
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,410
<font color="yellow">Equality.</font>

631
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,920
<font color="yellow">That's a great sentiment.</font>

632
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,810
<font color="yellow">But why must only the sick...</font>

633
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,900
<font color="yellow">maintain that equality?</font>

634
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,740
<font color="yellow">In exchange for subsidising healthcare for the poor,</font>

635
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,650
<font color="yellow">certain treatments are forbidden.</font>

636
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,970
<font color="yellow">Society took the easy way out.</font>

637
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,850
<font color="yellow">The drug is out there,</font>

638
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,270
<font color="yellow">and money is not a problem,</font>

639
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,170
<font color="yellow">but it's illegal, so you must die.</font>

640
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,860
<font color="yellow">Do you call that legal?</font>

641
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,740
<font color="yellow">Must I obey that law?</font>

642
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,840
<font color="yellow">I'll say this as her attending physician.</font>

643
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,640
<font color="yellow">You may not give illegal treatment to my patient.</font>

644
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,470
<font color="yellow">And her neurosurgeon...</font>

645
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,670
<font color="yellow">will be changed from Dr Lee Young Oh...</font>

646
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,010
<font color="yellow">to Dr Oh Kyung Jin.</font>

647
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,240
<font color="yellow">You want me...</font>

648
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,110
<font color="yellow">to treat Yoo Ok Kyung?</font>

649
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,580
<font color="yellow">What about Dr Lee Young Oh?</font>

650
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,470
<font color="yellow">He is considering something dangerous.</font>

651
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,040
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to take her on.</font>

652
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,140
<font color="yellow">The administration of osimertinib?</font>

653
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,170
<font color="yellow">That probably...</font>

654
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,480
<font color="yellow">is the only option she has.</font>

655
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,400
<font color="yellow">It is illegal to give her that drug. You know that.</font>

656
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,400
<font color="yellow">- Dr Hyun.
-  The penalty for breaking the law...</font>

657
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,170
<font color="yellow">will fall on the hospital.</font>

658
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,670
<font color="yellow">If the hospital gets hurt with things like that,</font>

659
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,040
<font color="yellow">we'll have problems with the regenerative medicine.</font>

660
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,510
<font color="yellow">I'm against it.</font>

661
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,640
<font color="yellow">Is that how it works?</font>

662
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,480
<font color="yellow">There are plenty of legal options...</font>

663
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,100
<font color="yellow">for treating her.</font>

664
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,340
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

665
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,800
<font color="yellow">just how dangerous...</font>

666
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,840
<font color="yellow">a biopsy is, right?</font>

667
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,470
<font color="yellow">It's the best we can do.</font>

668
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

669
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,770
<font color="yellow">I'll take her.</font>

670
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,170
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

671
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,510
<font color="yellow">Do you live here?</font>

672
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,170
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask you something.</font>

673
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,600
<font color="yellow">What happens...</font>

674
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,870
<font color="yellow">if a patient wants treatment?</font>

675
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,370
<font color="yellow">Lee Sang Joon...</font>

676
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,250
<font color="yellow">wants to live.</font>

677
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,270
<font color="yellow">How do you know?</font>

678
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,740
<font color="yellow">How are you so sure?</font>

679
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,600
<font color="yellow">Lee Sang Joon...</font>

680
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,740
<font color="yellow">hasn't given up yet.</font>

681
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,370
<font color="yellow">It may be a piece of meaningless paper for others,</font>

682
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,170
<font color="yellow">but to me,</font>

683
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,970
<font color="yellow">it seems like he's still holding on to hope.</font>

684
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,840
<font color="yellow">We have different perspectives.</font>

685
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,170
<font color="yellow">Ordinary people...</font>

686
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,870
<font color="yellow">may consider this some sort of hope,</font>

687
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,440
<font color="yellow">but I...</font>

688
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,140
<font color="yellow">don't consider it as hope at all.</font>

689
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,510
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

690
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,540
<font color="yellow">If you aren't willing to help,</font>

691
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,700
<font color="yellow">I guess he has no chance.</font>

692
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,670
<font color="yellow">I never said it was impossible.</font>

693
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,070
<font color="yellow">What are you...</font>

694
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,770
<font color="yellow">There is an option...</font>

695
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,970
<font color="yellow">that is dangerous,</font>

696
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,170
<font color="yellow">illegal and highly costly.</font>

697
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

698
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

699
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,740
<font color="yellow">the detective in charge...</font>

700
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,440
<font color="yellow">needs to meet...</font>

701
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,870
<font color="yellow">the doctor in charge often. Are you aware of that?</font>

702
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

703
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,640
<font color="yellow">understand what I'm trying to say?</font>

704
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,840
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

705
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Are you all right?</font>

706
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,670
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I was out of it.</font>

707
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,400
<font color="yellow">Were you thinking about a guy?</font>

708
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,700
<font color="yellow">I'm joking.</font>

709
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,060
<font color="yellow">This is essential for a beautiful person...</font>

710
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,370
<font color="yellow">like you in the summer time, right?</font>

711
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,270
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

712
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,870
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

713
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,800
<font color="yellow">My objective is...</font>

714
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,970
<font color="yellow">to plead for a favourable settlement.</font>

715
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,820
<font color="yellow">You can't go to prison in this state.</font>

716
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,300
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

717
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,540
<font color="yellow">This is exactly what I wanted.</font>

718
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,340
<font color="yellow">We all...</font>

719
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,100
<font color="yellow">need help from others.</font>

720
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,770
<font color="yellow">It's not...</font>

721
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,800
<font color="yellow">shameful to ask someone for help.</font>

722
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,300
<font color="yellow">When you reach out for help,</font>

723
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,100
<font color="yellow">I believe someone will help you.</font>

724
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,100
<font color="yellow">That includes someone who's looking for a solution.</font>

725
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,340
<font color="yellow">The hope of ordinary people...</font>

726
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,170
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

727
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

728
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,700
<font color="yellow">How are you going to take responsibility?</font>

729
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,600
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard it is for me to fall back asleep?</font>

730
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,340
<font color="yellow">Get out now.</font>

731
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,170
<font color="yellow">Get ready for a disciplinary measure tomorrow morning.</font>

732
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,570
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

733
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,600
<font color="yellow">The tumour in your brain...</font>

734
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,100
<font color="yellow">will help you sleep for a long, long time.</font>

735
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,170
<font color="yellow">The tumour you have...</font>

736
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,170
<font color="yellow">makes surgery too risky...</font>

737
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,370
<font color="yellow">and drugs won't work,</font>

738
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,870
<font color="yellow">either.</font>

739
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,640
<font color="yellow">That's why there are people like you.</font>

740
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,600
<font color="yellow">That's what you get paid for.</font>

741
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

742
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,540
<font color="yellow">what must I do?</font>

743
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,700
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you can cure my tumour?</font>

744
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,570
<font color="yellow">Now, we're talking.</font>

745
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,700
<font color="yellow">Every doctor in this hospital is against the idea...</font>

746
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,500
<font color="yellow">because it is highly dangerous...</font>

747
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,640
<font color="yellow">and...</font>

748
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
<font color="yellow">illegal.</font>

749
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,570
<font color="yellow">And the most important factor is money.</font>

750
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,400
<font color="yellow">It is very costly.</font>

751
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,640
<font color="yellow">By illegal, do you mean I must break the law?</font>

752
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,160
<font color="yellow">Will I be punished?</font>

753
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,800
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

754
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,970
<font color="yellow">The hospital will take full responsibility.</font>

755
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,490
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang. Yoo Ok Kyung from Cardiothoracic Surgery...</font>

756
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,640
<font color="yellow">needs a biopsy.</font>

757
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,240
<font color="yellow">You're going to take her again?</font>

758
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,700
<font color="yellow">You're too nice. I don't even want to see her again.</font>

759
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,640
<font color="yellow">I took her as my patient on purpose.</font>

760
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,470
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I'll make the biopsy extra painful.</font>

761
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,770
<font color="yellow">I'll make her pay for what she said.</font>

762
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,960
<font color="yellow">Doctor, do you need my assistance?</font>

763
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,570
<font color="yellow">Sure. See you soon.</font>

764
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,170
<font color="yellow">You're dead now.</font>

765
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, Dr Lee?</font>

766
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,640
<font color="yellow">She's my patient.</font>

767
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,140
<font color="yellow">This is against the regulations.</font>

768
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,800
<font color="yellow">That's why I've been waiting for you.</font>

769
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you are well aware...</font>

770
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,370
<font color="yellow">that a biopsy is too risky for her.</font>

771
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,240
<font color="yellow">The location of the tumour isn't optimal.</font>

772
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,440
<font color="yellow">Legality, regulations, rules.</font>

773
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,940
<font color="yellow">Are they more important than a patient's life?</font>

774
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,370
<font color="yellow">I only think about probability.</font>

775
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,470
<font color="yellow">The probability...</font>

776
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,400
<font color="yellow">of the patient's survival.</font>

777
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
<font color="yellow">As long as...</font>

778
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
<font color="yellow">I'm here,</font>

779
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,640
<font color="yellow">you will never go in the OR with her.</font>

780
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,280
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang, call Ms Jang...</font>

781
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,600
<font color="yellow">and see if everything's ready.</font>

782
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,600
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for?</font>

783
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,940
<font color="yellow">Be quick. We're doing this right away.</font>

784
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,940
<font color="yellow">Should we begin, Dr Oh?</font>

785
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,470
<font color="yellow">Operator.</font>

786
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,570
<font color="yellow">Did you check the location of the tumour?</font>

787
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,600
<font color="yellow">I don't need you to coach me.</font>

788
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,840
<font color="yellow">This isn't a lab at a medical school.</font>

789
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,440
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

790
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,770
<font color="yellow">Ommaya reservoir is something...</font>

791
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,740
<font color="yellow">I've gone over hundreds of times in my head.</font>

792
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,740
<font color="yellow">My wife...</font>

793
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,940
<font color="yellow">passed away from the same thing.</font>

794
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,240
<font color="yellow">My choice back then was a biopsy.</font>

795
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,500
<font color="yellow">Even though the risk of dying from a biopsy is high,</font>

796
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,800
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

797
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,640
<font color="yellow">my wife would beat the odds.</font>

798
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,400
<font color="yellow">I had no idea...</font>

799
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,800
<font color="yellow">I'd be listening to your confession in an OR.</font>

800
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,370
<font color="yellow">Promotions were coming up,</font>

801
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,240
<font color="yellow">and I didn't dare violate a regulation...</font>

802
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,570
<font color="yellow">the hospital wouldn't approve of.</font>

803
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,670
<font color="yellow">It's ironic, isn't it?</font>

804
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,540
<font color="yellow">That regret is helping you save this patient.</font>

805
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,970
<font color="yellow">Injection.</font>

806
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,640
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

807
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,170
<font color="yellow">Check, please.</font>

808
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,570
<font color="yellow">How much is the penalty?</font>

809
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,470
<font color="yellow">Call Dr Lee Young Oh to my office.</font>

810
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,700
<font color="yellow">Put an oxygen mask on him.</font>

811
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,600
<font color="yellow">Sir, can you hear me?</font>

812
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,170
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

813
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,770
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

814
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,970
<font color="yellow">Does Patient Lee Sang Joon...</font>

815
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,140
<font color="yellow">have to pass away like this?</font>

816
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,000
<font color="yellow">Is that option...</font>

817
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,840
<font color="yellow">still possible?</font>

818
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,770
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

819
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,470
<font color="yellow">By my authority, I ban you from treating patients.</font>

820
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,170
<font color="yellow">I want to make it clear this time.</font>

821
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,460
<font color="yellow">Since you don't seem to understand,</font>

822
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,140
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you one more time. Listen!</font>

823
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,240
<font color="yellow">I need a doctor who helps me make money...</font>

824
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,770
<font color="yellow">more than one who treats diseases.</font>

825
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
<font color="yellow">Did I...</font>

826
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,140
<font color="yellow">make myself clear?</font>

827
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,440
<font color="yellow">If so,</font>

828
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,410
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

829
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,740
<font color="yellow">that Dr Lee Young Oh is the one you really need.</font>

830
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,750
<font color="yellow">You need to allow...</font>

831
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,900
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee to treat patients again.</font>

832
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,300
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

833
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,760
<font color="yellow">he can promise you a profit...</font>

834
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,040
<font color="yellow">that wasn't possible to make at Hyunsung...</font>

835
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,300
<font color="yellow">and that no one has every imagined.</font>

836
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,100
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

837
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,500
<font color="yellow">planning to make a donation to this hospital...</font>

838
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,700
<font color="yellow">under Dr Lee Young Oh's name...</font>

839
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,340
<font color="yellow">that's much more than the loss...</font>

840
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,340
<font color="yellow">caused by the incident.</font>

841
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,440
<font color="yellow">It seems that you'll have to allow me...</font>

842
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,900
<font color="yellow">to treat patients again. Don't you think so?</font>

843
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,940
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you understand what donation means?</font>

844
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,040
<font color="yellow">If you survive,</font>

845
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,270
<font color="yellow">would you be interested in having...</font>

846
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,110
<font color="yellow">what you haven't had before?</font>

847
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,600
<font color="yellow">Honour, hospitality, acclamation...</font>

848
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,440
<font color="yellow">and true respect.</font>

849
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,900
<font color="yellow">These are what you've been trying to get...</font>

850
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,010
<font color="yellow">but couldn't...</font>

851
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,640
<font color="yellow">while throwing harsh words to others.</font>

852
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,740
<font color="yellow">Of course, it'll cost you a fortune, though.</font>

853
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,440
<font color="yellow">The more it costs,</font>

854
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,740
<font color="yellow">the more valuable it must be.</font>

855
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,570
<font color="yellow">I like the idea.</font>

856
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,370
<font color="yellow">- Dr Yang.
-  Yes?</font>

857
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,910
<font color="yellow">How is the patient doing?</font>

858
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,900
<font color="yellow">I've given him emergency treatment.</font>

859
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,540
<font color="yellow">He refused treatment, didn't he?</font>

860
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
<font color="yellow">Are you sure...</font>

861
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,500
<font color="yellow">that you won't regret...</font>

862
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,900
<font color="yellow">giving up like this?</font>

863
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,170
<font color="yellow">I have said...</font>

864
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,440
<font color="yellow">all that I had to say.</font>

865
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:11,940
<font color="yellow">In my opinion,</font>

866
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,470
<font color="yellow">you don't have a high pain tolerance.</font>

867
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,170
<font color="yellow">People have different pain tolerances.</font>

868
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,900
<font color="yellow">But there's no shame in having a low pain tolerance.</font>

869
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,170
<font color="yellow">Even if you start treatment again,</font>

870
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,080
<font color="yellow">it'll only become even more painful.</font>

871
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,300
<font color="yellow">And your family,</font>

872
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,440
<font color="yellow">who you love and adore,</font>

873
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,240
<font color="yellow">will suffer even more.</font>

874
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,000
<font color="yellow">Even if you get really lucky...</font>

875
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,470
<font color="yellow">and have surgery,</font>

876
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:48,400
<font color="yellow">there will be something more important than that.</font>

877
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,530
<font color="yellow">It's to desperately seek to survive...</font>

878
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,100
<font color="yellow">with your own will.</font>

879
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,970
<font color="yellow">Are you sure...</font>

880
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,440
<font color="yellow">that you have given up on this reality?</font>

881
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,300
<font color="yellow">I'll take that as a yes.</font>

882
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,570
<font color="yellow">I want to live.</font>

883
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,440
<font color="yellow">Is this what you wanted to hear?</font>

884
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,300
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask me that?</font>

885
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,770
<font color="yellow">From the beginning,</font>

886
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,700
<font color="yellow">I had no choice.</font>

887
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,700
<font color="yellow">I couldn't afford the treatment.</font>

888
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,670
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

889
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,700
<font color="yellow">I want to live.</font>

890
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,270
<font color="yellow">Whatever it costs,</font>

891
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,740
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

892
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,970
<font color="yellow">to live.</font>

893
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:32,970
<font color="yellow">We found a benefactor.</font>

894
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:47,970
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

895
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,070
<font color="yellow">I'm here as the detective in charge...</font>

896
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,670
<font color="yellow">to report to the doctor in charge.</font>

897
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,770
<font color="yellow">Come on in and report to me properly.</font>

898
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,750
<font color="yellow">He's a first-time offender...</font>

899
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,560
<font color="yellow">and his predicament was taken into consideration.</font>

900
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,040
<font color="yellow">We were able to get a settlement,</font>

901
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,140
<font color="yellow">so he won't have to go to prison.</font>

902
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

903
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:22,670
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to you.</font>

904
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,390
<font color="yellow">He said that...</font>

905
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,400
<font color="yellow">meeting you was like winning the lottery.</font>

906
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,000
<font color="yellow">Keep it just in case.</font>

907
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,950
<font color="yellow">Call me if you win it.</font>

908
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,400
<font color="yellow">You know we should split it evenly, right?</font>

909
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,170
<font color="yellow">Do you really think...</font>

910
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,470
<font color="yellow">that this can give hope...</font>

911
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,700
<font color="yellow">to normal people?</font>

912
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,640
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

913
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,840
<font color="yellow">think that way, too?</font>

914
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,970
<font color="yellow">That this can give hope?</font>

915
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,640
<font color="yellow">Such a trivial thing like this?</font>

916
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,900
<font color="yellow">Anticipating that tomorrow will be different.</font>

917
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,970
<font color="yellow">To me, that's what hope is.</font>

918
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,400
<font color="yellow">In that sense,</font>

919
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,470
<font color="yellow">you're the most hopeful person I know.</font>

920
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:38,340
<font color="yellow">You show me a different side to you whenever I see you.</font>

921
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,670
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

922
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,800
<font color="yellow">Don't forget...</font>

923
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,300
<font color="yellow">to call me if you win the lottery.</font>

924
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,440
<font color="yellow">You have to.</font>

925
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,140
<font color="yellow">"Don't forget to call me."</font>

926
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,370
<font color="yellow">"You have to call me..."</font>

927
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,870
<font color="yellow">"if you win the lottery."</font>

928
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,400
<font color="yellow">You're the most hopeful person I know.</font>

929
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,770
<font color="yellow">You show me...</font>

930
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,500
<font color="yellow">a different side to you whenever I see you.</font>

931
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,640
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

932
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,170
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

933
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,840
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Dr Lee.</font>

934
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,870
<font color="yellow">I can't feel anything.</font>

935
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,270
<font color="yellow">Nothing at all.</font>

936
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,770
<font color="yellow">You were wrong.</font>

937
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,640
<font color="yellow">Just as I thought,</font>

938
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:26,970
<font color="yellow">I can't change.</font>

939
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,340
<font color="yellow">I'll call you...</font>

940
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,100
<font color="yellow">if I win the lottery.</font>

941
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,670
<font color="yellow">That's Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

942
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,700
<font color="yellow">He is the son of Dr Lee Gun Myung.</font>

943

<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

945
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,270
<font color="yellow">To me, he always seems dangerous.</font>

948
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,340
<font color="yellow">what will happen?</font>

<font color="yellow">How?</font>
