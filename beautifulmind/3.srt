00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, I assumed she was anaemic...</font>

160
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,640
<font color="yellow">since she's still growing.</font>

161
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my daughter's body?</font>

162
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,470
<font color="yellow">Honey, did you know about this?</font>

163
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,800
<font color="yellow">You're with her 24 hours a day.</font>

164
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,830
<font color="yellow">She doesn't like spending time with me...</font>

165
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,770
<font color="yellow">and tells me that she's grown up now.</font>

166
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,020
<font color="yellow">Were there any reports...</font>

167
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,020
<font color="yellow">of her getting bullied at school?</font>

168
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,040
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

169
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,810
<font color="yellow">She's kind-hearted.</font>

170
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,030
<font color="yellow">She's nice to everyone.</font>

171
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,230
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, they're the ones who usually get bullied.</font>

172
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,440
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

173
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,360
<font color="yellow">The tryouts...</font>

174
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,210
<font color="yellow">for the Youth Soccer Team is coming up soon.</font>

175
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,210
<font color="yellow">Min Kyung spends all of her time...</font>

176
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,900
<font color="yellow">practising with her dad.</font>

177
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,470
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even go to school.</font>

178
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,770
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

179
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,940
<font color="yellow">Are you suspecting me...</font>

180
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,800
<font color="yellow">of hitting my daughter?</font>

181
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,490
<font color="yellow">Min Kyung is my daughter.</font>

182
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,000
<font color="yellow">She's my one and only girl.</font>

183
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,970
<font color="yellow">I can give up my life...</font>

184
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,820
<font color="yellow">for her.</font>

185
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,540
<font color="yellow">Why? Why would I do such a thing?</font>

186
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,100
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

187
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,710
<font color="yellow">- Of course.
-  Yes.</font>

188
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,150
<font color="yellow">He's a good father and husband.</font>

189
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,870
<font color="yellow">I'm asking if he's the patient's biological father.</font>

190
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,400
<font color="yellow">Are you accusing me...</font>

191
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,170
<font color="yellow">of abusing her...</font>

192
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,070
<font color="yellow">because I'm not her biological father?</font>

193
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,590
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm responsible for her condition?</font>

194
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,100
<font color="yellow">In most cases, child abuse...</font>

195
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,870
<font color="yellow">is committed by biological parents.</font>

196
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,560
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm curious about.</font>

197
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,720
<font color="yellow">Please hold.</font>

198
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,740
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, the OR is ready.</font>

199
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,500
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you once again.</font>

200
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,300
<font color="yellow">Are you really the biological father of the patient?</font>

201
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

202
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,240
<font color="yellow">She's my own daughter.</font>

203
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,370
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

204
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,770
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second, please.</font>

205
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,970
<font color="yellow">Orthopaedics is also looking for an OR.</font>

206
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,840
<font color="yellow">- Please tell them that we don't need it.
-  What?</font>

207
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,380
<font color="yellow">- Hold on!
-  Dr Lee.</font>

208
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,600
<font color="yellow">You said earlier that Min Kyung...</font>

209
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,100
<font color="yellow">needs to be operated on within an hour.</font>

210
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,580
<font color="yellow">If we operate on her now,</font>

211
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,280
<font color="yellow">she'll face a table death from excessive blood loss.</font>

212
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,530
<font color="yellow">(Table death: Death during operation)</font>

213
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,540
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,180
<font color="yellow">Blood is being congested without external shock.</font>

215
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,100
<font color="yellow">There are signs of internal bleeding around the joints.</font>

216
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,930
<font color="yellow">Her consciousness is fading at a rapid rate.</font>

217
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,540
<font color="yellow">On top of that, both of you are lying.</font>

218
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,690
<font color="yellow">If I'm correct,</font>

219
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,120
<font color="yellow">she is suffering from intracerebral haemorrhage...</font>

220
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,370
<font color="yellow">caused by haemophilia.</font>

221
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,840
<font color="yellow">Only specialised medication and surgery...</font>

222
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,120
<font color="yellow">can halt the excessive bleeding.</font>

223
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,430
<font color="yellow">That's why we are urgently asking for surgery.</font>

224
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,770
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

225
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,300
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the money?</font>

226
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,370
<font color="yellow">Haemophilia.</font>

227
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,070
<font color="yellow">Haemophilia is...</font>

228
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,300
<font color="yellow">hereditary.</font>

229
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,120
<font color="yellow">It's uncommon, but if a child suffers from haemophilia,</font>

230
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,740
<font color="yellow">either the mother...</font>

231
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,260
<font color="yellow">or the father...</font>

232
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,700
<font color="yellow">should also be a haemophilic patient.</font>

233
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,140
<font color="yellow">You can see what that's like.</font>

234
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,670
<font color="yellow">Here's my conclusion.</font>

235
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,080
<font color="yellow">If you were suffering from haemophilia,</font>

236
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,250
<font color="yellow">you would have never made the national team.</font>

237
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,500
<font color="yellow">Let's verify the information.</font>

238
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,340
<font color="yellow">I'll ask one last time.</font>

239
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,500
<font color="yellow">Is he really the biological father...</font>

240
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,570
<font color="yellow">of the patient?</font>

241
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,780
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering?</font>

242
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,950
<font color="yellow">She's my daughter.</font>

243
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,270
<font color="yellow">Go on, tell the doctor.</font>

244
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,140
<font color="yellow">Min Kyung is my daughter.</font>

245
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,190
<font color="yellow">She's my one and only child.</font>

246
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,200
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,580
<font color="yellow">- Dr Yang.
-  Yes?</font>

248
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,930
<font color="yellow">Please ready the patient for a transfer.</font>

249
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

250
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,900
<font color="yellow">The surgery...</font>

251
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,370
<font color="yellow">Please proceed with the surgery.</font>

252
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,370
<font color="yellow">Please save...</font>

253
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,700
<font color="yellow">Min Kyung.</font>

254
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,470
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
<font color="yellow">Bipolar.</font>

256
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,700
<font color="yellow">Retractor.</font>

257
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,370
<font color="yellow">You were amazing, Dr Lee.</font>

258
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,070
<font color="yellow">There aren't many surgeons...</font>

259
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,670
<font color="yellow">who are capable of operating on haemophilia patients.</font>

260
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,600
<font color="yellow">An accurate diagnosis followed by a perfect surgery.</font>

261
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,970
<font color="yellow">You think you're a good doctor, don't you?</font>

262
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
<font color="yellow">Will you still be considered a good doctor...</font>

263
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,770
<font color="yellow">once she wakes and looks for her father?</font>

264
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,640
<font color="yellow">Your opinion seems to be a predetermined "no".</font>

265
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,770
<font color="yellow">Did you really have to go that far?</font>

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,370
<font color="yellow">An haemophilia exam could've been carried out.</font>

267
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,140
<font color="yellow">Should I have waited two weeks for the results...</font>

268
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
<font color="yellow">before operating on her?</font>

269
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,100
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you were too cruel?</font>

270
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
<font color="yellow">Min Kyung.</font>

271
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
<font color="yellow">It's Mum.</font>

272
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,140
<font color="yellow">You are a good girl.</font>

273
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,600
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

274
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,340
<font color="yellow">very much.</font>

275
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,740
<font color="yellow">Dad?</font>

276
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,240
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see Dad?</font>

277
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,800
<font color="yellow">Don't be a crybaby and get better soon.</font>

278
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,200
<font color="yellow">Look how weak you are.</font>

279
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,700
<font color="yellow">How will you become a national team player?</font>

280
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,140
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight, okay?</font>

281
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,100
<font color="yellow">Let's just consider...</font>

282
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,100
<font color="yellow">all of this...</font>

283
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,740
<font color="yellow">as a nightmare.</font>

284
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,770
<font color="yellow">I'm not the one who lied to him...</font>

285
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,600
<font color="yellow">and made him raise a kid that was not his.</font>

286
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,570
<font color="yellow">"I will do anything and everything for my child."</font>

287
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,340
<font color="yellow">I'm not the one who made...</font>

288
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,100
<font color="yellow">such a grandiloquent statement.</font>

289
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

290
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,910
<font color="yellow">I'm also not the doctor...</font>

291
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,900
<font color="yellow">who almost misdiagnosed a patient...</font>

292
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
<font color="yellow">with CT results alone.</font>

293
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,200
<font color="yellow">The surgery is over, and the child lives.</font>

294
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,370
<font color="yellow">Do you really think...</font>

295
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,370
<font color="yellow">I'm cruel?</font>

296
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,240
<font color="yellow">Is Dr Hyun...</font>

297
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,950
<font color="yellow">still in surgery?</font>

298
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,390
<font color="yellow">Yes, it involved a aortic dissection,</font>

299
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,070
<font color="yellow">so it's still ongoing since yesterday.</font>

300
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,940
<font color="yellow">It'll take over 12 hours.</font>

301
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,570
<font color="yellow">Leave the message with me.</font>

302
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,340
<font color="yellow">I'll pass it on.</font>

303
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,170
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

304
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,770
<font color="yellow">has the table death murder suspect been caught yet?</font>

305
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,910
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee is no longer a suspect.</font>

306
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for Dr Hyun anyway?</font>

307
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,060
<font color="yellow">It's a personal matter.</font>

308
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,410
<font color="yellow">I have something to discuss with him.</font>

309
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,870
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

310
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,270
<font color="yellow">Dr Nam, you said it was Dr Hyun, right?</font>

311
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,800
<font color="yellow">The person looking for Kang Chul Min's...</font>

312
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,670
<font color="yellow">surgery footage before that officer...</font>

313
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,310
<font color="yellow">was Dr Hyun, right?</font>

314
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,340
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

315
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
<font color="yellow">For instance,</font>

316
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,140
<font color="yellow">a heart may be missing.</font>

317
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,290
<font color="yellow">As expected,</font>

318
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,000
<font color="yellow">I wasn't the only one that visited the morgue.</font>

319
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,770
<font color="yellow">Because you, Dr Hyun Suk Joo, were there as well.</font>

320
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,540
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee was the only person...</font>

321
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,040
<font color="yellow">who was captured in the morgue security footage.</font>

322
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,140
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun.</font>

323
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,690
<font color="yellow">Thank you. There's wasn't much to see.</font>

324
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,990
<font color="yellow">That's what I said.</font>

325
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,540
<font color="yellow">It's the same boring footage.</font>

326
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,600
<font color="yellow">Why did they make such a fuss about deleting it?</font>

327
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's because they don't want the exposure.</font>

328
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,030
<font color="yellow">Did the cardiothoracic surgeon ask personally?</font>

329
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,270
<font color="yellow">No. That's always handled by the secretaries...</font>

330
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,540
<font color="yellow">So they did make the request...</font>

331
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,300
<font color="yellow">to delete Dr Hyun's footage.</font>

332
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,020
<font color="yellow">(Surgery Board)</font>

333
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,040
<font color="yellow">(Dr Hyun Suk Joo: Complete)</font>

334
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,700
<font color="yellow">The operation took over 12 hours.</font>

335
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,840
<font color="yellow">Witness statements are crucial for the investigation.</font>

336
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,700
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun isn't a flight risk.</font>

337
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,440
<font color="yellow">He isn't likely to destroy the evidence either.</font>

338
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,700
<font color="yellow">The heart is missing.</font>

339
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,870
<font color="yellow">The heart.</font>

340
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,410
<font color="yellow">We'll find out soon...</font>

341
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,040
<font color="yellow">what really happened.</font>

342
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,410
<font color="yellow">We'll uncover who really took the heart.</font>

343
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,540
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun...</font>

344
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,040
<font color="yellow">would never lie to me.</font>

345
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,370
<font color="yellow">All human beings...</font>

346
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,000
<font color="yellow">lie without exception.</font>

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,070
<font color="yellow">Even when their child faces a life-or-death situation,</font>

348
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,770
<font color="yellow">people lie until the very moment they're caught.</font>

349
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,370
<font color="yellow">It's what humans do.</font>

350
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,570
<font color="yellow">Like you, now.</font>

351
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,300
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung Insurance.</font>

352
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,200
<font color="yellow">What's the price of the stock?</font>

353
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,080
<font color="yellow">It's at 98 dollars a share.</font>

354
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,450
<font color="yellow">It's fallen quite a bit.</font>

355
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,270
<font color="yellow">My father will summon my brother...</font>

356
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,260
<font color="yellow">and show him some fatherly love.</font>

357
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,000
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, a swift kick as well.</font>

358
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,970
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Dr Lee. What a brilliant performance.</font>

359
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,700
<font color="yellow">You rescued a little girl from haemophilia.</font>

360
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,700
<font color="yellow">Not many Korean surgeons are capable enough to do that.</font>

361
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,880
<font color="yellow">That's right, Sir.</font>

362
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,340
<font color="yellow">That's a shame that doctors can't do their jobs.</font>

363
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,480
<font color="yellow">With the current cost of insurance,</font>

364
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,460
<font color="yellow">diagnosing and treating patients...</font>

365
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,440
<font color="yellow">with such rare and incurable diseases...</font>

366
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,470
<font color="yellow">will thoroughly hurt any hospital's profit.</font>

367
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,570
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

368
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,000
<font color="yellow">Then it's not a matter of skill.</font>

369
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,640
<font color="yellow">Brilliant doctors are refusing to operate...</font>

370
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,060
<font color="yellow">because it hurts profits...</font>

371
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,370
<font color="yellow">unlike our great Dr Lee here.</font>

372
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,670
<font color="yellow">I won't hold you responsible this time.</font>

373
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,430
<font color="yellow">You learned to prioritise the budget, operate...</font>

374
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,740
<font color="yellow">and know what it is to be the head of the centre.</font>

375
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,220
<font color="yellow">Let's consider this...</font>

376
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,900
<font color="yellow">an expensive private lesson from my pockets.</font>

377
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,100
<font color="yellow">I didn't know...</font>

378
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,500
<font color="yellow">that you were trying to profit from a hospital.</font>

379
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,000
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason why Hyunsung Medical Centre,</font>

380
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,740
<font color="yellow">a hospital unfit for the nation's public insurance,</font>

381
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,400
<font color="yellow">was passed unto such an ambitious person...</font>

382
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
<font color="yellow">such as yourself.</font>

383
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,040
<font color="yellow">You need a hospital with specialised care...</font>

384
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,940
<font color="yellow">for yourself or a family member...</font>

385
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,160
<font color="yellow">who might become afflicted with an incurable disease.</font>

386
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,370
<font color="yellow">The institution must match...</font>

387
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,370
<font color="yellow">your wealth and power with thorough service.</font>

388
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,470
<font color="yellow">You need private health insurance...</font>

389
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
<font color="yellow">that caters to the highest class.</font>

390
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,570
<font color="yellow">To give an example,</font>

391
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung Insurance.</font>

392
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
<font color="yellow">Mr Chae,</font>

393
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,000
<font color="yellow">did he just read my mind?</font>

394
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,570
<font color="yellow">Did he just figure out why...</font>

395
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,550
<font color="yellow">a black sheep like me stands among white-robed angels?</font>

396
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,070
<font color="yellow">I am not interested in the affairs of a princely heir.</font>

397
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,700
<font color="yellow">However, I know why someone like you...</font>

398
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,270
<font color="yellow">would need me.</font>

399
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,240
<font color="yellow">Advertising balloons...</font>

400
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,300
<font color="yellow">lure people in with elaborate catchphrases.</font>

401
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,680
<font color="yellow">You need to assure wealthy clients...</font>

402
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,260
<font color="yellow">that top-notch service and care...</font>

403
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,670
<font color="yellow">can be found at Hyunsung Medical Centre.</font>

404
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,400
<font color="yellow">I, Lee Young Oh,</font>

405
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,470
<font color="yellow">plan to float very high up.</font>

406
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,770
<font color="yellow">High enough that no one would dare bring me down.</font>

407
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
<font color="yellow">Someone told me...</font>

408
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,670
<font color="yellow">that you are like a pretty knife.</font>

409
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,140
<font color="yellow">You seem attractive, but you can be very harmful.</font>

410
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
<font color="yellow">Indeed, I am a brat that my family abandoned.</font>

411
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,170
<font color="yellow">Let this brat grab that knife and do a sword dance.</font>

412
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,500
<font color="yellow">Is that why you needed...</font>

413
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,700
<font color="yellow">to become the head of the centre?</font>

414
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,680
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be recognised...</font>

415
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,020
<font color="yellow">as the doctor everyone looks up to in front of me?</font>

416
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,440
<font color="yellow">It's because you don't deserve the title,</font>

417
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,900
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

418
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,500
<font color="yellow">A corpse had been switched,</font>

419
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,300
<font color="yellow">and the corpse's heart went missing.</font>

420
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,540
<font color="yellow">But you didn't even look into it.</font>

421
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

422
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,340
<font color="yellow">You seem more righteous than anyone else.</font>

423
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,000
<font color="yellow">You seem to be fair and impartial.</font>

424
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,340
<font color="yellow">But in your heart,</font>

425
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,600
<font color="yellow">all you did was suspect your own son.</font>

426
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,870
<font color="yellow">You were afraid it was me.</font>

427
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,600
<font color="yellow">You were in fear.</font>

428
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,640
<font color="yellow">- That was...
-  Tilted chin.</font>

429
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
<font color="yellow">Puzzled.</font>

430
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,440
<font color="yellow">Moving Adam's apple.</font>

431
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,470
<font color="yellow">A silent affirmation.</font>

432
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,840
<font color="yellow">Your mouth may lie,</font>

433
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,500
<font color="yellow">but your body...</font>

434
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,470
<font color="yellow">cannot.</font>

435
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

436
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,770
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

437
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,600
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

438
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,540
<font color="yellow">What is she doing?</font>

439
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,870
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  What's wrong with her?</font>

440
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,670
<font color="yellow">There it is.</font>

441
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,740
<font color="yellow">You're buying drinks tonight.</font>

442
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

443
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,140
<font color="yellow">Come on, give it to me.</font>

444
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,740
<font color="yellow">I bought you the drinks.</font>

445
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
<font color="yellow">One more bottle of soju, please.</font>

446
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,740
<font color="yellow">Someone who can drink alone...</font>

447
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,140
<font color="yellow">has nothing to fear...</font>

448
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,700
<font color="yellow">because that person has figured out the secret to life.</font>

449
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,140
<font color="yellow">They've figured out that you're alone in this world...</font>

450
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,700
<font color="yellow">and that life is bitter.</font>

451
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, wise one.</font>

452
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,240
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

453
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,240
<font color="yellow">What gave you courage...</font>

454
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
<font color="yellow">back then?</font>

455
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,240
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Suk Joo?</font>

456
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,370
<font color="yellow">Why are you hesitating?</font>

457
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,600
<font color="yellow">Just go and tell him.</font>

458
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin.</font>

459
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,270
<font color="yellow">Did you know?</font>

460
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,270
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

461
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,940
<font color="yellow">How can you call yourself a brave police officer?</font>

462
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,270
<font color="yellow">"Dr Hyun Suk Joo,"</font>

463
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,870
<font color="yellow">"I like you."</font>

464
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,140
<font color="yellow">"Do you like me?"</font>

465
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,670
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

466
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,040
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

467
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,970
<font color="yellow">You can't fool me.</font>

468
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,070
<font color="yellow">I know you inside and out.</font>

469
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,490
<font color="yellow">Don't even try.</font>

470
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,060

630
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,840
<font color="yellow">Removed blood clot, a source of pressure on the brain.</font>

631
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,370
<font color="yellow">It was to prevent potential infarction and edema.</font>

632
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,400
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

633
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,340
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

634
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,870
<font color="yellow">I was not wrong.</font>

635
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,770
<font color="yellow">My surgery...</font>

636
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,100
<font color="yellow">was not a failure.</font>

637
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,020
<font color="yellow">I was not wrong.</font>

638
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,470
<font color="yellow">How could you say that right now?</font>

639
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,140
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin passed away.</font>

640
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,700
<font color="yellow">How could you say that...</font>

641
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,600
<font color="yellow">in front his family who trusted you?</font>

642
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,670
<font color="yellow">You're the lead surgeon.</font>

643
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,400
<font color="yellow">Aren't you the lead surgeon? That's not right!</font>

644
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,740
<font color="yellow">Aren't you...</font>

645
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,440
<font color="yellow">As the lead surgeon,</font>

646
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,070
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you the surgery was perfect.</font>

647
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,340
<font color="yellow">My surgery was perfect.</font>

648
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,020
<font color="yellow">My surgery was perfect!</font>

649
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,040
<font color="yellow">Young Oh!</font>

650
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
<font color="yellow">Let's hear...</font>

651
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,230
<font color="yellow">the rest of that at the mortality conference.</font>

652
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,430
<font color="yellow">(Mortality Conference: doctors discuss cause of death)</font>

653
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,100
<font color="yellow">That is still my right as the head of the centre.</font>

654
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,940
<font color="yellow">I apologise...</font>

655
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,270
<font color="yellow">for my son's mistake.</font>

656
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,270
<font color="yellow">No words can express...
-  Dong Jae...</font>

657
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,310
<font color="yellow">the loss we feel.</font>

658
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,000
<font color="yellow">I was so worried.</font>

659
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,700
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

660
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

661
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,240
<font color="yellow">Talk to me. I can comfort you.</font>

662
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,270
<font color="yellow">Comfort?</font>

663
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:23,970
<font color="yellow">Comfort.</font>

664
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,440
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's possible?</font>

665
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,500
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

666
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,770
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

667
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,670
<font color="yellow">Are you sure...</font>

668
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,120
<font color="yellow">you're okay?</font>

669
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,240
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

670
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,070
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

671
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,740
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

672
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,100
<font color="yellow">very fine.</font>

673
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you think...</font>

674
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,100
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh is a bit off?</font>

675
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,570
<font color="yellow">At first, I thought,</font>

676
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,870
<font color="yellow">"Here's another arrogant jerk."</font>

677
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,870
<font color="yellow">But in front of the OR,</font>

678
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,540
<font color="yellow">he looked like he was alone in this world.</font>

679
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,540
<font color="yellow">The more I see him,</font>

680
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
<font color="yellow">the more different he seems.</font>

681
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,200
<font color="yellow">Even a talented person gets scared.</font>

682
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,600
<font color="yellow">The director died on his operating table.</font>

683
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,480
<font color="yellow">And he was his father's best friend of 40 years.</font>

684
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,500
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

685
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,840
<font color="yellow">He was the nicest man in the world.</font>

686
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,170
<font color="yellow">He was so nice.</font>

687
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,370
<font color="yellow">He seemed like a soft old man,</font>

688
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,200
<font color="yellow">but I got hit a lot when I was a student.</font>

689
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,940
<font color="yellow">We all feel lousy, so I'll buy. Hold on.</font>

690
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
<font color="yellow">Drink.</font>

691
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,300
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into him?</font>

692
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,050
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

693
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,500
<font color="yellow">- Here.
-  What is that?</font>

694
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,940
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

695
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,140
<font color="yellow">You need to give us this before you order.</font>

696
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,740
<font color="yellow">The menu is different.</font>

697
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,040
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm giving it to you now,</font>

698
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,400
<font color="yellow">in case you give us nasty food.</font>

699
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,900
<font color="yellow">Come on now. Treat us on a night like this.</font>

700
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,300
<font color="yellow">This won't help you buy a building.</font>

701
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,570
<font color="yellow">Don't bother.</font>

702
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,360
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

703
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,780
<font color="yellow">I really can't stand...</font>

704
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,640
<font color="yellow">being a surgeon on a day like this.</font>

705
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,510
<font color="yellow">Something is very strange.</font>

706
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,540
<font color="yellow">It shouldn't have been a table death.</font>

707
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,700
<font color="yellow">What happened to the director?</font>

708
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,170
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

709
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,340
<font color="yellow">Someone who can drink alone...</font>

710
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,800
<font color="yellow">has nothing to fear...</font>

711
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,000
<font color="yellow">because that person has figured out the secret to life.</font>

712
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,170
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

713
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,700
<font color="yellow">They've figured out that you're alone in this world...</font>

714
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,540
<font color="yellow">and that life is bitter.</font>

715
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

716
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,600
<font color="yellow">The funeral has begun.</font>

717
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,920
<font color="yellow">Let's go and say goodbye.</font>

718
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,070
<font color="yellow">I can't go there.</font>

719
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,170
<font color="yellow">I won't go.</font>

720
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,270
<font color="yellow">Jin Sung.</font>

721
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,100
<font color="yellow">He died because of me.</font>

722
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,840
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

723
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,300
<font color="yellow">I told him everything.</font>

724
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,600
<font color="yellow">I told him Patient Kang Chul Min's heart was removed,</font>

725
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,140
<font color="yellow">and that you visited the morgue.</font>

726
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:55,770
<font color="yellow">I believe...</font>

727
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,440
<font color="yellow">that someone in this hospital killed him.</font>

728
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,670
<font color="yellow">Last night,</font>

729
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,300
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin came to the hospital to confirm that.</font>

730
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,170
<font color="yellow">And he died.</font>

731
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,540
<font color="yellow">I asked the National Health Insurance Corporation...</font>

732
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,260
<font color="yellow">to fax the original copy of...</font>

733
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,600
<font color="yellow">Patient Kang Chul Min's medical record.</font>

734
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,570
<font color="yellow">I think the person...</font>

735
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,100
<font color="yellow">who killed Patient Kang Chul Min...</font>

736
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,340
<font color="yellow">did the same thing to Mr Shin.</font>

737
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,120
<font color="yellow">This can't be true.</font>

738
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,300
<font color="yellow">Patient Kang Chul Min...</font>

739
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,270
<font color="yellow">had never been treated in this hospital.</font>

740
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,700
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung has nothing to do with that patient.</font>

741
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,040
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can trust you?</font>

742
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,990
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me the truth?</font>

743
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,260
<font color="yellow">He was my patient...</font>

744
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,670
<font color="yellow">and I was afraid.</font>

745
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,300
<font color="yellow">I didn't want you to see me that way.</font>

746
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,700
<font color="yellow">Jin Sung.</font>

747
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,710
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take a break?</font>

748
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,500
<font color="yellow">Let me look into this.</font>

749
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,670
<font color="yellow">Even though you don't trust me,</font>

750
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,640
<font color="yellow">I still care about you.</font>

751
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,840
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

752
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,970
<font color="yellow">I will do this.</font>

753
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,370
<font color="yellow">I will pay my respects to Mr Shin later.</font>

754
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,170
<font color="yellow">I don't deserve to cry over his death yet.</font>

755
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,700
<font color="yellow">I'll fight on your behalf.</font>

756
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,540
<font color="yellow">The hospital won't charge her for her surgery.</font>

757
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,500
<font color="yellow">If that doesn't work, I'll deduct it from my pay.</font>

758
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,340
<font color="yellow">Young lady.</font>

759
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,540
<font color="yellow">I know you're hiding under the stairs.</font>

760
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,170
<font color="yellow">Professor!</font>

761
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,070
<font color="yellow">Jin Sung.</font>

762
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,840
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

763
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,440
<font color="yellow">I hope it's not too late...</font>

764
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,300
<font color="yellow">to tell you...</font>

765
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,770
<font color="yellow">that you can trust people in this world.</font>

766
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,540
<font color="yellow">Can you give me a chance...</font>

767
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,440
<font color="yellow">to prove it to you?</font>

768
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,270
<font color="yellow">When I'm done,</font>

769
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,200
<font color="yellow">shall we have a drink together again?</font>

770
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
<font color="yellow">Cottonoid.</font>

771
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,770
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

772
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,340
<font color="yellow">He's in cardiac arrest.</font>

773
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

774
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,940
<font color="yellow">The bleeding won't stop.</font>

775
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,900
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, I can't stabilise his blood pressure.</font>

776
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,540
<font color="yellow">Administer the antihypertensive,</font>

777
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,100
<font color="yellow">and I need two more bags of blood.</font>

778
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,600
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

779
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,170
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about...</font>

780
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,340
<font color="yellow">why you came back.</font>

781
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,540
<font color="yellow">I want you to apologise...</font>

782
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,470
<font color="yellow">to the patient's family for what you did today.</font>

783
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,340
<font color="yellow">If I apologise to them,</font>

784
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,380
<font color="yellow">would it bring him back?</font>

785
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,560
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't bring him back,</font>

786
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,840
<font color="yellow">but it would console them.</font>

787
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,240
<font color="yellow">Normal people...</font>

788
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,670
<font color="yellow">call this a sense of responsibility.</font>

789
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,370
<font color="yellow">Normal people.</font>

790
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,700
<font color="yellow">So a sense of responsibility...</font>

791
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,800
<font color="yellow">is just like a collective punishment.</font>

792
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,430
<font color="yellow">It's like being punished...</font>

793
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,900
<font color="yellow">when you've done nothing wrong.</font>

794
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,180
<font color="yellow">That's not fun.</font>

795
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,200
<font color="yellow">You showed too much of yourself today.</font>

796
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,670
<font color="yellow">You don't have a guilty conscience,</font>

797
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,600
<font color="yellow">sympathy...</font>

798
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,940
<font color="yellow">or a sense of responsibility.</font>

799
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,340
<font color="yellow">You don't feel anything...</font>

800
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,340
<font color="yellow">when you see a patient suffering.</font>

801
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,900
<font color="yellow">You showed your true face.</font>

802
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,270
<font color="yellow">You had better apologise to them...</font>

803
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,170
<font color="yellow">if you want to hide your true self.</font>

804
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,370
<font color="yellow">It was a buy one, get one free deal.</font>

805
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,800
<font color="yellow">You're a piece of work.</font>

806
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,740
<font color="yellow">When you drive a car,</font>

807
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,990
<font color="yellow">you just have to keep an eye on traffic signs.</font>

808
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,280
<font color="yellow">You can avoid accidents that way.</font>

809
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,440
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

810
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,670
<font color="yellow">What traffic sign should I see right now?</font>

811
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,200
<font color="yellow">A stop sign.</font>

812
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,240
<font color="yellow">When a car in front of you obstructs your way,</font>

813
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,840
<font color="yellow">there's nothing you can do about it.</font>

814
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,470
<font color="yellow">What if the brake doesn't work?</font>

815
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,640
<font color="yellow">What if I can't stop the car?</font>

816
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,570
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

817
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,200
<font color="yellow">What would you do?</font>

818
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,640
<font color="yellow">I should turn the wheel.</font>

819
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,100
<font color="yellow">Because I'm a wise one, capable of doing anything.</font>

820
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,040
<font color="yellow">My team?</font>

821
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,740
<font color="yellow">Why should we?</font>

822
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,700
<font color="yellow">It's not a hit-and-run any more.</font>

823
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,900
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

824
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,600
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

825
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,250
<font color="yellow">Please transfer me to Violent Crimes Unit Two...</font>

826
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,470
<font color="yellow">so I can investigate this case.</font>

827
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,500
<font color="yellow">What case?</font>

828
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,280
<font color="yellow">I need to find the evidence that Mr Shin found.</font>

829
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,920
<font color="yellow">I also need to ask around.</font>

830
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,870
<font color="yellow">I need a warrant to find evidence of murder...</font>

831
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

832
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,800
<font color="yellow">really should find the killer.</font>

833
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,200
<font color="yellow">Please give me your permission.</font>

834
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,070
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

835
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,800
<font color="yellow">You're talking like you're declaring war...</font>

836
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,570
<font color="yellow">- when you're surrendering.
-  Why would I...</font>

837
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,900
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that the suspect works at Hyunsung?</font>

838
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,060
<font color="yellow">Why should I be on the losing side of war?</font>

839
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,740
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to lose.</font>

840
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,840
<font color="yellow">She's out of her mind.</font>

841
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,740
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

842
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,840
<font color="yellow">Find the evidence and specify the suspect.</font>

843
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,000
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  Then, I'll take you in my team.</font>

844
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,440
<font color="yellow">Both you and this case.</font>

845
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,300
<font color="yellow">Sir...</font>

846
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,850
<font color="yellow">I... I'll be back.</font>

847
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:46,900
<font color="yellow">I'll be back!</font>

848
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,570
<font color="yellow">- Sir!
-  Sir!</font>

849
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,690
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

850
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,240
<font color="yellow">- She's a bit...
-  She's out of her mind.</font>

851
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,170
<font color="yellow">She might file a complaint of gender discrimination.</font>

852
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,570
<font color="yellow">I should make her give up.</font>

853
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,970
<font color="yellow">She never gives up.</font>

854
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:05,300
<font color="yellow">There are three kinds of people the police can't catch.</font>

855
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,640
<font color="yellow">Prosecutors, lawyers and doctors.</font>

856
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:08,840
<font color="yellow">It's Hyunsung for crying out loud.</font>

857
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:10,970
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

858
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,900
<font color="yellow">Do you think they're easy to deal with?</font>

859
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,300
<font color="yellow">Please allow the autopsy.</font>

860
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,590
<font color="yellow">If we can show that he was murdered,</font>

861
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,480
<font color="yellow">the Violent Crimes Division...</font>

862
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,940
<font color="yellow">who are better than me can start the investigation.</font>

863
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,300
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about it, Jin Sung.</font>

864
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,170
<font color="yellow">Would that be okay?</font>

865
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:38,770
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

866
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,270
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what is good for the sake of Mr Shin.</font>

867
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,200
<font color="yellow">What do you all think?</font>

868
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,500
<font color="yellow">She wants an autopsy on Mr Shin...</font>

869
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,940
<font color="yellow">to find out what went wrong with his surgery.</font>

870
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,500
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Dr Soh?</font>

871
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,170
<font color="yellow">The leading surgeon was Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

872
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

873
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,570
<font color="yellow">that Dr Lee made any mistakes.</font>

874
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin...</font>

875
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,800
<font color="yellow">loved and cared about...</font>

876
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,270
<font color="yellow">his junior surgeons.</font>

877
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,040
<font color="yellow">It won't be good...</font>

878
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,500
<font color="yellow">for the reputation of Mr Shin or this hospital.</font>

879
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,570
<font color="yellow">Do you all agree with him?</font>

880
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,040
<font color="yellow">Rather than leaving behind suspicion...
-  We would...</font>

881
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,390
<font color="yellow">like to remember him...</font>

882
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,270
<font color="yellow">as a doctor who dedicated his life for his patients...</font>

883
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,100
<font color="yellow">and as someone who was generous to fellow doctors.</font>

884
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,340
<font color="yellow">Officer.</font>

885
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,440
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin loved this hospital.</font>

886
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,140
<font color="yellow">There's no one here who wants...</font>

887
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,460
<font color="yellow">to see him wrapped up in a scandal...</font>

888
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,700
<font color="yellow">before we let him go.</font>

889
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,800
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am.
-  Are you trying...</font>

890
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,640
<font color="yellow">to bring Mr Shin...</font>

891
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,570
<font color="yellow">into derision like last time...</font>

892
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,940
<font color="yellow">because of your ambition?</font>

893
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,100
<font color="yellow">It is now time for us to say goodbye to him.</font>

894
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,600
<font color="yellow">But we still have hope...</font>

895
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,200
<font color="yellow">of meeting him again someday.</font>

896
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:31,270
<font color="yellow">By grieving our loss today,</font>

897
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,600
<font color="yellow">we can show our love for him,</font>

898
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,270
<font color="yellow">help each other overcome the grief...</font>

899
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,740
<font color="yellow">and give each other hope.</font>

900
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,410
<font color="yellow">Dear Father,</font>

901
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,200
<font color="yellow">We pray for the soul of our brother, Shin Dong Jae.</font>

902
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,070
<font color="yellow">Please forgive him for his sins...</font>

903
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,200
<font color="yellow">and let him rest in your kingdom with the saints.</font>

904
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,570
<font color="yellow">In Jesus Christ...</font>

905
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,570
<font color="yellow">Please allow me...</font>

906
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,540
<font color="yellow">to give the eulogy.</font>

907
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,640
<font color="yellow">I want to take responsibility...</font>

908
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,270
<font color="yellow">as the doctor who operated on him.</font>

909
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,600
<font color="yellow">The cause of death...</font>

910
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,770
<font color="yellow">for Mr Shin Dong Jae...</font>

911
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,870
<font color="yellow">was murder.</font>

912
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,370
<font color="yellow">This is the medication that he took for five years...</font>

913
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,770
<font color="yellow">to treat diabetes.</font>

914
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,740
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

915
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,570
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin's death...</font>

916
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,200
<font color="yellow">was caused by...</font>

917
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,160
<font color="yellow">one bag of pills.</font>

918
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,270
<font color="yellow">This isn't the place...</font>

919
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

920
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,970
<font color="yellow">A bag of pills can't be a lethal dose.</font>

921
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,790
<font color="yellow">It's basic pharmaceutical knowledge!</font>

922
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,640
<font color="yellow">It's just a bag of pills.</font>

923
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,070
<font color="yellow">But when insulin...</font>

924
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,250
<font color="yellow">meets pseudoephedrine,</font>

925
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,800
<font color="yellow">a drug found in common cold medicine,</font>

926
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,500
<font color="yellow">it becomes like a dynamite...</font>

927
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,900
<font color="yellow">that causes acute cerebral haemorrhage.</font>

928
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:15,240
<font color="yellow">Cerebral haemorrhage caused by hypertension...</font>

929
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,900
<font color="yellow">must have been the best way for the killer...</font>

930
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,100
<font color="yellow">who wanted it to look like a natural death.</font>

931
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,700
<font color="yellow">You can do an autopsy...</font>

932
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,200
<font color="yellow">if you're not...</font>

933
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,040
<font color="yellow">trying to avoid being blamed...</font>

934
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,100
<font color="yellow">for the failure of your surgery.</font>

935
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,740
<font color="yellow">That's not possible.</font>

936
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,000
<font color="yellow">Because someone...</font>

937
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,900
<font color="yellow">might do something to his body...</font>

938
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,870
<font color="yellow">just like they did with Patient Kang Chul Min.</font>

939
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,570
<font color="yellow">But don't worry.</font>

940
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,270
<font color="yellow">I took...</font>

941
