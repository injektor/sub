<font color="yellow">I am not normal.</font>

162
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,580
<font color="yellow">Because...</font>

163
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,710
<font color="yellow">your best efforts at making me normal...</font>

164
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,980
<font color="yellow">made me this way.</font>

165
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,980
<font color="yellow">But you tell me...</font>

166
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,430
<font color="yellow">to accept your shameless effort...</font>

167
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,210
<font color="yellow">because you tried your best.</font>

168
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,450
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Gun Myung.</font>

169
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,750
<font color="yellow">There is...</font>

170
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,480
<font color="yellow">no such exoneration in this world.</font>

171
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,250
<font color="yellow">Especially in here.</font>

172
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
<font color="yellow">We said...</font>

173
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,880
<font color="yellow">we didn't want surgery.</font>

174
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,980
<font color="yellow">My husband...</font>

175
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,850
<font color="yellow">suffered until he died...</font>

176
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,550
<font color="yellow">because of your stubbornness.</font>

177
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,110
<font color="yellow">This is his message...</font>

178
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,680
<font color="yellow">expressing how he truly felt.</font>

179
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,380
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

180
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,350
<font color="yellow">Don't give up.</font>

181
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,710
<font color="yellow">You promised...</font>

182
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,250
<font color="yellow">to live.</font>

183
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,280
<font color="yellow">Stop...</font>

184
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,350
<font color="yellow">You can start over, Dr Lee.</font>

185
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,250
<font color="yellow">Both you...</font>

186
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,610
<font color="yellow">and us.</font>

187
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,320
<font color="yellow">I was relieved.</font>

188
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,780
<font color="yellow">If it isn't brain damage,</font>

189
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,910
<font color="yellow">but because of a traumatic experience,</font>

190
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,750
<font color="yellow">it may...</font>

191
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,010
<font color="yellow">be more possible.</font>

192
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,950
<font color="yellow">You have me.</font>

193
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,550
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

194
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,150
<font color="yellow">will help.</font>

195
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,750
<font color="yellow">Min Jae.</font>

196
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,080
<font color="yellow">You already saw...</font>

197
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,480
<font color="yellow">that regardless of the cause,</font>

198
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,610
<font color="yellow">the result is the same.</font>

199
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,350
<font color="yellow">This is who I am.</font>

200
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
<font color="yellow">Too many patients...</font>

201
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,580
<font color="yellow">will be put in danger...</font>

202
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,910
<font color="yellow">because of me.</font>

203
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,210
<font color="yellow">Charge.</font>

204
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,250
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

205
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,650
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

206
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,680
<font color="yellow">Is that possible?</font>

207
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,080
<font color="yellow">He's in cardiac arrest.</font>

208
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,080
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

209
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,580
<font color="yellow">You promised...</font>

210
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,150
<font color="yellow">to live.</font>

211
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,980
<font color="yellow">Stop...</font>

212
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,480
<font color="yellow">Stop...</font>

213
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,250
<font color="yellow">Do you remember...</font>

214
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,780
<font color="yellow">when I said...</font>

215
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,750
<font color="yellow">I have to live...</font>

216
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,180
<font color="yellow">because I can't leave Eun Joo alone?</font>

217
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,680
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

218
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,450
<font color="yellow">the first person ever...</font>

219
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,210
<font color="yellow">to listen...</font>

220
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,680
<font color="yellow">to how I felt.</font>

221
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,450
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

222
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,650
<font color="yellow">you did your best...</font>

223
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,850
<font color="yellow">to keep...</font>

224
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,180
<font color="yellow">your promise.</font>

225
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,950
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,</font>

226
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,350
<font color="yellow">I wasn't alone...</font>

227
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,320
<font color="yellow">in my final moment.</font>

228
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,410
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

229
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,010
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

230
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,880
<font color="yellow">kept...</font>

231
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,110
<font color="yellow">your promise.</font>

232
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

233
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,780
<font color="yellow">so much.</font>

234
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,610
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

235
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,550
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you,</font>

236
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,910
<font color="yellow">nothing would've happened to me.</font>

237
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,710
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you,</font>

238
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,050
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have struggled so much to save him.</font>

239
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,080
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you, I would've lived in peace...</font>

240
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,010
<font color="yellow">as I have all these years,</font>

241
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,050
<font color="yellow">being thankful for being completely alone.</font>

242
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,850
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you,</font>

243
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,650
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't resent someone for making me this way.</font>

244
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,310
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you,</font>

245
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,390
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't do something stupid...</font>

246
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,590
<font color="yellow">like having hope because of some stupid tears.</font>

247
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,350
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you!</font>

248
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,810
<font color="yellow">I despise you more than anyone...</font>

249
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,610
<font color="yellow">in this entire world.</font>

250
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,010
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

251
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,750
<font color="yellow">disappear from my life.</font>

252
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,150
<font color="yellow">Whatever you say,</font>

253
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,510
<font color="yellow">I hear it as...</font>

254
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,780
<font color="yellow">"I love you."</font>

255
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't do as you asked.</font>

256
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,050
<font color="yellow">I can't leave you alone.</font>

257
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,780
<font color="yellow">I hope...</font>

258
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,080
<font color="yellow">you like...</font>

259
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,910
<font color="yellow">my gift.</font>

260
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,410
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

261
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,380
<font color="yellow">hug...</font>

262
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,250
<font color="yellow">my son...</font>

263
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,780
<font color="yellow">for me.</font>

264
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,110
<font color="yellow">I baptize you in the name of the Father,</font>

265
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,210
<font color="yellow">the Son and the Holy Spirit.</font>

266
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,580
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

267
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,280
<font color="yellow">This outfit is a bit...</font>

268
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,080
<font color="yellow">I made a promise.</font>

269
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,850
<font color="yellow">I need to keep it.</font>

270
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,010
<font color="yellow">I am not embarrassed at all,</font>

271
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,210
<font color="yellow">since I'm a psychopath...</font>

272
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,910
<font color="yellow">who can't feel emotions.</font>

273
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,950
<font color="yellow">This is Jo Jin Joo.</font>

274
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

275
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,940
<font color="yellow">baptize you...</font>

276
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,680
<font color="yellow">in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</font>

277
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,070
<font color="yellow">Should we get some cold noodles?</font>

278
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,250
<font color="yellow">It's so hot. It would be perfect.</font>

279
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,510
<font color="yellow">Anything is fine with me.</font>

280
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,850
<font color="yellow">Whatever you want.</font>

281
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,070
<font color="yellow">No. We should have a hearty lunch.</font>

282
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,150
<font color="yellow">I know a good pork cutlet place. Should we go there?</font>

283
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,150
<font color="yellow">Sure. We can go there.</font>

284
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,640
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

285
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,190
<font color="yellow">You don't want to walk around too much in that.</font>

286
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,550
<font color="yellow">Should we get something quick?</font>

287
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,750
<font color="yellow">Whether we have kimbap or tteokbokki, let's just eat.</font>

288
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,880
<font color="yellow">Once they enter our stomach, it doesn't matter.</font>

289
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,510
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any common sense?</font>

290
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,110
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

291
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,770
<font color="yellow">- And does this shirt embarrass you?
-  Pardon?</font>

292
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,050
<font color="yellow">I'm not embarrassed at all. I love it.</font>

293
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,110
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep wearing this.</font>

294
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,410
<font color="yellow">I'll get it in every single colour out there.</font>

295
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,080
<font color="yellow">I'll wear them all. Just watch.</font>

296
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,580
<font color="yellow">I just meant...</font>

297
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,110
<font color="yellow">And are you fickle or greedy?</font>

298
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,350
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to eat so many things?</font>

299
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,980
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep changing your mind?</font>

300
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,400
<font color="yellow">You should've just said...</font>

301
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,950
<font color="yellow">you wanted to go to a hotel!</font>

302
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,810
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, a hotel?</font>

303
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,930
<font color="yellow">A hotel buffet, where you can eat everything.</font>

304
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,450
<font color="yellow">Where you can eat anything you want.</font>

305
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,450
<font color="yellow">I told you,</font>

306
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,880
<font color="yellow">I hear everything you say as, "I love you."</font>

307
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,680
<font color="yellow">- But...
-  Let's go.</font>

308
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,310
<font color="yellow">- But...
-  Come on.</font>

309
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,850
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat a lot.</font>

310
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
<font color="yellow">You do that.</font>

311
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,510
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

312
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,780
<font color="yellow">- Did you see that?
-  What? What? What?</font>

313
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,310
<font color="yellow">When you wake up.</font>

314
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,110
<font color="yellow">With someone by your side.</font>

315
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,110
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

316
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,310
<font color="yellow">Were you calling me...</font>

317
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:47,010
<font color="yellow">or did you blurt that out in shock?</font>

318
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,850
<font color="yellow">I blurted it out.</font>

319
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,850
<font color="yellow">It looks good on you.</font>

320
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,480
<font color="yellow">Everyone lies, don't they?</font>

321
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,180
<font color="yellow">Do you have my schedule for today?</font>

322
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,050
<font color="yellow">Yes. Here you go.</font>

323
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,250
<font color="yellow">Okay. Dr Yang.</font>

324
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,550
<font color="yellow">I'm still in shock.</font>

325
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,710
<font color="yellow">- This is when you say it, right?
-  What?</font>

326
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,650
<font color="yellow">Why must we be the ones to be embarrassed?</font>

327
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,180
<font color="yellow">- Good morning.
-  Good morning.</font>

328
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,980
<font color="yellow">He must've been traumatised.</font>

329
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,810
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen him since the mortality conference.</font>

330
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,450
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

331
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,680
<font color="yellow">all we have to do is add patients with lung diseases...</font>

332
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,850
<font color="yellow">to our clinical trials before it goes public.</font>

333
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're getting it prepared.</font>

334
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,850
<font color="yellow">If the clinical trials prove it to be safe,</font>

335
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,850
<font color="yellow">the value of stem cells will exceed our expectations.</font>

336
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,980
<font color="yellow">With this market,</font>

337
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,750
<font color="yellow">you won't need to worry...</font>

338
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,340
<font color="yellow">about investments or stock price.</font>

339
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,880
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to have met...</font>

340
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,750
<font color="yellow">a dependable partner.</font>

341
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,310
<font color="yellow">Dr Song, when you were an assistant professor,</font>

342
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,810
<font color="yellow">you specialised in the respiratory system, right?</font>

343
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,110
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

344
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,710
<font color="yellow">You can work on the research article...</font>

345
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,410
<font color="yellow">Green Pharmacy wants.</font>

346
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,310
<font color="yellow">It would be an honour.</font>

347
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,650
<font color="yellow">I'll recruit study subjects...</font>

348
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,280
<font color="yellow">among patients suffering from respiratory disease...</font>

349
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,550
<font color="yellow">at our hospital.</font>

350
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,310
<font color="yellow">Did Green Pharmacy request the research...</font>

351
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,910
<font color="yellow">to include patients with respiratory diseases?</font>

352
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,280
<font color="yellow">Unlike the liver or kidney,</font>

353
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,410
<font color="yellow">the lung cannot be transplanted...</font>

354
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,080
<font color="yellow">from a live donor.</font>

355
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,580
<font color="yellow">It is...</font>

356
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,280
<font color="yellow">a critical organ after the brain and heart,</font>

357
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,650
<font color="yellow">which does not regenerate.</font>

358
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,880
<font color="yellow">You weren't interested...</font>

359
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,280
<font color="yellow">in incurable diseases...</font>

360
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,410
<font color="yellow">or regenerative medicine.</font>

361
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,610
<font color="yellow">It was the money and power you'd gain.</font>

362
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,510
<font color="yellow">That's why you killed Director Shin to get here.</font>

363
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,450
<font color="yellow">That's right. So what do you think...</font>

364
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,580
<font color="yellow">would make me hesitate? What would I have to fear?</font>

365
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,480
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter who it is.</font>

366
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,450
<font color="yellow">If anyone gets in my way,</font>

367
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,010
<font color="yellow">I will get rid of them...</font>

368
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,880
<font color="yellow">as I did Shin Dong Jae.</font>

369
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,310
<font color="yellow">This should be...</font>

370
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,480
<font color="yellow">enough to prove you murdered...</font>

371
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,850
<font color="yellow">Director Shin in court.</font>

372
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,310
<font color="yellow">- Why you...
-  I'm warning you.</font>

373
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,650
<font color="yellow">The regenerative research...</font>

374
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,780
<font color="yellow">won't go as you want any more.</font>

375
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,480
<font color="yellow">I told you before.</font>

376
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,750
<font color="yellow">The moment I chose to be a good doctor,</font>

377
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,380
<font color="yellow">I gave up on being a good person.</font>

378
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
<font color="yellow">You had...</font>

379
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,980
<font color="yellow">several chances to fix your mistakes.</font>

380
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,280
<font color="yellow">When I said the surgery went wrong,</font>

381
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,910
<font color="yellow">you should've taken that child to another doctor.</font>

382
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,510
<font color="yellow">When I realised my mistake and went to see you,</font>

383
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,050
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't have mocked me.</font>

384
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,850
<font color="yellow">And when I fell,</font>

385
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,350
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't have left me.</font>

386
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,750
<font color="yellow">In all those moments,</font>

387
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,480
<font color="yellow">you chose this result.</font>

388
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,380
<font color="yellow">I lost everything.</font>

389
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,110
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't operated on that child,</font>

390
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,980
<font color="yellow">I would've shared my son's final moments.</font>

391
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,850
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't made that mistake,</font>

392
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,810
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have lived with...</font>

393
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,010
<font color="yellow">guilt and responsibility...</font>

394
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,450
<font color="yellow">and wouldn't have turned him into a monster.</font>

395
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,580
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

396
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,250
<font color="yellow">why I put my life into regenerative medicine?</font>

397
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,010
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I wished surgeons would disappear?</font>

398
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,060
<font color="yellow">I hoped no one would live with regrets like I do.</font>

399
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,080
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

400
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,430
<font color="yellow">Are you saying regenerative medicine was...</font>

401
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,160
<font color="yellow">your way of making up for your mistakes?</font>

402
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,410
<font color="yellow">If you want an apology from me,</font>

403
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,310
<font color="yellow">don't bother.</font>

404
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,380
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

405
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,750
<font color="yellow">will not give up.</font>

406
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,720
<font color="yellow">You mean it? You can't take it back.</font>

407
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,010
<font color="yellow">I dislike everything about you,</font>

408
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,650
<font color="yellow">but your overreacting is the worst.</font>

409
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,220
<font color="yellow">I didn't say I'd date you.</font>

410
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,850
<font color="yellow">I'll just eat with you if you solve this.</font>

411
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,880
<font color="yellow">Plenty of women have never eaten with me,</font>

412
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,910
<font color="yellow">but no woman has eaten with me just once.</font>

413
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,080
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that is?</font>

414
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,110
<font color="yellow">You always pay, don't you?</font>

415
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,610
<font color="yellow">I don't buy affection from women with money.</font>

416
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,610
<font color="yellow">Don't forget.</font>

417
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,950
<font color="yellow">You need to solve this for us to eat together.</font>

418
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,880
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

419
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
<font color="yellow">This is for the medical licensing examination, right?</font>

420
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,620
<font color="yellow">Sort of. Good luck.</font>

421
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,750
<font color="yellow">I'll buy dinner.</font>

422
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,110
<font color="yellow">Look at her. Goodness. That girl...</font>

423
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,510
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she just admit she likes me?</font>

424
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,280
<font color="yellow">Why is she playing games?</font>

425
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,950
<font color="yellow">What choice do I have? I should play along.</font>

426
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,610
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

427
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,580
<font color="yellow">Two with endocarditis caused by mold and fungus.</font>

428
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,220
<font color="yellow">One with a cerebral aneurysm.</font>

429
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,880
<font color="yellow">What do they have in common?</font>

430
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,720
<font color="yellow">Wait a second. Why am I solving this?</font>

431
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,050
<font color="yellow">I should ask the power rangers.</font>

432
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,810
<font color="yellow">Why am I bothering?</font>

433
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,310
<font color="yellow">- Tell it to me straight.
-  Yes?</font>

434
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,840
<font color="yellow">Do you want to study or date?</font>

435
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,480
<font color="yellow">I want to do both.</font>

436
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,910
<font color="yellow">There are two things you can't get help with.</font>

437
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,220
<font color="yellow">One is studying,</font>

438
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,740
<font color="yellow">and the other is dating.</font>

439
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,980
<font color="yellow">I understand, but please help me.</font>

440
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,350
<font color="yellow">Dr Hwang is right about that.</font>

441
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,150
<font color="yellow">He has...</font>

442
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,050
<font color="yellow">- a bad memory.
-  What's that?</font>

443
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,300
<font color="yellow">When he joined the army,</font>

444
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,650
<font color="yellow">he asked his friend to take care of his girlfriend.</font>

445
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,310
<font color="yellow">- His friend saved her seat in the library...
-  Hey.</font>

446
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,850
<font color="yellow">- every day.
-  Duk Joong.</font>

447
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,400
<font color="yellow">- His girlfriend ended up...
-  Duk Joong.</font>

448
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,150
<font color="yellow">- cheating on him.
-  He's lying.</font>

449
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,680
<font color="yellow">His friend in this story is me.</font>

450
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,780
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

451
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,110
<font color="yellow">- She wasn't my girlfriend.
-  Is that true?</font>

452
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,110
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that.</font>

453
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,380
<font color="yellow">I just had a fling with her.</font>

454
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,610
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry about that.
-  Wow, Dr Kwon.</font>

455
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dr Hwang.</font>

456
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,850
<font color="yellow">She wasn't my girlfriend.</font>

457
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,750
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You can go ahead if you can.</font>

458
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,110
<font color="yellow">Not everyone can get help with things like that.</font>

459
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,050
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

460
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,290
<font color="yellow">I was bored anyway.</font>

461
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,570
<font color="yellow">We'll help you solve the problem.</font>

462
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,120
<font color="yellow">Let's work in two teams. The losing team buys drinks.</font>

463
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,270
<font color="yellow">I like that idea.</font>

464
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,500
<font color="yellow">- I'm in.
-  Me, too.</font>

465
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,550
<font color="yellow">A question for the medical licensing examination.</font>

466
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,880
<font color="yellow">- Fried chicken and beer.
-  We'll add sea snails.</font>

467
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,250
<font color="yellow">We'll add cream draft beer.</font>

468
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,720
<font color="yellow">Then, we'll add grilled dried pollack.</font>

469
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,850
<font color="yellow">- Deal.
-  Okay.</font>

470
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,250
<font color="yellow">Don't push me.</font>

471
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,810
<font color="yellow">That's tricky.</font>

472
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,250
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

473
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,010
<font color="yellow">Let me see... Gosh.</font>

474
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,600
<font color="yellow">Are you sure this is for the medical licensing exam?</font>

475
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sure.</font>

476
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,210
<font color="yellow">Timeout. We need to change players.</font>

477
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,810
<font color="yellow">The person who gave the question shouldn't be here.</font>

478
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,110
<font color="yellow">Sung Eun, you should leave.</font>

479
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,010
<font color="yellow">Am I out?</font>

480
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, you are.</font>

481
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,080
<font color="yellow">Who will replace him?</font>

482
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,550
<font color="yellow">- Dr Soh.
-  Yes?</font>

483
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,950
<font color="yellow">I have no idea.</font>

484
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,310
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang Sung Eun.</font>

485
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

486
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,150
<font color="yellow">Is this patient in this hospital?</font>

487
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,010
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about that.</font>

488
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,220
<font color="yellow">It's a question for the medical licensing exam.</font>

489
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,610
<font color="yellow">Since it's not a patient in this hospital,</font>

490
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,310
<font color="yellow">I don't have to solve this problem.</font>

491
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,310
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
-  Yes.</font>

492
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,260
<font color="yellow">What a shame.</font>

493
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,250
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, please wait.</font>

494
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,720
<font color="yellow">I made a bet with Dr Lee Shi Hyun.</font>

495
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,580
<font color="yellow">Do you know what it feels like to make a bet...</font>

496
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,350
<font color="yellow">just to have a meal with someone you like?</font>

497
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,350
<font color="yellow">It's a romantic feeling.</font>

498
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,380
<font color="yellow">Please help me, Dr Lee.</font>

499
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,080
<font color="yellow">- You made a bet?
-  Yes.</font>

500
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,050
<font color="yellow">You have to win it no matter what.</font>

501
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,410
<font color="yellow">Make sure you have a meal with her.</font>

502
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,880
<font color="yellow">- Step away.
-  But...</font>

503
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,480
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  How dare you?</font>

504
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,410
<font color="yellow">This is cheating.</font>

505
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,510
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

506
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,250
<font color="yellow">Your test results came out, Jin Sung.</font>

507
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,880
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

508
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,180
<font color="yellow">I guess that's why I'm here.</font>

509
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,550
<font color="yellow">Your heart is holding on well.</font>

510
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,980
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

511
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,810
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was so worried.</font>

512
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,280
<font color="yellow">I was so afraid to come here.</font>

513
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,510
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

514
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
<font color="yellow">Jin Sung.</font>

515
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,850
<font color="yellow">There's a problem...</font>

516
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,150
<font color="yellow">with your lungs.</font>

517
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,910
<font color="yellow">As a result of taking heart medication for a long time,</font>

518
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,910
<font color="yellow">you developed pulmonary fibrosis.</font>

519
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,750
<font color="yellow">I think that when Dr Lee Young Oh treated you...</font>

520
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,650
<font color="yellow">because your lungs filled with fluid,</font>

521
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,610
<font color="yellow">your lungs began to have problems.</font>

522
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,050
<font color="yellow">Let's run a thorough examination for now.</font>

523
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,080
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

524
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,050
<font color="yellow">What brought you here?</font>

525
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,810
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you.</font>

526
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,250
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see you, Dr Lee.</font>

527
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,950
<font color="yellow">Now that I've seen you, I'll get going.</font>

528
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,310
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

529
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,610
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about how you call me.</font>

530
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,880
<font color="yellow">I want you to change that.</font>

531
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,950
<font color="yellow">Most of those who call me "Doctor" are my patients.</font>

532
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,110
<font color="yellow">I don't like you calling me "Doctor".</font>

533
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,950
<font color="yellow">How else can you call me instead?</font>

534
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
<font color="yellow">Give it a thought.</font>

535
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,880
<font color="yellow">I don't like "Mister", either.</font>

536
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,950
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll walk you out.</font>

537
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,050
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

538
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,810
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

539
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,910
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

540
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,850
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

541
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,980
<font color="yellow">I need an ABG and an EKG!</font>

542
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

543
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,880
<font color="yellow">I'll treat her as I'm her doctor.</font>

544
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,910
<font color="yellow">She just had a consultation with me.</font>

545
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,550
<font color="yellow">Ultrasound scan.</font>

546
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,050
<font color="yellow">She has acute interstitial pneumonia.</font>

547
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,080
<font color="yellow">It will...</font>

548
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,380
<font color="yellow">develop rapidly.</font>

549
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,810
<font color="yellow">She already developed pulmonary fibrosis.</font>

550
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,950
<font color="yellow">I'll administer antibiotics and an antiviral agent.</font>

551
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,210
<font color="yellow">If she doesn't get better,</font>

552
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,210
<font color="yellow">there will be only one solution left.</font>

553
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,210
<font color="yellow">We'll put her on the transplant waiting list,</font>

554
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,250
<font color="yellow">and wait for a donor.</font>

555
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,610
<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait for a lung transplant?</font>

556
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,910
<font color="yellow">We can't transplant lungs from a living donor.</font>

557
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,210
<font color="yellow">We can't be sure how long she'll have to wait.</font>

558
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,480
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

559
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,780
<font color="yellow">that she has to wait for that?</font>

560
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,810
<font color="yellow">I should apply for a lung transplant?</font>

561
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,120
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

562
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,350
<font color="yellow">Your heart has been weak for a long time,</font>

563
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,410
<font color="yellow">which caused a problem in your lungs.</font>

564
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,810
<font color="yellow">It's your heart's turn to help your weak lungs,</font>

565
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
<font color="yellow">but your heart...</font>

566
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,050
<font color="yellow">isn't strong enough to do that.</font>

567
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,750
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

568
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,580
<font color="yellow">you won't be able to rely on a machine...</font>

569
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,710
<font color="yellow">for a long time.</font>

570
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,650
<font color="yellow">Applying for a transplant...</font>

571
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,180
<font color="yellow">isn't treatment.</font>

572
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,180
<font color="yellow">You mean I have to wait...</font>

573
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,010
<font color="yellow">until luck finds me, right?</font>

574
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,250
<font color="yellow">Ma'am,</font>

575
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,980
<font color="yellow">would you like to receive treatment?</font>

576
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,750
<font color="yellow">You suggested Gye Jin Sung...</font>

577
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,010
<font color="yellow">our clinical trial?</font>

578
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. It's a good opportunity.</font>

579
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,390
<font color="yellow">It's free and she'll receive high-quality care.</font>

580
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,890
<font color="yellow">If we can treat her pulmonary fibrosis,</font>

581
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,610
<font color="yellow">she can return to her normal life without a transplant.</font>

582
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,050
<font color="yellow">What's the problem?</font>

583
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,610
<font color="yellow">Suk Joo, do you...</font>

584
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,610
<font color="yellow">still have doubts on our research?</font>

585
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,750
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

586
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,350
<font color="yellow">giving those heart failure patients...</font>

587
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,510
<font color="yellow">regenerative medicine treatment...</font>

588
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,380
<font color="yellow">despite your doubts on the treatment?</font>

589
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,480
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

590
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,580
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

591
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,050
<font color="yellow">You're here to solve the problem, right?</font>

592
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,780
<font color="yellow">I didn't know we had such good teamwork.</font>

593
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,010
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, have you found any clues?</font>

594
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,310
<font color="yellow">- "Lungs"?
-  "Lungs".</font>

595
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,350
<font color="yellow">- "Lungs".
-  "Lungs".</font>

596
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,940
<font color="yellow">You've become so down-to-earth recently...</font>

597
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,480
<font color="yellow">making a mistake like that.</font>

598
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,770
<font color="yellow">You can tell him. We're on the same team.</font>

599
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,010
<font color="yellow">- Can I?
-  Sure.</font>

600
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,650
<font color="yellow">We found...</font>

601
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,950
<font color="yellow">a similarity...</font>

602
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,650
<font color="yellow">among the three patients.</font>

603
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,850
<font color="yellow">All three of them...</font>

604
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,710
<font color="yellow">had the same surgery in the past.</font>

605
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:17,180
<font color="yellow">- It's heart valve surgery.
-  Heart valve surgery.</font>

606
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,280
<font color="yellow">- Here we go, here we go.
-  Here we go.</font>

607
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,050
<font color="yellow">Heart valve surgery.</font>

608
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,480
<font color="yellow">How dare you wake a third-year resident?</font>

609
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,630
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?
-  Dr Yang.</font>

610
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,550
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

611
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,980
<font color="yellow">The three cases for the quiz...</font>

612
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,010
<font color="yellow">aren't for the medical licensing exam, right?</font>

613
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,810
<font color="yellow">I... I'm sure they are.</font>

614
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,350
<font color="yellow">Why would Dr Lee lie to me?</font>

615
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,380
<font color="yellow">Where is she now?</font>

616
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,780
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Shi Hyun!</font>

617
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:07,880
<font color="yellow">I think she went that way.</font>

618
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,250
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Shi Hyun.</font>

619
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,050
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee. Dr...</font>

620
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,050
<font color="yellow">Your quiz.</font>

621
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,050
<font color="yellow">Who are the three patients?</font>

622
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,150
<font color="yellow">Which hospital are they at?</font>

623
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,310
<font color="yellow">I can't say here.</font>

624
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,280
<font color="yellow">They were our patients.</font>

625
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,950
<font color="yellow">I think you already knew that.</font>

626
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,780
<font color="yellow">You're more interesting than I thought.</font>

627
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,050
<font color="yellow">Why did you make a quiz...</font>

628
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,050
<font color="yellow">with those three cases?</font>

629
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,880
<font color="yellow">You even asked Dr Yang solve it.</font>

630
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,710
<font color="yellow">The patients developed the same lesions...</font>

631
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,010
<font color="yellow">at the same time.</font>

632
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,750
<font color="yellow">Their personal information was kept secret.</font>

633
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,050
<font color="yellow">When I raised a question about them,</font>

634
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,880
<font color="yellow">I got replaced by another resident.</font>

635
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,080
<font color="yellow">I couldn't ask anyone because I wasn't sure...</font>

636
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,010
<font color="yellow">who in this hospital was related to the cases.</font>

637
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,050
<font color="yellow">I was afraid.</font>

638
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,850
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

639
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,930
<font color="yellow">I wanted to let as many people as possible know.</font>

640
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,550
<font color="yellow">I thought Dr Yang was the perfect person to do that.</font>

641
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,580
<font color="yellow">You said they had the same lesion, right?</font>

642
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,710
<font color="yellow">All three of them had...</font>

643
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,810
<font color="yellow">endocarditis and cerebral aneurysm, right?</font>

644
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,580
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

645
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,980
<font color="yellow">It's a rare lesion. I couldn't find out what it was.</font>

646
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,850
<font color="yellow">Do you have any idea?</font>

647
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,250
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

648
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,050
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

649
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,380
<font color="yellow">tell me.</font>

650
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,210
<font color="yellow">Will I survive...</font>

651
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,680
<font color="yellow">if I receive the regenerative medicine treatment?</font>

652
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,350
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's safe?</font>

653
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:42,350
<font color="yellow">- Jin Sung.
-  I've doubted you,</font>

654
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,380
<font color="yellow">and hated you,</font>

655
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,110
<font color="yellow">but you're the only person who can give me an answer.</font>

656
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:57,910
<font color="yellow">So please tell me.</font>

657
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:02,610
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

658
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,680
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

659
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,110
<font color="yellow">I want to live.</font>

660
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:16,750
<font color="yellow">I don't want to die.</font>

661
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,850
<font color="yellow">I think I know...</font>

662
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,880
<font color="yellow">who these patients are.</font>

663
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,480
<font color="yellow">Who are they?</font>

664
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,280
<font color="yellow">They're clinical trial patients...</font>

665
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,150
<font color="yellow">of the regenerative medicine research.</font>

666
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,280
<font color="yellow">They're part of the project...</font>

667
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,580
<font color="yellow">led by Dr Hyun Suk Joo for commercialising...</font>

668
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,380
<font color="yellow">the regenerative medicine.</font>

669
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,380
<font color="yellow">Ki Ho.</font>

670
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,750
<font color="yellow">Let's begin...</font>

671
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,010
<font color="yellow">the stem cell treatment for Gye Jin Sung.</font>

672
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,280
<font color="yellow">I have to save her.</font>

673
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,950
<font color="yellow">Call Dr Hyun. Hurry.</font>

674
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,350
<font color="yellow">Neither antibiotics nor the antiviral agent worked.</font>

675
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,380
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.</font>

676
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,850
<font color="yellow">ECMO... Get the ECMO now.</font>

677
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,440
<font color="yellow">Even with the ECMO,</font>

678
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,880
<font color="yellow">she won't be able to hold on for long due to her heart.</font>

679
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,510
<font color="yellow">I won't ask if you slept well...</font>

680
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,080
<font color="yellow">because I know you suffered a lot.</font>

681
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,780
<font color="yellow">I won't ask...</font>

682
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,380
<font color="yellow">if you were worried...</font>

683
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,310
<font color="yellow">because I'd feel bad.</font>

684
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:36,850
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

685
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,810
<font color="yellow">decided to receive the treatment.</font>

686
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,080
<font color="yellow">The regenerative medicine treatment for my lungs...</font>

687
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,150
<font color="yellow">from Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

688
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:59,410
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you asking me...</font>

689
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,750
<font color="yellow">if I doubt him,</font>

690
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,380
<font color="yellow">or if I trust him?</font>

691
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,350
<font color="yellow">You made me a promise.</font>

692
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,380
<font color="yellow">You promised...</font>

693
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,680
<font color="yellow">you won't leave me alone.</font>

694
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,150
<font color="yellow">Keep your promise. That's all I need.</font>

695
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,410
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

696
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,650
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

697
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,780
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

698
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,950
<font color="yellow">Young Oh, are you out of your mind?</font>

699
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,450
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

700
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,550
<font color="yellow">You want to use...</font>

701
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,080
<font color="yellow">the regenerative medicine on Jin Sung?</font>

702
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:25,910
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what that means?</font>

703
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,010
<font color="yellow">That will never happen, as long as I'm around.</font>

704
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080
<font color="yellow">It was you.</font>

705
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,750
<font color="yellow">The reason she wanted to live so badly.</font>

706
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,680
<font color="yellow">Our regenerative medicine...</font>

707
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,050
<font color="yellow">is her only hope.</font>

708
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,680
<font color="yellow">Look, Suk Joo.</font>

709
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,150
<font color="yellow">Three people developed...</font>

710
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,580
<font color="yellow">infectious diseases...</font>

711
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,610
<font color="yellow">due to abnormal lesions.</font>

712
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,710
<font color="yellow">They were all patients...</font>

713
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,150
<font color="yellow">from your clinical study.</font>

714
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,350
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

715
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,510
<font color="yellow">still believe regenerative medicine is safe?</font>

716
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:14,950
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

717
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,310
<font color="yellow">We had no patients with negative effects.</font>

718
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,650
<font color="yellow">We tried our best to make sure it was safe.</font>

719
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:27,300
<font color="yellow">I checked the data every day with my own eyes.</font>

720
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,250
<font color="yellow">Anyone can lie in the reports.</font>

721
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,010
<font color="yellow">The problem is...</font>

722
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,250
<font color="yellow">with medicine,</font>

723
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,810
<font color="yellow">those errors are people.</font>

724
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,810
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun. I'll give you a chance to right it.</font>

725
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,950
<font color="yellow">All three of those patients...</font>

726
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,680
<font color="yellow">have received heart valve surgeries and Jin Sung...</font>

727
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,810
<font color="yellow">also received that same surgery.</font>

728
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,610
<font color="yellow">Do you still think her only option...</font>

729
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,650
<font color="yellow">is regenerative medicine?</font>

730
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,050
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

731
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,250
<font color="yellow">If you'll raise issue with that,</font>

732
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,180
<font color="yellow">I'll have to remove them from the results,</font>

733
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,910
<font color="yellow">so that they never would've existed.</font>

734
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,550
<font color="yellow">Were there no problems in stage three...</font>

735
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,610
<font color="yellow">which let us get approval so quickly...</font>

736
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,180
<font color="yellow">because you deleted the test subjects...</font>

737
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,950
<font color="yellow">that showed abnormalities?</font>

738
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:32,950
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

739
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,380
<font color="yellow">Do you need evidence for court again?</font>

740
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,250
<font color="yellow">Will you record me?</font>

741
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,250
<font color="yellow">Don't forget.</font>

742
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,580
<font color="yellow">You're the one who told the world...</font>

743
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,510
<font color="yellow">that stage three is safe.</font>

744
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:49,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you want to expose the truth,</font>

745
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,480
<font color="yellow">but think long and hard.</font>

746
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,780
<font color="yellow">All you'll get...</font>

747
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,110
<font color="yellow">is a revocation of your license.</font>

748
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,210
<font color="yellow">You wanted to be a good doctor.</font>

749
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,350
<font color="yellow">You are right.</font>

750
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,610
<font color="yellow">What I wanted from the start...</font>

751
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:06,980
<font color="yellow">was to be a good doctor.</font>

752
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,480
<font color="yellow">Gye Jin Sung, was it?</font>

753
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,950
<font color="yellow">Lung regeneration stem cell transplant.</font>

754
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,680
<font color="yellow">It's our first project with Green Pharmacy.</font>

755
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,150
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang is very interested too.</font>

756
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,980
<font color="yellow">Make no mistakes.</font>

757
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:28,350
<font color="yellow">What do you want us to do?</font>

758
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,050
<font color="yellow">We just solved a quiz for chicken and beer.</font>

759
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,610
<font color="yellow">You want us to do something that dangerous?</font>

760
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,980
<font color="yellow">Just because there are five of us...</font>

761
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,680
<font color="yellow">doesn't mean we're the Power Rangers.</font>

762
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:43,210
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

763
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,250
<font color="yellow">Duk Joong.</font>

764
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,280
<font color="yellow">Kyung Jin.</font>

765
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:53,810
<font color="yellow">Ji Yong.</font>

766
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,380
<font color="yellow">Jung Hwan.</font>

767
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,950
<font color="yellow">And you.</font>

768
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,980
<font color="yellow">Jang Bae.</font>

769
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,980
<font color="yellow">You started this,</font>

770
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,080
<font color="yellow">so please,</font>

771
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,680
<font color="yellow">take responsibility and finish it.</font>

772
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,150
<font color="yellow">Do you still think her only option...</font>

773
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,380
<font color="yellow">is regenerative medicine?</font>

774
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,480
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have time to wait for a donor.</font>

775
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,910
<font color="yellow">We can't transplant a lung from a live donor.</font>

776
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,080
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

777
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,250
<font color="yellow">what choice can we make?</font>

778
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,310
<font color="yellow">The one that is the best for the patient.</font>

779
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,580
<font color="yellow">Transplant...</font>

780
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,080
<font color="yellow">a lung from a live person...</font>

781
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,510
<font color="yellow">into her.</font>

782
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,850
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you again.</font>

783
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,180
<font color="yellow">Lung transplants from live donors...</font>

784
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,450
<font color="yellow">are illegal because it endangers the life of the donor.</font>

785
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,450
<font color="yellow">Do you still want to do this?</font>

786
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,780
<font color="yellow">It is illegal...</font>

787
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:51,010
