00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,070
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,520
You're a quack, aren't you?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,650
Did you play basketball instead of studying?

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,720
Why don't you test me?

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,690
Let me cut you open and see...

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,590
how many rooms there are...

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,590
in that player's heart.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,020
Again!

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,450
My wife is almost due.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,350
I will be...

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
a dad soon.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,290
Okay, here I go.

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,690
People don't change.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,250
Hey.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,020
What's wrong?

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,590
Chang Soo. Wake up.

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
Chang Soo!

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,890
Chang Soo.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,660
Chang Soo!

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,990
There was an accident at the factory.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,870
A worker lost his sight...

22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,200
from exposure to methanol!

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,750
The chairman is about to have dinner.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Let go.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,550
It's because you used methanol instead of ethanol...

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,120
to save a few bucks.

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,650
The company should pay for medical and living expenses.

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,690
Give him compensation for damages, too.

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,370
This is an industrial accident, Father.

30
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,890
Our factory did nothing wrong.

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,020
He was careless.

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,090
He was just unlucky.

33
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,390
When you built the factory,

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,100
you said Chang Soo was family.

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,120
Tell him...

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,820
if he complains about this,

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
we will sue for damages for the loss...

38
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,720
the company suffered due to his injury.

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,910
Sit down.

40
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,650
Let's talk about something more suitable at the table.

41
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,820
I will never sit at this table again.

42
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,650
I'm afraid even I'll go blind in this house.

43
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,990
The world is a battlefield!

44
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,590
In a battlefield where bullets are flying,

45
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,950
those with warm hearts die first.

46
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,060
Is that how you want to end up?

47
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,890
You...

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,020
are my son.

49
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,720
You've always had...

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,950
everything you could possible want.

51
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,090
You're used to winning.

52
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,690
You'll end up picking up a gun.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,950
When you do,

54
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,890
you'll want to shoot it...

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,490
with all your might...

56
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,420
without consideration,

57
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,790
just like your old man.

58
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,250
No.

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,990
I will never end up like you.

60
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,120
I will do everything I can...

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,220
to be different.

62
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,720
(Beautiful Mind)

63
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,680
- BP.
 -  180 over 60.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,700
His BP is unstable and dangerous.

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,290
He's losing consciousness.

66
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,650
Did he collapse while working?

67
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,450
- Without any symptoms?
 -  Yes.

68
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,850
Mr Chairman.

69
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,590
Father.

70
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,720
What happened?

71
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,120
Why out of the blue?

72
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,990
Why now?

73
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,550
You dropped your towel.

74
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,320
So,

75
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,020
how long have you been a member...

76
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,150
at this gym?

77
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,690
Do you want to know?

78
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,720
Shall we make a bet?

79
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,250
Buy dinner if you win.

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
I'll tell you if I lose.

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,420
What are you doing?

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,420
I've already completed my workout.

83
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,190
I'm not curious about you enough...

84
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,490
to burn more calories.

85
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,490
That's right.

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
"Shall we make a bet?"

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,990
Don't say that.

88
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,090
It doesn't...

89
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,590
suit you.

90
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,920
You're racking up a lot of points.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,270
Drive carefully, or your license will be suspended.

92
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,720
- I will. Thank you.
 -  Okay? Good.

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
Dr Lee Young Oh?

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,860
Funny seeing you here.

95
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,490
This is my zone.

96
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,120
You just went the opposite way in a one-way street.

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,190
Excuse me...

98
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,950
Are you really Dr Lee Young Oh?

99
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,690
I mean, why are you here...

100
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,590
in this area at this hour?

101
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,370
And it's not like you...

102
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,790
to get caught so easily, either.

103
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,590
You seem very strange right now.

104
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,120
- I feel like...
 -  Don't tell me...

105
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,820
you think...

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,390
I came...

107
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,590
to your zone...

108
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,350
during lunch time, of all times,

109
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,350
and intentionally...

110
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,850
got caught...

111
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,090
- by you.
 -  No. That's not what I was saying.

112
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,650
I thought...

113
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,020
you'd be...

114
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,090
working very hard to return to Hyunsung Medical Centre.

115
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,650
I will not work at trying to return...

116
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,850
to Hyunsung...

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Medical Centre.

118
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,090
Why would I?

119
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,190
You thought and supposed all on your own...

120
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,250
and came to an incorrect conclusion.

121
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,020
If you want to know what I'm thinking, just call.

122
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,050
Okay?

123
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,550
What is it?

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,350
You said to call if I'm curious.

125
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm calling.

126
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,150
Have you eaten yet?

127
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,220
What's the cause?

128
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,690
Sudden quadriplegia and loss of consciousness.

129
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,060
Tumour Centre.

130
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,610
Dr Hwang, have you checked the file?

131
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,990
Yes. There was nothing suspicious.

132
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,650
Neurosurgery. Anything wrong with the brain?

133
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,580
No. The MRI and angiography both came back clear.

134
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,420
Neurology. Didn't he have a check-up recently?

135
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,090
Didn't you say everything was fine?

136
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,870
- Yes, Sir. The...
 -  It looks like...

137
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,190
a temporary paralysis caused by...

138
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,790
high blood pressure diabetes.

139
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,050
It's a TIA and myoischemia.

140
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,320
He'll be fine with the proper medicine.

141
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,550
Goodness.

142
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Are you sure?

143
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,090
With the proper medicine,

144
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,620
will he really wake up...

145
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,590
as the nasty old man screaming at me?

146
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,720
Even with medication,

147
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,420
we can't control how he treats you.

148
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,250
You'll hear it again, even if you don't want to.

149
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,520
You are so easy-going.

150
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,120
How can you...

151
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,120
laugh right now?

152
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,350
My heart is pounding like crazy...

153
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,190
and I feel like I'm drying up right now!

154
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,620
What if that old man...

155
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,460
never wakes up...

156
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,350
and I can't become Hyunsung's successor?

157
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,320
What if Dr Chae Soon Ho, whom I respect greatly,

158
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,500
is found guilty of a horrid murder...

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,710
and ends up in prison...

160
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,660
during the prime of his life...

161
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,960
and never becomes the director at Hyunsung?

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,020
I am just so concerned.

163
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,390
I've been the chairman's doctor...

164
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,720
for 15 years.

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,250
None of the things you worry about will happen.

166
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,460
The chairman will recover soon,

167
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,460
and the regenerative medicine...

168
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,850
will receive FDA approval...

169
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,220
and bring hope to all who wish for cures...

170
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,720
for incurable diseases.

171
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,690
Shouldn't they reopen investigations...

172
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,220
for the Hyunsung serial murders?

173
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,190
We know Kang Chul Min's secret doctor...

174
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,650
is at Hyunsung Medical Centre.

175
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,820
He's either the serial killer...

176
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,890
or the one calling the shots is at Hyunsung.

177
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,650
Look. The case has been closed.

178
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,290
Everyone else wants to bury it,

179
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,820
but you want to reopen it.

180
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,450
You're a traffic cop nonetheless...

181
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,090
trying to take on the great Hyunsung.

182
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,500
Why are you so reckless?

183
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,290
You'll never win. No one else would even try.

184
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Well?

185
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,620
Because I want a drink.

186
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,820
Mr Shin...

187
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,820
promised to have...

188
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,050
a drink with me after we uncover the truth.

189
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,350
He didn't pass away due to an unfortunate accident.

190
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,620
I'm going to tell the world what happened.

191
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,350
That way...

192
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,920
I can enjoy a drink again.

193
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,090
So what do you plan to do?

194
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,050
I should...

195
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,050
start from scratch, right?

196
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,520
It'll be hard since I have no clues or leads.

197
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,650
Do you think you couldn't catch the killer...

198
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,790
because you had no clues or leads?

199
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
No. This world...

200
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,790
doesn't care about...

201
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,120
the truth.

202
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,190
Then this time,

203
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,850
I'll give the world a chance.

204
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
One more time.

205
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,020
It's kind of like a ring,

206
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,790
but it's a soju bottle cap.

207
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,050
Have you seen it?

208
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I have not.

209
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,820
Shall we make a bet?

210
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,550
This is...

211
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,490
the lead that you're looking for.

212
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,180
It's also Hyunsung's secret...

213
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,050
that Mr Shin wanted to expose.

214
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,250
It's the study results of Dr Shim Eun Ha,

215
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
who I wanted to speak at the Mortality Conference.

216
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,990
You said with this lead,

217
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,550
you can catch the real killer, right?

218
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,330
Fine. Go ahead.

219
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,500
Let's make a bet.

220
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,850
Will I win, or will you?

221
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
However,

222
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,040
you will be unable to read this on your own.

223
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,720
Someone with expertise...

224
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,490
and knowledge about medical science...

225
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,190
must be with you.

226
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,690
You may have to bother that person every day.

227
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,220
For example, by calling...

228
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,050
or needing to meet.

229
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,090
Do you understand?

230
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,590
Here.

231
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,150
Hey.

232
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,620
Give it...

233
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,190
Why won't you...

234
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,420
Thank you.

235
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,190
I'm surprised...

236
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,580
that you won't return to Hyunsung.

237
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,150
I never said I won't return.

238
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,050
I said I don't need to work at it.

239
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
Because...

240
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,090
Hyunsung will call me.

241
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,050
What is it? What's wrong with him?

242
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,790
Did you give him the medicine that I ordered?

243
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,520
Did you check his blood sugar level?

244
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,320
This shouldn't have happened.

245
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,720
It is not TIA and myoischemia.

246
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,820
Tell Dr Chae, the chairman's attending,

247
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,490
that we need to rerun the tests.

248
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,090
Tests. Tests. Tests!

249
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,320
What?

250
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,890
Where? How?

251
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,150
We've run every test that Hyunsung can run.

252
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,320
We've used every top-of-the-line equipment,

253
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,680
but we were unable to find anything wrong.

254
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,610
What does a paper-writing lab rat like you...

255
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,850
with no experience know?

256
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,720
His ACTH, the adrenocorticotropic hormone level...

257
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,450
is very high. There's a high probability of a tumour.

258
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,890
That is my opinion as a specialist.

259
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,920
If you won't do it, I'll tell him myself.

260
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,350
Is it me this time?

261
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,250
Tell me, Dr Kim.

262
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,020
Do you want to ignore proper protocol...

263
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,890
and step on me this time...

264
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,920
to become Chairman Kang's attending? Is that it?

265
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,450
- Doctor.
 -  Quiet! All of you!

266
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,650
I am Chairman Kang's attending.

267
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,850
I will think and decide.

268
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,890
What's wrong with the chairman?

269
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,990
Doctor, it's an insulin shock.

270
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,150
This is a huge accident.

271
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,520
Poor Dr Yoo.

272
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,780
He should be banished. He misdiagnosed him.

273
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,990
- You may be the one banished.
 -  Why?

274
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,760
Imagine they find a neurological illness.

275
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,640
You'll be the one being exiled for life.

276
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,290
- Hello.
 -  Out of my way!

277
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,350
That's why Joseon failed.

278
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,700
Why would you banish the royal physician?

279
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,850
I'm speechless.

280
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,320
Wow. These people...

281
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,850
It's like a war broke out or something.

282
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,960
You can't blame them.

283
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,470
When he first came in, they said it was myoischemia,

284
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,860
so I thought he was testing his children's devotion,

285
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,440
but now, he's fighting for his life.

286
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,020
Goodness. Chairman Kang's life?

287
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,790
I'm more worried about myself.

288
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,520
Dr Chae, the next hospital director,

289
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
was my dad's classmate,

290
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,120
so I thought I'd get hired once I'm done.

291
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,990
- Darn.
 -  Then,

292
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,550
is Dr Lee Gun Myung's chances better now?

293
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,710
The hospital director position isn't the problem.

294
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,220
With the owner's sons fighting,

295
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,200
the owner of the hospital may change entirely.

296
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,290
I should look...

297
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,020
at other hospitals for the specialist positions.

298
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,220
Hi, Mum.

299
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,720
Yes, don't...

300
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,020
Don't worry too much. This is also Hyunsung.

301
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,250
The top doctors from the nation...

302
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,250
are on alert and tending to Father.

303
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,420
He'll be fully recovered before you return...

304
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,620
from your business trip...

305
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,690
You're the one who wants...

306
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,720
to end his life right now...

307
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,720
since you want to take over Hyunsung.

308
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,690
You won't have to kiss up to that ill-tempered old man.

309
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,250
Right?

310
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,690
Listen to me.

311
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,190
I'm the one who wants...

312
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,090
to save that old man the most. Why?

313
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,220
That way Hyunsung will be mine.

314
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,590
Because I need time.

315
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
So,

316
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,290
stop pretending to be so worried.

317
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,760
I can smell the stench of your nag even from here.

318
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,790
Got it?

319
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,720
You slime ball.

320
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,790
Sir.

321
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,790
He hung up a while ago...

322
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,090
because of his temper.

323
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,350
Do you have a religion?

324
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,720
Go pray...

325
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,120
that a thunder storm will cancel his flight.

326
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,490
No, forget that.

327
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,410
It would be better...

328
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,090
if his plane blew up...

329
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,690
in the middle of the Pacific.

330
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,020
Pray for that, please.

331
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,820
What is it?

332
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,450
I need to discuss Chairman Kang's condition with you.

333
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,520
With me?

334
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,690
Why?

335
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,780
Do only ambitious doctors...

336
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,450
who want to get ahead like I do care about his care?

337
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,850
That isn't what I meant.

338
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,820
You seem...

339
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,120
to be nice to everyone.

340
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,390
But why do I feel like you're always fighting...

341
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,550
like I am?

342
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Disrespect. Discrimination. Oppression.

343
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,790
Those are what I'm fighting against, but you...

344
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,550
You said you were here about Chairman Kang.

345
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,420
Please help me...

346
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,720
treat Chairman Kang Il Do.

347
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,790
I'm sorry, Sir.

348
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,590
I'm terribly sorry.

349
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,450
I asked you for...

350
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,520
a precise diagnosis and treatment for Chairman Kang.

351
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,690
Not a cheap apology like this!

352
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,590
Yes, you are right. I'm sorry.

353
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,590
Oh, dear.

354
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,220
What are all of you doing?

355
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,350
Do something!

356
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,220
Based on the test results,

357
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,720
it is impossible to make a diagnosis.

358
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,420
Not many doctors...

359
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,190
can prescribe something unsure for Chairman Kang.

360
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,420
This risk is too high,

361
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,390
both for the patient...

362
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,190
and for the medical staff.

363
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,120
Are you honest or shameless?

364
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,250
Don't you realise...

365
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,520
what you just said means...

366
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,020
you don't want to take responsibility?

367
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,420
Chairman Kang...

368
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,450
may have lung cancer.

369
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,950
A tumour?

370
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,850
The tumour centre didn't find it during the screening.

371
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,950
What proof do you have?

372
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,840
Are you sure?

373
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,020
It didn't show up on the PET scan or CT scan,

374
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,810
but while he was hospitalised,

375
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,250
his ACTH level had been rising.

376
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,990
The tumour is probably hiding where it can't be seen.

377
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,120
There is no other way to explain...

378
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,620
his present condition.

379
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,590
What if we open him up and you're wrong?

380
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,890
Do you want to play find-the-tumour...

381
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,190
with a man nearing 80?

382
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,450
Opening up his chest may be deadlier than the tumour.

383
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,520
Answer me.

384
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Can you...

385
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,620
take responsibility?

386
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,850
We should do it without opening his chest.

387
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,090
As long as we don't open up his chest,

388
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,620
Dr Kim's opinion...

389
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,890
is the best we can do at this time.

390
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
It may be our last option as well.

391
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,520
They plan to remove a tumour in the lung...

392
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
without opening his chest or spilling any blood.

393
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,590
Did...

394
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,520
Did you say the lead surgeon is Dr Hyun Suk Joo?

395
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,590
That's correct.

396
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,450
May I trust you this time,

397
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,850
Dr Chae?

398
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,090
Let's go.

399
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,720
Chairman Kang's BP and vitals...

400
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,050
are all stable.

401
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,690
Dr Hyun opted for a thoracoscopic surgery.

402
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,390
It will be quite difficult.

403
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,820
Chairman Kang's BP has to hang in there.

404
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,690
I want just one thing.

405
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,190
Seeing Father wake up and back to normal...

406
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,150
before my brother lands in Korea.

407
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,590
You should do that much for me,

408
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,650
shouldn't you?

409
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,090
I'm surprised.

410
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,700
I never thought...

411
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,990
you'd be so proactive about Chairman Kang.

412
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm also surprised.

413
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,220
Do you still not know why I am being so proactive...

414
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,220
about operating on your patient?

415
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,290
I've located...

416
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,350
a tumour.

417
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,220
The tumour has been removed.

418
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,060
BP, blood sugar level,

419
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,690
vitals...

420
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,120
are all stable.

421
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,520
When you have a dangerous surgery,

422
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
you need a great assisting surgeon.

423
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,250
My decisions have always been consistent.

424
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,690
The patient's life.

425
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,720
Let's check his bleeding.

426
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,650
Chairman Kang Il Do, who had announced...

427
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,610
he'd be stepping down,

428
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,150
is in the hospital...

429
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,570
after receiving surgery for lung cancer.

430
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,350
Because of his health scare,

431
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,780
Hyunsung's successorship will likely become of issue.

432
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,570
What a relief.

433
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,970
Hyunsung needs to remain strong...

434
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,390
for the sake of this nation's economy.

435
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,020
Is that right?

436
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,490
The chairman and his sons...

437
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,890
are all patrons of my shop.

438
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,290
That's right.

439
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,690
It's your first time here, isn't it?

440
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,660
I haven't seen you before.

441
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,200
Shops like ours that make custom-made suits...

442
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,520
are all about our regulars.

443
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,490
I'm saying that's how good our quality is,

444
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,320
and that you'll be satisfied.

445
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,450
Because we tailor it...

446
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,100
to fit perfectly on you.

447
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,720
What you sell here...

448
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,290
isn't the clothes.

449
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,220
It's the price of fame, is it not?

450
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,130
- What I meant was...
 -  It doesn't matter,

451
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,890
because that is exactly...

452
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,850
what I want to purchase.

453
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,720
Good job.

454
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,290
It was a tough surgery,

455
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,790
but it was perfect from diagnosis to performance.

456
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,300
Suk Joo,

457
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,390
you are one of the best.

458
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,550
The tumour removal was a success.

459
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,950
When...

460
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,500
can I be discharged?

461
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,020
Are you uncomfortable here?

462
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,190
Just let me know and I...
 -  You.

463
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,790
You make me the most uncomfortable.

464
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,990
I wonder how much you'll brag...

465
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,190
just because you saved my life. Gosh.

466
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,150
Don't tell me...

467
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,820
you see this as an opportunity...

468
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,950
to become the successor...

469
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,970
or claim more shares or anything like that.

470
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,990
Me?

471
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,420
How would I dare...

472
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,650
All you did was play all your life,

473
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,050
but you can't make...

474
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,420
a baby that everyone else does,

475
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,020
just so you won't be inconvenienced.

476
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,990
You are...

477
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,470
really useless.

478
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,790
Let me help you.

479
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,320
Just bring me some water.

480
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,850
Okay.

481
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,190
- Father!
 -  Mr Chairman!

482
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,630
Father, are you all right?

483
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,230
Father. Father?

484
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,390
We removed the tumour,

485
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,720
but...

486
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,990
we may have failed at treating him.

487
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,710
What do you mean by that?

488
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,090
Dr Chae, this is bad.

489
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,490
Chairman Kang...

490
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
The surgery...

491
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,890
went well for sure.

492
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,050
You all saw.

493
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,190
He doesn't have the possible side effects...

494
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,550
of the surgery,

495
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,550
such as bleeding or infarction.

496
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,870
Then why?

497
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,450
Why?

498
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,550
His BP keeps spiking.

499
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,290
He may have...

500
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,920
another insulin shock which may cause brain damage.

501
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,980
Do something.

502
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,430
Open up his head or his chest. Make him breathe.

503
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,290
Just make him breathe!

504
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,920
We have only one option...

505
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,990
left.

506
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,920
Dr Lee Young Oh.

507
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,820
Lee Young Oh?

508
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,830
Not that Lee Young Oh.

509
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,020
Dr Hyun.

510
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,050
I don't approve.

511
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,460
Hyunsung,

512
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,020
with the top physicians...

513
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,220
and top-of-the-line medical equipment,

514
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,820
can't find the cause.

515
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,450
What can Dr Lee Young Oh do?

516
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,620
Dr Lee Young Oh...

517
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,520
was banished by the hospital's ethics council.

518
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,830
We cannot allow it.

519
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,650
He cannot treat patients again.

520
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,430
What did you say?

521
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,140
Antisocial disorder?

522
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,820
You want that psychopath...

523
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,820
to treat my father,

524
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,650
Hyunsung Group's Chairman Kang Il Do...

525
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,290
I'm losing my mind.

526
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,750
His blood sugar level is increasing.

527
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,490
His BP is 220 over 180. It's too high.

528
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,090
We need to do something.

529
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,260
We can't just give him an antihypertensive and wait...

530
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,520
considering his age.

531
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,690
We don't have much time.

532
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,150
Dr Lee will take a completely different approach...

533
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,360
from what we've tried thus far.

534
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,390
Dr Hyun!

535
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,920
Unless there's another reason Dr Lee shouldn't be back,

536
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,130
call him in before it's too late.

537
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,650
Lee Young Oh. Lee Young Oh!

538
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,680
Is he our only option right now?

539
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,690
Dr Lee is...

540
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,490
- too dangerous.
 -  He may be dangerous,

541
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,420
but he'll save the patient's life.

542
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Sir.

543
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,820
Your brother just arrived at the airport.

544
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,180
He's coming straight here.

545
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,190
Darn it!

546
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,690
Call him in.

547
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,480
Sir.

548
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,160
Call him in. Call him in. Call him in now!

549
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,620
Bring Dr Lee to me.

550
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,120
Right now. Bring him here right now!

551
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,690
I'm planning to return to Hyunsung Medical Centre.

552
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,320
Even if you're against it,

553
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,490
you won't be able to stop me this time.

554
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,990
The hospital...

555
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,550
will...

556
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,320
need me.

557
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,450
I won't say that I'm glad to see you again.

558
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,350
I'm not that brazen.

559
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm sure that you have heard about my father...

560
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,550
through the media.

561
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,690
I thought you'd go to see my father first.

562
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,920
Why did you ask to meet me first, Dr Lee?

563
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,990
Did I?

564
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,450
When did I do that?

565
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,090
I made it clear.

566
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,620
Me and you...

567
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,490
and your brother.

568
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,490
I said,

569
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,250
I wanted the three of us to meet.

570
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,090
I was hoping...

571
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,320
that you would tell me...

572
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,590
what my father's illness is before my brother arrives.

573
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,920
("Gender Trouble", "The Broken Image")

574
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,990
You can do that for me.

575
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,720
Let's tell people that it was you...

576
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,250
who didn't show up.

577
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,490
Okay.

578
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
All right.

579
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,620
Now tell me...

580
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,720
what my father is suffering from...

581
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,890
and how you'll treat him.

582
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,950
It's you two...

583
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,220
who must confess.

584
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,060
Even at this moment,

585
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,850
you're killing your father.

586
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,950
Why didn't you tell the doctors...

587
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,020
about the changes in your bodies?

588
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,890
To be exact,

589
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,890
the hereditary disease that Chairman Kang Il Do...

590
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,560
and the two of you have.

591
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,620
The three of you...

592
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,700
are hiding this important fact.

593
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,120
That is why the elite doctors...

594
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,950
at a top-notch hospital like Hyunsung...

595
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,940
couldn't make a diagnosis with the test results alone.

596
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,950
All right.

597
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,090
It's time for you to confess...

598
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,450
if you want to save your father's life.

599
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,560
Hereditary disease?

600
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,150
Do you...

601
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,420
He's being ridiculous.

602
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,790
I don't have any diseases.

603
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
You're well aware...

604
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:30,320
that I love sports and working out.

605
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
Do you...

606
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,250
Are you in good shape?

607
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,340
It's beautiful that you yield to each other.

608
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,850
But we're running out of time. Tick-tock, tick-tock.

609
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,920
While you two remain silent,

610
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,190
your father, Chairman Kang, will pass away...

611
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,990
without getting any proper treatment...

612
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,560
or even a life-saving surgery.

613
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,990
The head of Hyunsung Group...

614
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,920
who can do anything with his power and money...

615
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,350
will die in his own hospital...

616
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,620
because his two sons...

617
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,720
are too proud to reveal their diseases.

618
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,890
If you don't think you can treat him,

619
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,520
you can give up now.

620
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,190
If word gets out about a supposed hereditary disease,

621
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,490
it will affect the group's stock price.

622
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,690
Do you expect us to talk without our attorney present?

623
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,350
I can take Father...

624
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,850
to the States tomorrow.

625
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm sure they have...

626
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,060
physicians of a higher caliber.

627
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,220
- Wait.
 -  I'll leave the discharge procedure to you.

628
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,420
It's not difficult to do.

629
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,560
Your brother just made a choice.

630
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,720
He chose to leave your father to die like this.

631
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,220
That means he wouldn't mind succeeding his father...

632
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,490
with the share of inheritance...

633
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,820
that he's entitled to.

634
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,420
But it's not the same for you.

635
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,790
I know you want to save him.

636
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,850
You must want to desperately.

637
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,820
Because your future depends on it.

638
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,790
Tell me now.

639
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,250
Okay. I'll count to five.

640
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,890
What on earth do you want me to say?

641
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,020
You already told me the answer.

642
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,990
You couldn't look at my fingers.

643
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,620
The youngest son of the Hyunsung family,

644
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,120
the ambitious chairman of the hospital, Kang Hyun Joon.

645
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,590
You are...

646
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,120
turning into a woman.

647
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,720
Isn't that true?

648
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,290
That's nonsense.

649
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,560
I'm a woman?

650
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,790
I'm turning into a woman?

651
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,590
That makes no sense.

652
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,690
All right, then.

653
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,590
Your father will pass away in this bed...

654
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,920
without knowing what disease he has.

655
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,590
You will live as a woman,

656
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,390
and die as a woman.

657
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,560
I should respect...

658
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,990
your decision.

659
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,150
Please save him.

660
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,190
Please save him, Dr Lee.

661
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,590
Please save him.

662
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,920
Tell me whatever you want. What do you want?

663
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,490
I'll give it to you.

664
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,250
What else would a doctor want...

665
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,720
other than saving his patient?

666
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,560
I will return to Hyunsung Medical Centre.

667
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,250
I will return to my original post.

668
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,920
Let's talk about that...

669
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,990
after you save my father.

670
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,950
Did you forget?

671
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
If I choose to treat him,

672
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
it means...

673
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,690
that he will live.

674
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,190
Gosh.

675
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,370
Dr Lee made such a splendid comeback.

676
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,420
I know.

677
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,690
But how did he do that?

678
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,150
Does he really know what disease...

679
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,520
Chairman Kang has and how to treat him?

680
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,920
Whether he gives medication or operates on him,

681
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,320
we'll never know until he wakes up.

682
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,700
Just accept it, Dr Yoo.

683
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,120
He was born talented.

684
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,350
That's what you said to me.

685
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,490
What disease does he have?

686
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,180
Heterogeneous FIPA.

687
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,590
Familial isolated pituitary adenoma.

688
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,060
It's the hereditary disease you and your father have.

689
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,190
In your father's case,

690
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,090
the tumour here is so small...

691
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,060
that no one would have noticed it...

692
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,890
if you hadn't developed the disease.

693
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,620
How on earth...

694
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,520
did you know about this?

695
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,640
A person who loves working out...

696
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,010
avoided using the showers at the gym.

697
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,300
Later on, you avoided the gym altogether.

698
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,820
I assumed that you had your reasons.

699
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,500
At the shop you go to...

700
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,290
that makes custom-tailored suits,

701
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,150
I found out that only your chest size increased.

702
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,720
I was also able to confirm that you lost...

703
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,220
your peripheral vision.

704
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,420
Your chest became abnormally large.

705
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,020
As you can see here,

706
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,690
a sex hormone called prolactin increased.

707
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,190
You've been...

708
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,830
anxious and afraid because...

709
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,890
your body was slowly changing into a woman's body.

710
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,120
I'll operate on you and your father...

711
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,570
for the pituitary adenoma...

712
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,790
simultaneously.

713
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,250
What about my brother?

714
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,450
What about my brother?

715
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,420
There's an exception to everything.

716
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,000
It's the same for hereditary diseases.

717
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,890
This disease is determined by dominant genes.

718
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,690
Your bother didn't develop the disease,

719
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,920
fortunately.

720
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,650
Then, why did you...

721
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,890
make it look like he was hiding it?

722
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,550
By doing so, I knew it would make it easier for you...

723
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,850
to tell me about your condition.

724
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,150
Lee Young Oh.

725
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,920
How dare you?

726
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,090
How could you do that to me?

727
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,620
Did you forget who I am?

728
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,190
I get what I want...

729
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,190
by any means necessary.

730
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,550
I don't care about others' feelings or pain...

731
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,590
because I lack empathy.

732
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,720
I'm a psychopath.

733
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,450
Oh, right.

734
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,620
You and I look alike, don't we?

735
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,820
We look like brothers.

736
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,990
Smile. Come on.

737
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,550
One, two.

738
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,320
I would like you...

739
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,590
to operate on Chairman Kang.

740
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,720
The ethics council at Hyunsung Medical Centre and I...

741
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,290
didn't allow you to come back to the hospital.

742
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,990
You're not allowed to do that surgery, either.

743
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,850
That's why I'm suggesting you do the surgery.

744
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,520
I know you need a good reason.

745
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,550
It must not be that you disobeyed the chairman...

746
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,050
to have me reinstated.

747
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,520
It was for your patient who needed surgery.

748
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,720
You came to a conclusion...

749
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,620
that you had no other choice but to have me reinstated.

750
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,650
I already told you...

751
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,720
that I would return to this hospital...

752
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,090
and you...

753
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,190
wouldn't be able to stop me.

754
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:41,820
(Surgeon: Dr Lee Gun Myung, Patient: Kang Il Do)

755
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,650
(Surgeon: Dr Lee Young Oh, Patient: Kang Hyun Joon)

756
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,220
You were right.

757
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,050
I agreed to this surgery...

758
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,920
only because I need a reason as you said.

759
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,090
Never...

760
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,350
use a patient to achieve your purpose.

761
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,490
Next time, I won't allow you to do that.

762
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,020
I heard...

763
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,190
that you have the same disease that I do.

764
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,290
Thanks to you,

765
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,920
they were able to diagnose me and do the operation.

766
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,650
This is why...

767
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,390
I never approved of you.

768
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,620
If I had been you,

769
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,290
I would've realised this disease...

770
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,850
could make us money right away.

771
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,120
Tell your brother...

772
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,250
to prepare to start...

773
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,690
a bioinformatics...

774
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,920
business.

775
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,390
Are you feeling better?

776
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,280
His surgery went well.

777
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,490
Don't worry.

778
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,550
Haven't we gotten the approval from the FDA?

779
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,470
As soon as it's approved,

780
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,120
we'll announce the commercialisation...

781
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,620
of the regeneration medicine.

782
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,830
Sir.

783
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,790
Before that old man dies,

784
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,220
I have to prove myself to him.

785
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,890
Could that be a lead?

786
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,550
I want to reopen the case of the murders at Hyunsung.

787
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,690
This will only prove that...

788
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,420
there were victims of clinical trials in the process...

789
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,620
of the research conducted by Hyunsung.

790
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,350
We should let the world know.

791
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,990
The public will make this an issue,

792
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,920
and Hyunsung will have to explain.

793
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,620
Then, we'll find out what really happened...

794
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,870
at Hyunsung.

795
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,050
And the police...

796
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,850
will be able to reopen the case.

797
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,390
Suk Joo! Suk Joo!

798
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,790
Suk Joo. This isn't the proper way.

799
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,590
The culture cells...

800
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,090
that were used at the third stage trial...

801
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,190
are very clean.

802
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,850
The immune and tumour responses are clean as well.

803
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,350
Now, look.

804
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,890
Check for yourself.

805
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,350
It can't replace organ transplants just yet.

806
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,020
However,

807
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,620
isn't this definite evidence of cell regeneration?

808
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,190
You can stop worrying now.

809
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,150
Once this gets approved by the FDA,

810
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,820
it can be used for treatments immediately.

811
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,390
Suk Joo, our dream will finally come true!

812
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,020
Come on.

813
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,620
Great job.

814
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,220
Well... Suk Joo.

815
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,820
- Dr Hyun!
 -  What's the matter, Shi Hyun?

816
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,650
Ji An.

817
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,620
Ji An.

818
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,450
- Vaccine.
 -  Come quickly!

819
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,490
Hae Joo.

820
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,450
Where have you been? I've been looking for you!

821
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,590
Dr Hyun.

822
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,650
No, Ji An.

823
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,220
Ji An.

824
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,150
One, two, three, four.

825
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,690
Get the sodium bicarbonate, Ms Lee.

826
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,520
- Ms Jang!
 -  Yes?

827
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,990
Should I congratulate you?

828
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,690
Or should I bid you welcome?

829
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,920
I thought you wouldn't...

830
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,650
be able to treat patients any longer.

831
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,690
That's if you're the person I know.

832
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,520
You wouldn't be able to read...

833
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,190
body signals, either.

834
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,550
Did something happen?

835
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,820
I thought you'd call me earlier, Officer Gye.

836
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,050
Thanks to you,

837
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,950
I may be able to reinvestigate this case.

838
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,350
I'd like to show you...

839
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,350
that there's still a world that cares about the truth.

840
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:36,790
I really hope...

841
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,120
that you'll win this bet.

842
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,420
No.

843
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,950
Ji An, no.

844
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,550
You can live, Ji An.

845
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,190
Dr Hyun!

846
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,320
Dr Hyun.

847
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,350
I'm going to perform a cardiac massage.

848
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,590
It's not too late yet.

849
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,690
It is too late, Dr Hyun.

850
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,850
You know it, too.

851
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,390
Ji An has...

852
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,620
suffered long enough.

853
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,850
Let's send her to her mother's side.

854
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,820
You are so conceited, Hyun Suk Joo.

855
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,640
You always maintain a kind and righteous attitude,

856
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,150
but you can neither save nor heal my daughter.

857
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,390
How dare you judge me? What right do you have?

858
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,590
Suk Joo.

859
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,820
You have to be successful.

860
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,350
Promise me that you'll succeed.

861
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,120
Do you know what my dream is?

862
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,020
I want surgeons to disappear forever.

863
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,890
That way,

864
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,550
there will come a day...

865
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,320
when people can be cured without surgery.

866
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,220
What a surprise.

867
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,620
As long as my heart beats like this,

868
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,950
I will remember...

869
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,090
what a good person you are.

870
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,790
For the first time in human history,

871
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,420
Hyunsung Medical Centre's...

872
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,590
Regenerative Medicine Research Team,

873
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,450
has succeeded in regenerating myocardial cells.

874
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,790
I heard it's impossible to regenerate myocardial cells.

875
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:40,820
Are you certain?

876
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,320
Were all the clinical tests successful?

877
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,190
On the 2nd and 3rd stage clinical trials,

878
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,890
we achieved results that got our patients' attentions.

879
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,220
We safely passed...

880
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,790
all the FDA criteria...

881
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,290
without a problem.

882
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,590
Make sure to fasten your seat belt. All right?

883
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,050
Please drive safely.

884
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,720
(The First Successful Myocardial Cell Regeneration)

885
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,190
He told me that...

886
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,590
he'd help me reinvestigate the case.

887
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,320
I began investigating the case to find...

888
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,050
either the criminal or the one behind the murders,

889
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,850
so that Mr Shin's death would not be in vain.

890
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,590
That's not it.

891
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,920
Mr Shin's death was a mere accident.

892
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,790
It was an unfortunate accident caused by Dr Kim,

893
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,650
a drug addict.

894
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:13,350
This is the fact.

895
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,090
It's the root cause of everything that happened...

896
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,120
at Hyunsung.

897
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,690
This is not...

898
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,650
what I wanted to show you.

899
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,450
You won the bet this time.

900
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:11,490
You do know...

901
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,820
that I am not...

902
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,620
interested in what you're thinking...

903
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,120
or what you're feeling...

904
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,790
at all.

905
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,620
I can't empathise, either.

906
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,960
From now on,

907
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,420
I no longer exist.

908
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,490
You can...

909
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,520
cry as much as you'd like...

910
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,620
right here in front of me.

911
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,960
(Beautiful Mind)

912
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,610
Didn't I tell you it'd be a beautiful knife, Dr Lee?

913
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,220
I've been transferred to the Violent Crimes Division.

914
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,540
I don't want to suspect you.

915
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,290
Say that I made a good decision.

916
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,630
Tell me that our research will be successful!

917
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,210
You were wrong.

918
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,450
As expected, I can't change myself.

919
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,120
I kept thinking to myself on the way here.

920
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,940
I really didn't want to bump in to you.

921
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,020
I didn't know how to face you.
