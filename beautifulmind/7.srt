1
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:08,934
Say hi to Daddy.

2
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:11,764
Hi.

3
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:14,434
How precious.

4
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:19,764
That's a family.

5
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:22,994
A man and woman meet and have a baby.

6
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:27,094
They become parents and raise the child.

7
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:28,794
You must...

8
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,134
live like that someday,

9
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:36,234
so that the world will think you're normal.

10
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,264
Do you understand?

11
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:42,894
Young Oh.

12
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:46,194
Young Oh.

13
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,134
Father.

14
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:50,664
You always say...

15
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,664
if I do as you say,

16
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,364
I can live like other people.

17
00:00:57,764 --> 00:00:58,764
Of course.

18
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:01,164
Then,

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,634
if I try much harder,

20
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,134
can I?

21
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:14,804
Can I someday...

22
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:17,364
be able to feel?

23
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,134
Not pretend,

24
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:22,994
but really feel things...

25
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,134
like normal people.

26
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:27,934
It's late. Let's go.

27
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:53,264
(Beautiful Mind)

28
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:59,180
Hyunsung Group's successorship is making headlines.

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,380
Chairman Kang Il Do held a press conference...

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,947
and stated that they plan to shuffle businesses...

31
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,434
to focus on their next growth engine company...

32
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:11,294
through the transfer of shares of stock.

33
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:15,594
Once the reorganisation is completed this month,

34
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,034
Chairman Kang Il Do will step down...

35
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:21,264
into a supporting role for his successor.

36
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,494
Call Kim Myung Soo and tell him I want to see him...

37
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:31,234
right now.

38
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,164
Within the month?

39
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,064
Is that possible?

40
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:43,764
It has to be.

41
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,564
That is the very reason why I need you.

42
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:53,064
So, you want me to convince the FDA to approve...

43
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:57,970
the stem cell treatment sooner than scheduled?

44
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,034
Stage three trials went smoothly.

45
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,764
There won't be any problems.

46
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,480
The problem is, we don't have much time...

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,864
My point exactly.

48
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:13,694
What's the sudden rush? I need to know, so...

49
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,164
Mr Kim.

50
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,964
You are such a curious person.

51
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:21,906
The health of the citizens is on the line.

52
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:25,734
A small mistake can kill my chances for presidency.

53
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:27,264
Health.

54
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:32,134
The health of the citizens.

55
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:35,064
Health.

56
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,234
Health. That's nice.

57
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:46,664
Hyunsung Bio's DNA treatment brings in 1.5 billion.

58
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:50,894
Hyunsung Medical's digital health devices.

59
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:54,460
A 173-billion-dollar market.

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,834
Hyunsung Tech.

61
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:58,194
Hyunsung Electronics.

62
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,394
And Hyunsung Insurance,

63
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,064
which is in a market...

64
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:06,364
that you can't even calculate its worth.

65
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:15,334
And Hyunsung's growth engine...

66
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:19,064
that my old man can't live without,

67
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,394
which will make...

68
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:25,794
the troublemaker son the successor of Hyunsung Group.

69
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,634
That's what health means...

70
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,004
to me.

71
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:38,364
Now, do you understand...

72
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:40,194
why I'm rushing?

73
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:46,364
Will a week suffice?

74
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,004
You're working so hard for the citizens' health.

75
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:54,234
We can't hold you back because of formalities.

76
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,594
You should go.

77
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:01,264
A week isn't that long.

78
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:05,464
Get the car. Let's head to the FDA.

79
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:20,764
Don't worry too much. It'll go smoothly.

80
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:25,064
It has to. Dr Lee Young Oh is gone.

81
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:30,534
There are no more obstacles to our research.

82
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,794
Are you saying something's wrong with our research?

83
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:40,464
Suk Joo.

84
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:43,080
Strange lesions different from cardiac muscular tissue.

85
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,294
A whole new immune system.

86
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:46,434
Strange tumours that develop out of nowhere.

87
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:49,164
Ki Ho.

88
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:52,994
What would you conclude?

89
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:56,334
Strange lesions and tumours.

90
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:02,234
That's right. Side effects of stem cell treatment.

91
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,764
That's... That's ridiculous.

92
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,194
- Ki Ho.
 -  I...

93
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:13,334
I don't know what you're talking about.

94
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:16,434
No.

95
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,064
You do know.

96
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,194
You fear...

97
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,594
exactly what I fear.

98
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:29,934
Right?

99
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,564
(Petition for Divorce)

100
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:50,294
I slept on a chair in this lab more than at home...

101
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,764
for the past three years that I've been married.

102
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,464
What woman would stay with me?

103
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:58,794
Suk Joo,

104
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,864
you think our research is wrong, right?

105
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:04,694
You know,

106
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:09,234
I never even imagined that.

107
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,134
Because it would be so unfair to me.

108
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,364
Hello.

109
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,934
It's hard dealing with kids, isn't it?

110
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:34,094
That's how kids are.

111
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,264
They don't listen.

112
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:43,794
We have no choice but to tell them until they listen.

113
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:48,464
Like this.

114
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:52,464
Listen carefully.

115
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,294
Our research was perfect through second stage trials.

116
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,564
We've completed stage three trials as well.

117
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:10,094
We've accomplished something that will shock the world.

118
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:12,534
I'm sure the world will be shocked plenty...

119
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,134
just based on...

120
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,934
what you've done thus far.

121
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:20,264
Dr Hyun Suk Joo.

122
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:28,334
Whatever you think, whatever suspicion you may have,

123
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,164
it's fine.

124
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:33,664
However,

125
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,334
can you prove it on your own?

126
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,194
You lack both witnesses and evidence.

127
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:21,864
This patient's heart...

128
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:25,264
had the same rare lesion as Kang Chul Min.

129
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:33,477
You look like you had no idea.

130
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:37,194
Are you really a good doctor?

131
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,777
I heard Dr Shim is in a coma.

132
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:42,964
You seem very interested in her now.

133
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:48,217
Have you become more interested in the lesions on...

134
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:52,964
Kang Chul Min and Dr Kim's daughter's hearts?

135
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,664
This is what they mean...

136
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:05,264
when they say, same pose, different look.

137
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:08,694
Why are you trying to hard?

138
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:12,364
Your greatest rival is gone.

139
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,434
Think about it.

140
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,034
What hospital would take Dr Lee Young Oh?

141
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:20,964
That worries me more.

142
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,604
Even Assemblymen...

143
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,734
become TV personalities if they lose elections.

144
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:31,564
People want characters with a story.

145
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:34,364
Lee Young Oh is definitely a character.

146
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:37,694
- Are you all right?
 -  Dr Lee's contact information?

147
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,604
Yes, please. I need to see him.

148
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:45,364
His address or any other contact information is fine.

149
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:46,994
There's no point.

150
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:51,734
Dr Lee Young Oh will never return...

151
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,294
to Hyunsung or any other hospital.

152
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:57,764
What do you mean?

153
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,894
He can't treat patients any more.

154
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:07,834
His faith that he is perfect shattered...

155
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:09,594
in front of his patient.

156
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,864
I'm telling you so you don't waste your time.

157
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:21,594
They must have dated for a long time, right?

158
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:24,864
She's cruel. So cruel.

159
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:29,694
Dr Kim.

160
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:33,364
You know, don't you?

161
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:36,134
Where is Dr Lee Young Oh?

162
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,594
I need to see him.

163
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,964
For the Dr Lee Young Oh I know,

164
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,234
this hospital...

165
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,534
was the best place for him to hide.

166
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:50,594
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

167
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,464
(Assistant Professor, Kim Min Jae)

168
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,234
A doctor?

169
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,164
He is a doctor.

170
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,194
At Hyunsung Medical Centre, too.

171
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:33,094
Why is he here?

172
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:42,964
It's hot.

173
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,364
A grown man came to a woman's home.

174
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:14,294
Somewhere this far, too.

175
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,464
It's obvious.

176
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,994
You did it. Good job.

177
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:25,513
You were always at the hospital since you were young.

178
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,843
You made it. I can't believe you're dating a doctor.

179
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:30,664
I am not. How many times must I tell you?

180
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:32,734
Then why did you bring him here? People will talk.

181
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:37,464
I see. You want people to talk, so he can't run away.

182
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:40,857
Then just mess around and do the deed.

183
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,534
Messing around is your speciality.

184
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:44,143
Mum always was called in by the principle.

185
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,434
I bet Mum went to school more often than you.

186
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,637
- You punk.
 -  Hey.

187
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:49,634
Not that kind of messing around.

188
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:52,347
I should've known better. What did I expect from you?

189
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,994
You've never kissed a guy, have you?

190
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,464
Have you ever held a guy's hand?

191
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,564
What? You punk.

192
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:00,633
See? Look at that.

193
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,634
You must be really unattractive...

194
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,594
since you're still single.

195
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:06,794
You should repent.

196
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,464
How can you eat? Or sleep?

197
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,350
Get your act together.

198
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,120
You'll get dumped without even holding hands.

199
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,434
Who was that? Your 10-year crush.

200
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,294
You never even told him how you felt...

201
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:20,794
Mum, that's not it.

202
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,094
- It is true.
 -  Hey.

203
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,464
- It is true.
 -  I told you, it is not.

204
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,194
- You liked him.
 -  I've done everything.

205
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,794
- You never told him.
 -  I did all that I could.

206
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,864
- Fine. Fine.
 -  You little!

207
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:30,864
Goodness.

208
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,594
Oh, no.

209
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:40,234
Oh, no.

210
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,910
I'm so sorry. Oh, no.

211
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,934
Hold on.

212
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,694
Of all those things you say you've done,

213
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:50,764
spraying someone with water wasn't one of them.

214
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:54,594
And did you put the blanket on me?

215
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:58,464
I don't know if you're trying to kill me or heal me.

216
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,134
That's not it.

217
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,534
Mum. That's... That's not it.

218
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:16,934
Gosh.

219
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:21,157
I gave you a huge hint this time.

220
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:23,734
It's time you stopped being single.

221
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:38,794
Come on.

222
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:41,594
Brat.

223
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:44,764
Mum.

224
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:48,494
Don't you look down on me.

225
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,534
I may live in the countryside and be old-fashioned,

226
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:57,334
but I'm not unreasonable.

227
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,234
I'm with the times.

228
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,434
Mum, the thing is...

229
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,464
When young people like each other,

230
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,294
they can do that.

231
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:13,964
It's not shameful.

232
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,534
You shouldn't worry about people talking.

233
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,906
Wait.

234
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:22,634
Mum, what... What are you talking about?

235
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:26,003
What's the problem? You can just get married. Right?

236
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:27,580
As long as you get married.

237
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,794
Mum, it's not like that.

238
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:31,764
- Not like what?
 -  What are you saying?

239
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,134
What do you mean?

240
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:34,594
Young Oh!

241
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,564
Young Oh!

242
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,230
You're a doctor, right?

243
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,494
What's wrong with you?

244
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:45,594
Take a look at our neighbour.

245
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:50,764
Oh, my. Why are you alone? Where's your mother?

246
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,564
Don't even mention that evil old woman.

247
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,410
I told you.

248
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,034
She always picked on her, saying she killed her son,

249
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:58,364
and now she's getting revenge.

250
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:01,364
You brat. She'll throw a fit if she finds out.

251
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:03,194
Why did you bring her here?

252
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:04,820
Should I have left her to die?

253
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,164
She left her in the middle of the street this time.

254
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,434
Goodness. That old woman.

255
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:18,950
Maybe the doctor from Seoul could take a look.

256
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,764
I'm sure a big hospital is different.

257
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:23,864
Can you?

258
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,564
Is she...

259
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,764
very ill?

260
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:41,764
Mum, let's take her to a hospital later...

261
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,334
You see,

262
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:48,834
maybe living with a tough mother-in-law was unbearable,

263
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,773
or maybe it was hard living without her husband,

264
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:53,804
but she suddenly stopped talking...

265
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:55,834
and her arms and legs gave out...

266
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,664
and she's been like this for a year now.

267
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,034
Do you think you're superior than the other doctors?

268
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,664
Do you now understand...

269
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:14,164
why I was always against a monster like you...

270
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,234
becoming a doctor?

271
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:23,306
Later. I'll explain later.

272
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,334
What?

273
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:44,634
Do you think Jin Sung loaned him money?

274
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:49,804
Maybe he cons women into giving him money.

275
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:52,494
Who was it?

276
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,764
Who ran off with my belonging?

277
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:58,394
He didn't run off.

278
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:01,434
He felt bad for Gye Sook sitting alone in the street...

279
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,580
so he brought her here.

280
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,594
Stop it.

281
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,834
It's not like it has any value.

282
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:08,834
My gosh.

283
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:14,494
Are you waiting for your husband? You brat.

284
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,864
Don't you lay a hand on her.

285
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,094
I'll call the police on you.

286
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,094
What?

287
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:22,734
You young little runt.

288
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,364
Be good to her.

289
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,796
She's sick.

290
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:28,034
Stop it.

291
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:31,480
Why do you care what I do with my belongings,

292
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,334
whether I boil it or beat it?

293
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:37,234
You'll be punished.

294
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,164
- Stop it.
 -  She's like that because of you.

295
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:41,804
- Stop it.
 -  What?

296
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,534
Oh my gosh.

297
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:53,020
- Wow.
 -  Goodness.

298
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,564
That old fart belongs in the hospital, not Gye Sook.

299
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:58,061
It's tough enough nursing a parent with an illness.

300
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:59,850
It can't be easy taking care of...

301
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,164
your daughter-in-law whom you're not even related to.

302
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,434
I'm sure every day is torture.

303
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:07,194
Goodness.

304
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:15,264
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

305
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:16,994
My brother...

306
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:20,013
must have really wanted to help.

307
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,734
That's how everyone here lives.

308
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:24,494
Whether or not you're family, you're not strangers.

309
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:27,137
I think his desire to help her blinded him...

310
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:29,034
regarding how awkward it would be for you.

311
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:36,334
So?

312
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,464
Is that why you brought me here?

313
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:41,194
Is that why you brought me...

314
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,247
to this tiny Oceanside town...

315
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:46,764
where everyone helps and loves each other...

316
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:49,434
as if they were all family?

317
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:53,594
Did you hope my rotten heart would heal?

318
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:59,064
I wanted to let you rest somewhere...

319
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,394
where people didn't look at you differently.

320
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:06,074
I only thought about helping, just like my brother.

321
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,094
You didn't want to help, but rather, confirm.

322
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,650
"I hurt less than you."

323
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,450
"I'm happier than you."

324
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,734
"I have the power to help you."

325
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,494
"Thus, I am superior to you."

326
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:23,994
With your nose in the air.

327
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:28,634
People always want confirmation and comfort...

328
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:30,310
when others are in pain.

329
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,794
Love, friendship, pity.

330
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:37,203
Those are nothing more than a cheap relay of signals...

331
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:39,380
that people use as they need it...

332
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,537
by calling it a different name.

333
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:43,934
That's how people are.

334
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:49,464
Normal people who take pride in feeling emotions.

335
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:59,494
You're this angry because of yourself, right?

336
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:06,764
You're angry at yourself...

337
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,494
for being afraid and running away from a patient.

338
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,764
Because you're afraid you'll keep running.

339
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:20,764
This is how people are.

340
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:25,994
That is why people can never help others.

341
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:31,000
The other person's weakness becomes...

342
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,134
a sweet sore spot that you can attack...

343
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:36,934
or a disgusting burden...

344
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:40,934
that you want to throw out if no one were looking.

345
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,434
Take back your request for help.

346
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:54,920
She made her choice...

347
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,564
regardless of whether someone sees her or not.

348
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,494
Do you want to make a bet?

349
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,764
What are you trying to pull?

350
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,694
Why did you go so far?

351
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:45,834
Did you want to risk your life?

352
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,134
What are you trying to show me?

353
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:51,894
I said let's make a bet.

354
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,764
I wanted to show you...

355
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,494
that in the world I know,

356
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:03,434
Granny isn't such a bad person...

357
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:06,034
that she'd kill her sick daughter-in-law.

358
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:11,664
Why don't you...

359
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,794
treat her if you aren't afraid of treating patients?

360
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:21,694
If she starts to talk, we'll know then...

361
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:26,434
whether you're right, or I'm right.

362
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:30,864
- Congratulations.
 -  Congratulations.

363
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,450
- Applause.
 -  Applause.

364
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,494
Applause.

365
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,594
My daughter. You've been so brave.

366
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:42,034
Don't cry. This is a good day.

367
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:45,634
Young Joon is starting a new, healthy life.

368
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:48,034
Please take good care of her.

369
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,164
Her temperature, BP and allergic reaction...

370
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:52,364
all look good.

371
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:55,434
We can operate as planned.

372
00:25:56,194 --> 00:25:58,564
- Where's the extraction team?
 -  They're en route.

373
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,634
They're on the train.

374
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:09,664
Isn't there a way?

375
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:12,464
We need to get there in 30 minutes.

376
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:16,134
I don't know. There must be an accident.

377
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,134
I'm losing my mind.

378
00:26:19,864 --> 00:26:22,034
Hey look up the fastest route.

379
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:26,464
Do you think others haven't searched?

380
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:29,864
There's no special fast route just for us.

381
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:31,894
- Even Alpha Go can't find it.
 -  Dr Yang.

382
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:35,834
If we don't arrive in 30 minutes, the heart is useless.

383
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:38,294
Then the patient waiting in the OR...

384
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,394
- Die already.
 -  Dr Yang!

385
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:46,464
Why...

386
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,634
did you sign up for the extraction team?

387
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:52,164
Helicopter.

388
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:55,480
- What?
 -  You see that in dramas.

389
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,734
The extraction team rides helicopters...

390
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:00,464
and land on hospital rooftops. It's so cool.

391
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,134
I didn't know we'd take the train to Daejeon.

392
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,764
Why do you think I came with you today?

393
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:09,864
Because you're off today?

394
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:13,364
Because you get paid overtime, which you love?

395
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:14,694
In case...

396
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,694
you kill a person.

397
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:22,434
In case you stick your neurosurgeon nose in the air...

398
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:25,264
and declare someone brain dead without hesitation.

399
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,820
Or in case you delay declaring someone brain dead...

400
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,034
and patients who needed organ transplants die.

401
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:34,364
That is why I came with you, to try to teach you.

402
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,334
Don't be a quack. Be a real doctor, punk.

403
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,470
Hi, Dr Lee Shi Hyun. We're stuck in traffic.

404
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,480
There must have been an accident.

405
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,694
We're stuck.

406
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,667
You must be stressed out.

407
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,394
I heard it's your first transplant surgery.

408
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,584
- Hey. What are you doing?
 -  What?

409
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:07,020
- What are you doing?
 -  I know a shortcut.

410
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,134
Fire!

411
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,034
Excuse me.

412
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:42,894
Excuse me. Excuse me.

413
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:44,434
Excuse me.

414
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:50,534
He is such a nag.

415
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,234
All he had to say was "Lee Shi Hyun".

416
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:08,034
The heart that I'm receiving...

417
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,903
Was it from a woman or a man?

418
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:15,134
It's against policy to tell you.

419
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:17,216
Don't worry about it.

420
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:20,560
What if my heart starts to pound one day...

421
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,664
when I see a woman on the street?

422
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:27,394
And it turns out you have her dead lover's heart?

423
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:31,140
You must have learned about love from soap operas...

424
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,106
while you were in the hospital.

425
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,713
Tell me if your heart races when you see a pretty girl.

426
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:38,994
That's an irregular heartbeat. You'll need medicine.

427
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:42,734
You must have learned about love in books.

428
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:46,794
Careful.

429
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:58,734
So, what do you want to do first after surgery?

430
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,434
Something you couldn't do before. Date?

431
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,594
I definitely want a boyfriend.

432
00:30:07,094 --> 00:30:09,294
I want to ride a roller coaster with him.

433
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:14,480
I want to scream with my boyfriend and ride it...

434
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,934
100 times from dusk till dawn.

435
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:21,034
And I want to go clubbing without telling him.

436
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:24,594
I seem so pathetic,

437
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:26,934
don't I?

438
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:34,364
To be honest, I didn't plan anything.

439
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:39,794
For years, I've had only one dream.

440
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:43,434
That dream is coming true today.

441
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,094
I don't need a boyfriend.

442
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:52,294
I don't need roller coasters or clubs.

443
00:30:53,594 --> 00:30:56,034
I don't need to wait for a transplant any more.

444
00:30:57,234 --> 00:31:00,564
I won't hold my breath every time the phone rings.

445
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:06,234
On the waiting list, I went from 173 to 1...

446
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,194
in four years.

447
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:12,564
Do you know something?

448
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:16,264
In our OR, transplants aren't even considered surgery.

449
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:17,934
Because it's so simple.

450
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:20,734
Connect the blood vessels, and you're done.

451
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:24,934
It won't be pretty though.

452
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:28,934
But I will make it strong,

453
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:33,134
so that it won't shake after 100 roller coaster rides.

454
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:10,464
I'll see you later.

455
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:23,194
What are you doing?

456
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:27,764
What?

457
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,864
I feel like my heart will explode because of you.

458
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:35,840
I ran...

459
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,694
from the intersection to the hospital...

460
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:40,094
with the heart for your patient.

461
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:41,594
You should...

462
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,437
buy me a meal or a drink.

463
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:45,577
Why should I?

464
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:48,264
Wait. I deserve a reward.

465
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:51,630
I feel like I'm going to pass out,

466
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,664
it's hard to breathe and my lips are dry.

467
00:32:53,664 --> 00:32:54,764
- And I...
 -  So what?

468
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,934
My patient felt that way for the past four years.

469
00:33:01,264 --> 00:33:03,594
Do you really want to take credit? Shame on you.

470
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:06,494
That's not...

471
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:09,464
Dr Yang.

472
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:10,894
Yes?

473
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:12,594
Have you seen Dr Hyun Suk Joo?

474
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:15,570
He promised to assist with the surgery.

475
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,264
I haven't seen him.

476
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:35,634
Is there any way...

477
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:38,150
to contact Dr Lee Young Oh?

478
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,264
What is it about?

479
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:42,857
Did he do anything wrong to you?

480
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:43,964
Dr Lee is...

481
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:46,564
the first person who made me feel ashamed.

482
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,494
I guess something happened between you two.

483
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,734
Is it related to hospital affairs?

484
00:33:58,534 --> 00:33:59,664
Do tell.

485
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:03,237
What happened?

486
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:04,864
The person who can answer that question is...

487
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:07,434
Dr Lee, not me.

488
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:11,340
That's why I need to see him.

489
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,764
I'm looking for my son just like you.

490
00:34:15,204 --> 00:34:17,064
Are you going to blame me for being a bad parent?

491
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,994
- Then...
 -  I'll tell him to call you when he's back.

492
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,934
Because I really need to know...

493
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,134
why you're looking for Dr Lee.

494
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:30,064
I'll count on you.

495
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,234
Don't you regret?

496
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,594
That you threw out your family,

497
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:43,734
Dr Lee Young Oh...

498
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,064
to be faithful to your principles.

499
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,764
You must be very concerned, Dr Hyun.

500
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:31,534
It's me.

501
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,064
Haven't you found my son yet?

502
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:06,034
Are you her guardian?

503
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:09,834
You don't need to worry.

504
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:12,594
She has a mild fever.

505
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,367
She wasn't under the water for that long,

506
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:18,204
so it doesn't seem like there's water in her lungs.

507
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:20,834
I'm sure you're aware that she had a stroke.

508
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:25,176
We need to run some tests on her,

509
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:27,443
so I requested a transfer to a bigger hospital.

510
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:28,564
That's all you need to know for now.

511
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:37,634
Who are you?

512
00:36:55,294 --> 00:36:57,564
She swore at her daughter-in-law all the time.

513
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:59,734
She put her daughter-in-law in danger after all.

514
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:03,340
There's no way she did such a horrible thing to her.

515
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,934
They've lived together for a long time.

516
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,264
We all know it's been a nightmare for her.

517
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,464
It's obvious.

518
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:12,534
She pushed a woman into the sea.

519
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,264
That means she tried to kill her.

520
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,064
I saw everything.

521
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:18,200
She pushed the wheelchair like this...

522
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,480
I don't even need to explain this.

523
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,764
Why else did she run away? She's not at home.

524
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:22,864
Is she not at home?

525
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:26,034
Shouldn't we report her to the police?

526
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:28,564
Where is Jin Sung?

527
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,964
Her hair is thin and weak.

528
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,034
Her skin is dry.

529
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:19,564
Her neck is abnormally thick.

530
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:22,334
She seems to have gained weight suddenly.

531
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:24,894
She's suffering from long-term paralysis.

532
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:27,494
Also, she has lost mobility.

533
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:35,064
Can you hear me?

534
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:36,734
Listen to me carefully.

535
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:39,634
The person who pushed you into the water...

536
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:41,764
is your mother-in-law, right?

537
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,294
You can tell me.

538
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:46,764
If not,

539
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:49,464
there's no way to explain your condition.

540
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,434
She can't seem to speak.

541
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:57,564
She swallows saliva instead of answering.

542
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,394
- It means...
 -  Raised eyebrows.

543
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,734
Wrinkled nose. Stepping backwards.

544
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:05,964
Those indicate contempt and fear.

545
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,164
You're trying to read my body signals.

546
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:34,704
Hello.

547
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,173
She did?

548
00:40:38,173 --> 00:40:39,364
Yes.

549
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:43,534
My goodness. I don't know what's going on.

550
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:47,720
Gosh. Ma'am, are you saying...

551
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,043
you pushed your daughter-in-law into the sea?

552
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:52,734
You pushed her wheelchair like this, right?

553
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:56,734
Ma'am!

554
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:59,564
Were you trying to kill her?

555
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:19,334
Granny...

556
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:21,534
just turned herself in.

557
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:27,494
That means...

558
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:30,294
my diagnosis...

559
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:33,264
was correct.

560
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:35,934
So I won...

561
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:38,334
the bet...

562
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:40,094
as I expected.

563
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,534
I'll get her started on an IV before she's transferred.

564
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:53,234
Hey.

565
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:56,264
A pen, please.

566
00:42:02,034 --> 00:42:04,247
This patient isn't suffering from a stroke.

567
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:05,534
Sure.

568
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:10,237
- Pardon?
 -  She's suffering from...

569
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,734
Hashimoto's disease.

570
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:14,764
Advise the doctors at the hospital she'll go to...

571
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:18,064
to begin with a hormone treatment.

572
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,494
One more thing.

573
00:42:21,094 --> 00:42:25,020
This patient will recover very slowly.

574
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,100
But I assume that it won't be easy...

575
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,634
for them to live together like a family.

576
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:33,364
Excuse me.

577
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,064
- I asked you earlier. Who are you?
 -  If I were you,

578
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:39,764
I would never tell a patient's guardian...

579
00:42:40,264 --> 00:42:42,164
what I hope for the patient.

580
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:44,664
I would never say that her lungs were fine...

581
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:46,603
when she had a fever,

582
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:49,130
like you did to me earlier.

583
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,434
I would never do that.

584
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:59,840
Oh, no. Hold on.

585
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,110
What's wrong with her? What is happening to her?

586
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,164
Pen light. Pen light!

587
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,334
What's the matter?

588
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:18,050
- Do something.
 -  I can't.

589
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,064
I just graduated from medical school.

590
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:22,334
She needs to go to a bigger hospital.

591
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,464
- Why isn't the ambulance coming?
 -  Wait.

592
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:28,634
Was I wrong?

593
00:43:29,534 --> 00:43:32,134
No. I wasn't wrong this time, either.

594
00:43:34,564 --> 00:43:35,794
There must be something.

595
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,204
There must be.

596
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:44,464
Dr Lee Young Oh.

597
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:47,094
Wait, Dr Lee!

598
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:09,794
Metzenbaum.

599
00:44:12,494 --> 00:44:13,794
I'll remove the heart.

600
00:44:14,364 --> 00:44:15,464
Hold on.

601
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:22,994
The heart is okay, isn't it?

602
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:26,064
The hospital checked the heart before sending it,

603
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,894
and the extraction team arrived on time.

604
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,194
It developed infective endocarditis inside the valve.

605
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:44,834
We can't use this heart.

606
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:57,664
We can treat the infection after the transplant.

607
00:44:58,634 --> 00:44:59,894
We can do that.

608
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:03,334
I'll look after her through the night by myself.

609
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:04,634
I can pull this off.

610
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:06,064
Pull yourself together, Lee Shi Hyun!

611
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:08,194
Even if you transplant this heart,

612
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:10,294
will that be all?

613
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:12,334
You can't treat the infection...

614
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,834
while using immunosuppressants.

615
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:14,980
That's basic knowledge.

616
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,094
This patient might not...

617
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:19,394
be able to survive waiting for another donor...

618
00:45:19,394 --> 00:45:21,564
- with her heart.
 -  Without her heart,

619
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:24,734
she'll die right now.

620
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:30,394
Is that what you want?

621
00:45:37,964 --> 00:45:38,994
Suction.

622
00:45:40,264 --> 00:45:41,364
Suction.

623
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:52,764
Doctor.

624
00:45:58,094 --> 00:46:01,564
Something's wrong with my heart.

625
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,234
Why is it pounding?

626
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,464
Are you okay?

627
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,064
I get it.

628
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:17,364
It's because I'm in front of a pretty woman.

629
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:22,634
I guess...

630
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:27,634
it was a man who gave me this heart.

631
00:46:29,794 --> 00:46:33,294
A very healthy man.

632
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:39,894
Thank you, Doctor.

633
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,134
Dr Hyun.

634
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:22,434
I tried my best to save her life.

635
00:47:23,064 --> 00:47:24,634
But no matter how hard I try,

636
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:28,494
there's nothing I can do for her.

637
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:32,894
How much longer do I have to fight this fight?

638
00:47:35,194 --> 00:47:36,294
Still,

639
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:39,734
I would choose to fight it every day...

640
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:42,294
until the end.

641
00:47:58,594 --> 00:48:01,694
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your handkerchief?

642
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:04,064
Thank you. I'll give it back later.

643
00:48:43,794 --> 00:48:45,464
I couldn't just go home.

644
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,664
It was my first surgery, too.

645
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:58,964
It was my first surgery as a professor.

646
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:04,564
I feel terrible.

647
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:11,964
Dr Hong.

648
00:49:14,194 --> 00:49:18,034
We all knew that you'd get the promotion.

649
00:49:19,634 --> 00:49:22,264
You're short-tempered and foul-mouthed.

650
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,464
You're perfect for Anaesthesiology.

651
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,094
I'm going through a hard time lately.

652
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:32,134
I can't release my anger.

653
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:36,850
I wish I could swear saying how an anaesthesiologist...

654
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:40,164
could do that and let it go, but I can't.

655
00:49:41,764 --> 00:49:43,964
I wish I could yell as much as I want...

656
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:46,494
saying that it's not right, but I can't do that.

657
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:50,664
Gosh.

658
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,134
I guess that's why I miss her.

659
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:02,934
Dr Kim Yoon Kyung.

660
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:08,264
I'll get going.

661
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:30,047
Was there a little child involved in the accident?

662
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:31,313
Is there a little child?

663
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:34,394
Is there any child who can give my daughter a heart?

664
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:38,594
Suk Joo, you must succeed.

665
00:50:39,464 --> 00:50:41,734
Promise me that you'll succeed.

666
00:50:44,564 --> 00:50:46,164
I heard about the surgery.

667
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:51,994
You gave up on the transplant during the surgery.

668
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:57,164
He can be cruel sometimes, Dr Hyun.

669
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:02,964
The Creator isn't exactly generous.

670
00:51:03,634 --> 00:51:06,564
We can live even if we give half of our liver away.

671
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,064
The fingernails grow back when we trim them.

672
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:15,564
However, the brain and the heart are the more crucial,

673
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:18,594
but they can't be regenerated once they're damaged.

674
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:24,764
Must I hear more of this?

675
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:32,034
Do you really need to find Dr Lee Young Oh?

676
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:34,194
What can be done now?

677
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,634
We'll be getting the approval from the FDA soon.

678
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,247
Once we succeed in regenerative medicine,

679
00:51:43,247 --> 00:51:45,164
we won't need to worry about transplants.

680
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,974
No one would have to go through...

681
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:49,694
what Dr Kim had to go through.

682
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:52,994
If you wait just a bit longer, regenerative medicine...

683
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:55,594
- will replace the Creator's job.
 -  Tell him...

684
00:52:00,394 --> 00:52:01,834
that you're a scumbag.

685
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:21,894
Are you all right?

686
00:52:24,294 --> 00:52:25,364
I lost...

687
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:27,934
this bet.

688
00:52:32,464 --> 00:52:35,564
I wasn't able to diagnose her properly.

689
00:52:37,094 --> 00:52:38,094
I couldn't...

690
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:41,894
read the patient's mind any further.

691
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:50,594
Are you satisfied now?

692
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,934
If it wasn't Granny who pushed her into the sea,

693
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:00,964
what happens?

694
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:09,564
This is why she was being so nasty and stubborn.

695
00:53:10,464 --> 00:53:12,464
This is why she tried so hard to make money.

696
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:16,894
Her daughter-in-law wasn't a burden for her...

697
00:53:18,464 --> 00:53:20,294
to get rid of.

698
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,764
She was the future that pushed her to work harder.

699
00:53:25,094 --> 00:53:26,134
There is no one...

700
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:28,534
who would throw away...

701
00:53:29,994 --> 00:53:31,064
the future into the sea.

702
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:34,234
Didn't you have a moment...

703
00:53:35,464 --> 00:53:38,264
when you desperately needed someone...

704
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:43,194
although you knew they wouldn't be of any help?

705
00:54:05,334 --> 00:54:06,994
We're making the transfer right now.

706
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:17,934
It wasn't the granny who pushed her.

707
00:54:18,664 --> 00:54:21,634
We'll know more when we run more tests,

708
00:54:22,164 --> 00:54:25,494
but it seems she's suffering from cerebral haemorrhage.

709
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:28,594
She needs to undergo emergency surgery.

710
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:31,326
Are you her guardian?

711
00:54:31,326 --> 00:54:32,334
No.

712
00:54:32,764 --> 00:54:34,664
It's not a stroke and also not cerebral haemorrhage.

713
00:54:35,194 --> 00:54:37,234
What she needs before anything...

714
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:38,834
is immunosuppressants,

715
00:54:39,494 --> 00:54:40,634
not surgery.

716
00:54:40,964 --> 00:54:42,834
Who are you?

717
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:46,206
Paralysis, loss of speaking skills, unconscious.

718
00:54:46,206 --> 00:54:47,820
They're all symptoms of a stroke.

719
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,764
She fell into the sea and the external shock...

720
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:50,980
caused a vessel to rupture.

721
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,034
She fell into the sea,

722
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:54,064
so it's not cerebrovascular problem.

723
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:56,494
She jumped into the sea herself.

724
00:54:58,864 --> 00:54:59,864
Look.

725
00:55:10,094 --> 00:55:11,264
That doesn't make any sense.

726
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:14,370
Why would she do that?

727
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,664
She was hallucinating.

728
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:18,464
- Hallucination?
 -  She constantly had hot flashes.

729
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:21,864
She was hallucinating that someone set her on fire.

730
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:23,664
That is why...

731
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:26,350
she fell into water to survive.

732
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,743
How would you know that?

733
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:29,994
She can't even speak.

734
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,464
It wasn't about the medical symptoms.

735
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,464
I tried to read the patient's mind...

736
00:55:36,364 --> 00:55:37,464
for the first time.

737
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:42,234
I tried to see her as a human being.

738
00:55:45,564 --> 00:55:47,334
It has similar symptoms as a stroke,

739
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:49,634
but she was hallucinating.

740
00:55:50,094 --> 00:55:51,564
That proves that she doesn't have a stroke.

741
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:54,234
Her autoantibody...

742
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:58,034
targeted her brain. She has autoimmune encephalitis.

743
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,234
This patient has...

744
00:56:00,934 --> 00:56:02,694
autoimmune encephalitis accompanied with...

745
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:06,413
Hashimoto's disease.

746
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:10,894
Are you saying that my diagnosis was incorrect?

747
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:15,070
Don't just stand there. The hospital is two hours away.

748
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,534
She may not make it in time for surgery.

749
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:20,464
Where do you keep the immunosuppressants?

750
00:56:21,894 --> 00:56:23,394
Are you trying to kill the patient?

751
00:56:24,734 --> 00:56:25,864
I need immunosuppressants!

752
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:28,520
If she dies before she gets to the OR,

753
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,234
you'll be sent to military camp right away.

754
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:34,664
I'm a police officer.

755
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:37,587
Article 12 of the Emergency Medical Service Act says...

756
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:38,594
no one may interfere...

757
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:40,394
with an emergency medical team treating a patient.

758
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:42,994
This is an emergency situation.

759
00:56:44,094 --> 00:56:45,264
From this moment on,

760
00:56:46,734 --> 00:56:47,834
nobody can interrupt...

761
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:50,294
this doctor.

762
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:54,864
Where are immunosuppressants?

763
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:57,294
Where?

764
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:07,237
What do you think you're doing?

765
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:09,294
She needs an operation.

766
00:57:09,294 --> 00:57:10,734
Why are you giving her immunosuppressants?

767
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,634
Are you trying to kill this patient?

768
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:14,013
- Hold on.
 -  Wait a second!

769
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,034
Hold on.

770
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:23,634
Are you out of your mind?

771
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:26,364
Do you realise what you've just done?

772
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,894
Oh, my. Doctor.

773
00:57:52,664 --> 00:57:53,664
Mother.

774
00:57:55,894 --> 00:57:58,494
Where is my mother-in-law?

775
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:08,064
I was right.

776
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:15,734
I was right.

777
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,734
Why did you turn yourself in?

778
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:42,064
Gosh.

779
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:47,534
The police officers have enough on their hands.

780
00:58:48,294 --> 00:58:51,334
People would think you were senile.

781
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:58,164
I was afraid she did that to run away from me.

782
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:05,264
Once I'm gone, the government will look after her.

783
00:59:05,264 --> 00:59:07,234
She'll be sent to a facility, right?

784
00:59:10,064 --> 00:59:12,334
I wanted her to live like that...

785
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:14,294
without having to deal with me.

786
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:21,034
I see you gave it some thought.

787
00:59:22,494 --> 00:59:25,494
Did my daughter-in-law really ask for me?

788
00:59:26,234 --> 00:59:27,264
My gosh.

789
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:36,494
Who was that...

790
00:59:37,694 --> 00:59:38,994
earlier?

791
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,864
The doctor who saved me...

792
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:44,864
Oh, well...

793
00:59:45,694 --> 00:59:48,334
I assume you don't mean me, right?

794
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:51,964
Should I go bring him?

795
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,034
I won...

796
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:06,894
the bet.

797
01:01:09,364 --> 01:01:12,294
You also believed Granny's sincerity.

798
01:01:13,064 --> 01:01:15,267
That's how your diagnosis was accurate.

799
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:16,294
Did you bring me here...

800
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:20,234
to tell me that?

801
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:23,834
Not a chance.

802
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:27,494
A human's body never lies.

803
01:01:29,764 --> 01:01:31,164
The world I live in...

804
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:35,534
is a perfectly logical place...

805
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,894
that isn't polluted by emotions or sincerity.

806
01:01:42,134 --> 01:01:43,264
That is why...

807
01:01:44,464 --> 01:01:45,964
I still love medicine.

808
01:01:51,934 --> 01:01:52,964
Still?

809
01:01:54,394 --> 01:01:55,594
You asked me earlier...

810
01:01:56,534 --> 01:01:59,134
if I needed someone desperately...

811
01:01:59,694 --> 01:02:01,694
although he won't be of any help.

812
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:06,434
I did.

813
01:02:07,094 --> 01:02:08,264
But...

814
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:13,934
it wasn't as bad as I expected.

815
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:23,034
This is where you were.

816
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:25,494
The patient is asking for you.

817
01:02:28,034 --> 01:02:29,364
Excuse me.

818
01:02:30,294 --> 01:02:33,234
You're a real doctor, right?

819
01:02:35,064 --> 01:02:37,364
Which hospital are you with?

820
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,634
I'm Lee Young Oh.

821
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:52,234
I'm a doctor.

822
01:02:53,764 --> 01:02:55,894
I'm Doctor Lee Young Oh.

823
01:03:18,734 --> 01:03:21,464
(Beautiful Mind)

824
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,820
Dr Lee? Are you really Dr Lee Young Oh?

825
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,894
- Sir!
 -  Father!

826
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:30,934
What is wrong with all of you? Do something!

827
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:34,520
Without a proper diagnosis, the risk is too high.

828
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,150
Your father is going to pass away.

829
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,764
- It's too late.
 -  You're wrong. It's not too late.

830
01:03:40,464 --> 01:03:42,564
Dr Lee is way too dangerous.

831
01:03:42,564 --> 01:03:43,894
I'm planning to return to Hyunsung Medical Centre.

832
01:03:43,894 --> 01:03:46,664
It's where I used to belong. Do you want to bet?

833
01:03:46,664 --> 01:03:50,164
I really hope that you will win this bet.
