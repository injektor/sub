<font color="yellow">Stop this.</font>

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,880
<font color="yellow">It's too dangerous.</font>

<font color="yellow">If you go through with the surgery,</font>

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,350

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,250
<font color="yellow">Must you go through with that illegal surgery?</font>

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,310
<font color="yellow">Can you handle it?</font>

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,950
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it forever.</font>

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,510
<font color="yellow">I'm against it.</font>

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,780
<font color="yellow">As a doctor,</font>

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,450
<font color="yellow">I can't permit you doing something so reckless.</font>

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,250
<font color="yellow">As your father,</font>

15

<font color="yellow">I can't permit...</font>

<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,550
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel.</font>

<font color="yellow">How you felt that day when you took me...</font>

<font color="yellow">into the OR...</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,320
<font color="yellow">We will begin the stem cell implantation surgery...</font>

25
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,350
<font color="yellow">on Gye Jin Sung starting tonight. I'll check on her.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

28
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,410
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang. Where did Ms Gye Jin Sung go?</font>

29
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,510
<font color="yellow">I think she's getting a CT scan on her lungs.</font>

30
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,210
<font color="yellow">I see. Okay.</font>

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,510
<font color="yellow">She just left after getting her CT scan taken.</font>

32
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,780
<font color="yellow">Maybe they took her to Dr Hyun's office...</font>

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,250
<font color="yellow">for examination?</font>

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,310
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,950
<font color="yellow">- Dr Hong? - Yes?</font>

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,580
<font color="yellow">Take a look at this.</font>

37
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,750
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

38
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,910
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

39
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,550
<font color="yellow">any of them are candidates for stem cell implants?</font>

40
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,510
<font color="yellow">- I'm in a rush right now... - Hey.</font>

41
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,680
<font color="yellow">- Is it more urgent than their lives? - No, but...</font>

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
<font color="yellow">Take a look.</font>

43
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,410
<font color="yellow">Look closely. Sit down.</font>

44
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,550
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

45
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,210
<font color="yellow">Look closely...</font>

46
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,050
<font color="yellow">and tell me what you think as a specialist.</font>

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,110
<font color="yellow">I really...</font>

48
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,910
<font color="yellow">You're good at things like this.</font>

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,080
<font color="yellow">- But... - Just take a look.</font>

50
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,550
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

51
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,650
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you again.</font>

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,010
<font color="yellow">Lung transplants from live donors...</font>

53
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,780
<font color="yellow">are illegal because it endangers the life of the donor.</font>

54
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,810
<font color="yellow">Do you still want to do this?</font>

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,580
<font color="yellow">It is illegal...</font>

56
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,780
<font color="yellow">and very dangerous,</font>

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,050
<font color="yellow">but it has a high rate of survival...</font>

58
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,580
<font color="yellow">for the patient.</font>

59
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,780
<font color="yellow">That is my favourite type of surgery.</font>

60
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,810
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

61
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,650
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Dr Hyun?</font>

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,120
<font color="yellow">- I have. - You have?</font>

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,280
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Where is he?</font>

64
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,650
<font color="yellow">- Come with me. - Okay.</font>

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,980
<font color="yellow">- Oh, that's right. - What?</font>

66
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,950
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

67
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,380
<font color="yellow">Why are we going to the lecture hall?</font>

68
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,910
<font color="yellow">I thought he was here.</font>

69
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,450
<font color="yellow">Maybe not.</font>

70
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,580
<font color="yellow">- Dr Yang. - Yes?</font>

71
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,650
<font color="yellow">Yang Sung Eun!</font>

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,180
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

73
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,380
<font color="yellow">Are you sure Dr Hyun is here?</font>

74
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,010
<font color="yellow">Hyun... Dr Hyun Suk Joo?</font>

75
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

76
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,410
<font color="yellow">I got confused with Dr Hyun of Pathology.</font>

77
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,910
<font color="yellow">- I'm so sorry. - You...</font>

78
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,910
<font color="yellow">You'll pay for this.</font>

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,250
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. Doctor. Doctor!</font>

80
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,750
<font color="yellow">Doctor! I'm sorry!</font>

81
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,950
<font color="yellow">Doctor! I'm very sorry!</font>

82
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,050
<font color="yellow">They'll buy us time.</font>

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,010
<font color="yellow">Once this surgery is over,</font>

84
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,250
<font color="yellow">we will have to take...</font>

85
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,280
<font color="yellow">Responsibility for this illegal surgery.</font>

86
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,450
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun.</font>

87
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,910
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking the courage.</font>

88
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

89
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,410
<font color="yellow">Shall we begin?</font>

90
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,180
<font color="yellow">Sir, we're in trouble.</font>

91
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,180
<font color="yellow">As you can see,</font>

92
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,080
<font color="yellow">our hospital's PR regarding stents is insufficient.</font>

93
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,050
<font color="yellow">Namin Hospital's second and...</font>

94
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,610
<font color="yellow">fourth quarter figures aren't as high as ours,</font>

95
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,910
<font color="yellow">but people think they are the leaders with regard...</font>

96
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,610
<font color="yellow">to stents for the heart.</font>

97
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,650
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll review it.</font>

98
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,880
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

99
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,780
<font color="yellow">If you review and then give orders, a month will pass.</font>

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,680
<font color="yellow">I'd appreciate it if you'd review it now...</font>

101
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,550
<font color="yellow">and give your instructions right away.</font>

102
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,110
<font color="yellow">Sir. I can't find Gye Jin Sung or Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

103
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,010
<font color="yellow">- What? - It's been a while already.</font>

104
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,710
<font color="yellow">I can't find them anywhere.</font>

105
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,810
<font color="yellow">Sir, can't you approve this first before you go?</font>

106
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,610
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you today?</font>

107
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,010
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - But this is...</font>

108
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,780
<font color="yellow">important for the hospital's...</font>

109
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,350
<font color="yellow">performance...</font>

110
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,950
<font color="yellow">You want us to do what?</font>

111
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,550
<font color="yellow">Please buy us time, so that Mr Chae...</font>

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,380
<font color="yellow">can't interfere...</font>

113
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,910
<font color="yellow">with what we want to do.</font>

114
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,410
<font color="yellow">Mr Chae? Why?</font>

115
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,410
<font color="yellow">You want us to do something that dangerous?</font>

116
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,610
<font color="yellow">Just because there are five of us...</font>

117
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,810
<font color="yellow">doesn't mean we're the Power Rangers.</font>

118
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

119
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,610

<font color="yellow">Jang Bae.</font>

125
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,810
<font color="yellow">You started this,</font>

126
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,010
<font color="yellow">so please,</font>

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,610
<font color="yellow">take responsibility and finish it.</font>

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,380
<font color="yellow">The regenerative medicine Mr Chae is pushing...</font>

129
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,350
<font color="yellow">had deadly effects on patients...</font>

130
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,850
<font color="yellow">who had heart valve surgery in the past.</font>

131
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,980
<font color="yellow">You're the ones...</font>

132
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,150
<font color="yellow">who told me that.</font>

133
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,350
<font color="yellow">We just solved a quiz for chicken and beer.</font>

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,880
<font color="yellow">So? Will you watch Mr Chae insist upon...</font>

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,010
<font color="yellow">regenerative surgery...</font>

136
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,210
<font color="yellow">on other patients?</font>

137
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,250
<font color="yellow">That should be enough.</font>

138
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,010
<font color="yellow">That was plenty of time to begin surgery.</font>

139
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,450
<font color="yellow">Are you sure Suk Joo took her into the OR?</font>

140
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,980
<font color="yellow">Yes. I checked the surveillance videos.</font>

141
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,480
<font color="yellow">He has something up his sleeve.</font>

142
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,880
<font color="yellow">There's no reason to pull up the surgery in secret.</font>

143

<font color="yellow">(Kang Hee Soo, Kim Jin Joo, Lee Ji Hyung)</font>

144
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,310
<font color="yellow">Tonight,</font>

145
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,750
<font color="yellow">we planned the first lung regenerative surgery.</font>

146
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,720
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow morning,</font>

147
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,910
<font color="yellow">we were going to tell the world...</font>

<font color="yellow">Bring Suk Joo and that patient to me!</font>

152

<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

153
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,780
<font color="yellow">How dare you barge into my OR?</font>

154
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

155
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,480
<font color="yellow">I'm in agony.</font>

156
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,720
<font color="yellow">What is medicine?</font>

157
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,780
<font color="yellow">Why is there no security by the ORs?</font>

158
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,580
<font color="yellow">What if you spread germs into the OR?</font>

159
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,010
<font color="yellow">Which department are you in?</font>

160
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,480
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Why you...</font>

161
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,750
<font color="yellow">What is he trying to do?</font>

162
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,380
<font color="yellow">We will now begin the lung transplant.</font>

163
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,550
<font color="yellow">I thought I made myself clear.</font>

164
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,810
<font color="yellow">Is this your response?</font>

165
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,250
<font color="yellow">I simply did my best as a doctor.</font>

166
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,750
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,080
<font color="yellow">how I got to where I am although...</font>

168
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,680
<font color="yellow">I didn't attend Hyunsung University?</font>

169
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,010
<font color="yellow">I was someone those above me needed...</font>

170
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,210
<font color="yellow">and someone those below me feared.</font>

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,380
<font color="yellow">You'll regret this.</font>

172
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,080
<font color="yellow">We did as we were told, but will we be okay?</font>

173
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,780
<font color="yellow">What could they do?</font>

174
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,050
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid of being fired?</font>

175
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,580
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't fire all five of us.</font>

176
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,810
<font color="yellow">- Move over. - We don't know anything, okay?</font>

177
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,580
<font color="yellow">The surgery schedule changed but that's all we know.</font>

178
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,650
<font color="yellow">Why did Dr Lee donate his lung to that patient?</font>

179
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,350
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. - Think about it.</font>

180
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,480
<font color="yellow">It's so dangerous.</font>

181
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,250
<font color="yellow">The likelihood of success...</font>

182
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,410
<font color="yellow">and the donor's survival rate is so low, it's illegal.</font>

183
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,580
<font color="yellow">Could you do that?</font>

184
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,850
<font color="yellow">For a stranger who isn't even family?</font>

185
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,550
<font color="yellow">Maybe she isn't a stranger, but his love!</font>

186
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,980
<font color="yellow">- Maybe she's his love! - Come on.</font>

187
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,710
<font color="yellow">How is that possible for someone like him?</font>

188
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,950
<font color="yellow">He has no heart, remember?</font>

189
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,950
<font color="yellow">- That's true. - Right.</font>

190
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,710
<font color="yellow">You never know with men and women.</font>

191
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,610
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Goodness.</font>

192
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,780
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What's with you?</font>

193
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,950
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. - Goodness.</font>

194
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,610
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Chae.</font>

195
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,780
<font color="yellow">What a beautiful day.</font>

196
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,380
<font color="yellow">I don't see the write up I was expecting...</font>

197
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,380
<font color="yellow">about the lung regenerative surgery.</font>

198
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,950
<font color="yellow">I came out for a run to calm myself down.</font>

199
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,380
<font color="yellow">He scored a suicide goal, so we should pull him.</font>

200
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,210
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter who.</font>

201
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,280
<font color="yellow">Total time, 10 minutes. Total distance, 2.5km.</font>

202
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,810
<font color="yellow">It cut me off.</font>

203
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,080
<font color="yellow">This is so annoying.</font>

204
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,780
<font color="yellow">They took the patient that we notified...</font>

205
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,250
<font color="yellow">Green Pharmacy of being our first case...</font>

206
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,710
<font color="yellow">of regenerative surgery...</font>

207
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,350
<font color="yellow">and performed an illegal surgery.</font>

208
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,350
<font color="yellow">We were robbed...</font>

209
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,980
<font color="yellow">in my own hospital.</font>

210
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,150
<font color="yellow">We were robbed,</font>

211
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,380
<font color="yellow">so we must slit their throats.</font>

212
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,050
<font color="yellow">Slit their throats?</font>

213
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,610
<font color="yellow">They performed an illegal surgery.</font>

214
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,880
<font color="yellow">We must end them using the most legal...</font>

215
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,580
<font color="yellow">and ethical way possible.</font>

216
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,810
<font color="yellow">This is insane. Live lung transplant is illegal.</font>

217
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,650
<font color="yellow">I can't believe two doctors worked together on it.</font>

218
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,610
<font color="yellow">It's a total disregard for ethics.</font>

219
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,110
<font color="yellow">Still, the patient survived.</font>

220
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,580
<font color="yellow">If we don't say anything now, the next one may die.</font>

221
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,350
<font color="yellow">We must take strict measures.</font>

222
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,950
<font color="yellow">It isn't for us to argue about among ourselves.</font>

223
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,710
<font color="yellow">The illegal surgery...</font>

224
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,380
<font color="yellow">violated our ethical rules and warrants termination.</font>

225
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,080
<font color="yellow">Lee Young Oh and Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

226
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,080
<font color="yellow">They should both be terminated.</font>

227
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,650
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee?</font>

228
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,980
<font color="yellow">We assume you have no objections.</font>

229
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

230
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,550
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Do you have plans?</font>

231
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,710
<font color="yellow">You had surgery just yesterday.</font>

232
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,950
<font color="yellow">You need your rest. You know that.</font>

233
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,010
<font color="yellow">And you were...</font>

234
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,980
<font color="yellow">You were the donor for an illegal surgery.</font>

235
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,280
<font color="yellow">Go back in.</font>

236
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,610
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang...</font>

237
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Dr Yang.</font>

238
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,110
<font color="yellow">Clinical studies show...</font>

239
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,850
<font color="yellow">that after a lung removal surgery,</font>

240
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,710
<font color="yellow">the patient...</font>

241
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,680
<font color="yellow">may exercise lightly after a day.</font>

242
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
<font color="yellow">In order...</font>

243
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,180
<font color="yellow">to show...</font>

244
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,750
<font color="yellow">how safe the surgery is,</font>

245
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,110
<font color="yellow">I must exercise.</font>

246
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,550
<font color="yellow">I don't know where you plan to go and exercise,</font>

247
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,610
<font color="yellow">but I'll tell you this. Gye Jin Sung...</font>

248
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,110
<font color="yellow">needs to rest and can't have visitors.</font>

249
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,610
<font color="yellow">There's no point grunting your way there.</font>

250
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,550
<font color="yellow">Are you no longer a patient...</font>

251
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,750
<font color="yellow">but her guardian?</font>

252
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,680
<font color="yellow">No. But...</font>

253
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,310
<font color="yellow">that woman...</font>

254
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,450
<font color="yellow">How is Gye Jin Sung...</font>

255
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
<font color="yellow">doing?</font>

256
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,920
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry.</font>

257
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,850
<font color="yellow">She's stable so far.</font>

258
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,110
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you guessed,</font>

259
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,180
<font color="yellow">but I'm sorry to tell you this.</font>

260
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,280
<font color="yellow">The board decided...</font>

261
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,310
<font color="yellow">to terminate us.</font>

262
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,710
<font color="yellow">I was expecting it,</font>

263
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,750
<font color="yellow">but I'm sorry...</font>

264
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,010
<font color="yellow">this happened to you.</font>

265
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,210
<font color="yellow">You really wanted to do regenerative medicine.</font>

266
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,250
<font color="yellow">It was the most valuable thing for you.</font>

267
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,280
<font color="yellow">You gave up on being a good doctor...</font>

268
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,750
<font color="yellow">and betrayed...</font>

269
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,750
<font color="yellow">people close to you.</font>

270
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,780
<font color="yellow">You may mock me, but I still...</font>

271
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,580
<font color="yellow">can't give up...</font>

272
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,420
<font color="yellow">on regenerative medicine.</font>

273
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
<font color="yellow">This is all trial and error.</font>

274
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,050
<font color="yellow">If we give up now,</font>

275
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,380
<font color="yellow">no one will do...</font>

276
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,150
<font color="yellow">anything dangerous to save lives.</font>

277
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,980
<font color="yellow">Saving lives...</font>

278
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,810
<font color="yellow">is always a dangerous risk, isn't it?</font>

279
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,650
<font color="yellow">Just as you did...</font>

280
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,780
<font color="yellow">for Jin Sung.</font>

281
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,310
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang.</font>

282
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,080
<font color="yellow">Can Jin Sung receive visitors?</font>

283
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

284
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,750
<font color="yellow">The responsibility of a donor toward his recipient?</font>

285
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,310
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm glad she can have visitors.</font>

286
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,210
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

287
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,950
<font color="yellow">If she can have visitors, I should go visit her.</font>

288
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,010
<font color="yellow">My brother!</font>

289
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,750
<font color="yellow">Ever since I first met you,</font>

290
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,880
<font color="yellow">I knew right away.</font>

291
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,850
<font color="yellow">You're a real man.</font>

292
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,810
<font color="yellow">You said you broke up,</font>

293
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,810
<font color="yellow">but wow. Talk about a gift.</font>

294
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,050
<font color="yellow">You didn't give her a ring or a car,</font>

295
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,610
<font color="yellow">but your body.</font>

296
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,680
<font color="yellow">Talk about a pro at dating. Here's the pro.</font>

297
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,850
<font color="yellow">Quiet.</font>

298
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,480
<font color="yellow">I need my rest.</font>

299
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

300
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,580
<font color="yellow">did you see your sister?</font>

301
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,750
<font color="yellow">If not, let's go together.</font>

302
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,350
<font color="yellow">There's no point in visiting her.</font>

303
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,710
<font color="yellow">You see her every day anyway.</font>

304
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,250
<font color="yellow">I guess Dr Lee Young Oh...</font>

305
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,410
<font color="yellow">will really be fired this time.</font>

306
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,750
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

307
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,750
<font color="yellow">A doctor conspired with another doctor...</font>

308
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,850
<font color="yellow">to perform an illegal surgery.</font>

309
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,080
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness the patient survived.</font>

310
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,250
<font color="yellow">Ethically, this is a huge problem.</font>

311
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,180
<font color="yellow">The hospital director must be in shock.</font>

312
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,910
<font color="yellow">What if word gets out? Dr Lee is no ordinary doctor.</font>

313
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,780
<font color="yellow">A psychopath surgeon...</font>

314
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,980
<font color="yellow">undergoes an illegal live transplant.</font>

315
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,050
<font color="yellow">This is like something out of a movie.</font>

316
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,980
<font color="yellow">If the board fires them,</font>

317
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,810
<font color="yellow">it'll be hard for them to find new jobs.</font>

318
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,710
<font color="yellow">What will they do?</font>

319
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,650
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Dr Lee.</font>

320
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,280
<font color="yellow">He gave up his left lung.</font>

321
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,250
<font color="yellow">He lost his health as well as his job.</font>

322
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,150
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we go visit or something?</font>

323
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,180
<font color="yellow">That's too sappy. Why would we go there?</font>

324
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,910
<font color="yellow">Since when did we consider him family?</font>

325
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,580
<font color="yellow">- He has a point. - Yes.</font>

326
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

327
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,850
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have said that.</font>

328
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,710
<font color="yellow">No one will check on him.</font>

329
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,550
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

330
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,910
<font color="yellow">Fine. He has no friends.</font>

331
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,710
<font color="yellow">I'll check in on him.</font>

332
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,880
<font color="yellow">This is humanism.</font>

333
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,980
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good.</font>

334
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee!</font>

335
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
<font color="yellow">Dr Soh.</font>

336
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,050
<font color="yellow">Please ask Ms Jang...</font>

337
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,410
<font color="yellow">to put up a sign that says...</font>

338
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,610
<font color="yellow">I need...</font>

339
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,280
<font color="yellow">to rest.</font>

340
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
<font color="yellow">I simply...</font>

341
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,710
<font color="yellow">did my best.</font>

342
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,480
<font color="yellow">I wanted...</font>

343
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,080
<font color="yellow">to create...</font>

344
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,580
<font color="yellow">a perfect world for you.</font>

345
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,250
<font color="yellow">No effort...</font>

346
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,850
<font color="yellow">by a doctor can be perfect...</font>

347
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,810
<font color="yellow">for a patient...</font>

348
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,410
<font color="yellow">who has no tomorrow.</font>

349
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,250
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

350
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,110
<font color="yellow">the reason trying your best...</font>

351
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,150
<font color="yellow">cannot exonerate you.</font>

352
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,050
<font color="yellow">Now, I understand how you feel.</font>

353
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,050
<font color="yellow">How you felt...</font>

354
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,010
<font color="yellow">that day when you took me...</font>

355
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,080
<font color="yellow">into the OR...</font>

356
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,950
<font color="yellow">when...</font>

357
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,980
<font color="yellow">everyone opposed.</font>

358
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,880
<font color="yellow">(Do not disturb.)</font>

359
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,980
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

360
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,650
<font color="yellow">The ethics council...</font>

361
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,480
<font color="yellow">will vote on your termination tomorrow.</font>

362
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,610
<font color="yellow">You'll both be given a chance to explain,</font>

363
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,980
<font color="yellow">but this was too huge.</font>

364
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,110
<font color="yellow">As a doctor,</font>

365
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,550
<font color="yellow">you can't avoid being held accountable...</font>

366
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,350
<font color="yellow">ethically.</font>

367
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,280
<font color="yellow">I expected it...</font>

368
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,410
<font color="yellow">when I decided to do it.</font>

369
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,750
<font color="yellow">You became a doctor although I was against it.</font>

370
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,850
<font color="yellow">And you came back to Hyunsung where I was.</font>

371
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,350
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised that you're accepting your termination...</font>

372
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,280
<font color="yellow">so easily.</font>

373
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,810
<font color="yellow">Because...</font>

374
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,680
<font color="yellow">I no longer need...</font>

375
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,150
<font color="yellow">your acceptance.</font>

376
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,710
<font color="yellow">Your acceptance...</font>

377
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,450
<font color="yellow">that I am not a monster,</font>

378
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,550
<font color="yellow">but a normal human being.</font>

379
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,810
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask you something.</font>

380
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,380
<font color="yellow">What did you mean...</font>

381
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,480
<font color="yellow">when you said you understand?</font>

382
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,980
<font color="yellow">You said you understand how I felt.</font>

383
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,810
<font color="yellow">What did you mean?</font>

384
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,810
<font color="yellow">The fear...</font>

385
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,980
<font color="yellow">of knowing that...</font>

386
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,280
<font color="yellow">you may lose the person closest to you.</font>

387
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,480
<font color="yellow">The sense of incompetence...</font>

388
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,150
<font color="yellow">that you can't do anything for that person...</font>

389
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,950
<font color="yellow">as a doctor.</font>

390
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,810
<font color="yellow">The sense of defeat...</font>

391
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,950
<font color="yellow">after the surgery,</font>

392
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,050
<font color="yellow">when you feel like you were completely wrong.</font>

393
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

394
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,180
<font color="yellow">whenever you saw my face,</font>

395
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,950
<font color="yellow">you thought...</font>

396
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,210
<font color="yellow">you had failed as a doctor...</font>

397
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,080
<font color="yellow">because I was a disgusting reminder...</font>

398
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,880
<font color="yellow">of that failure.</font>

399
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,910
<font color="yellow">I thought I had feared you,</font>

400
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,850
<font color="yellow">but you were the one...</font>

401
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,150
<font color="yellow">who had feared me.</font>

402
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,950
<font color="yellow">Because you were...</font>

403
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,950
<font color="yellow">the biggest abuser in our relationship,</font>

404
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,550
<font color="yellow">but also...</font>

405
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,550
<font color="yellow">the biggest victim.</font>

406
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,910
<font color="yellow">I don't have the courage to forgive you.</font>

407
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,550
<font color="yellow">But now,</font>

408
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,610
<font color="yellow">I want to try...</font>

409
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,280
<font color="yellow">and understand.</font>

410
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,010
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

411
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,380
<font color="yellow">be free now,</font>

412
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,480
<font color="yellow">as I am now.</font>

413
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,380
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

414
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,710
<font color="yellow">I heard the surgery was a success.</font>

415
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,750
<font color="yellow">I was curious about you.</font>

416
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,710
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do it no matter how hard I tried,</font>

417
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,350
<font color="yellow">but you did it so easily.</font>

418
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,480
<font color="yellow">I never imagined...</font>

419
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,150
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee would change...</font>

420
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,580
<font color="yellow">so much.</font>

421
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,850
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

422
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,250
<font color="yellow">was only by his side.</font>

423
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,250
<font color="yellow">You haven't seen him yet, have you?</font>

424
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,110
<font color="yellow">I heard he's recovering quickly, too.</font>

425
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,210
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry.</font>

426
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,980
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

427
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,710
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to him?</font>

428
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,750
<font color="yellow">You didn't know.</font>

429
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,710
<font color="yellow">The ethics council...</font>

430
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,350
<font color="yellow">is meeting now...</font>

431
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,950
<font color="yellow">to discuss his termination for what he did.</font>

432
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,710
<font color="yellow">He'll probably expelled.</font>

433
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,810
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? What did he do?</font>

434
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,710
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee...</font>

435
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,310
<font color="yellow">was prepared to lose everything...</font>

436
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,050
<font color="yellow">and gave you his lung.</font>

437
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
<font color="yellow">It's illegal to take a lung...</font>

438
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,050
<font color="yellow">from a live person.</font>

439
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,780
<font color="yellow">It holds a very high risk for the donor,</font>

440
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,750
<font color="yellow">and he went against every rule in the book.</font>

441
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,550
<font color="yellow">But that's how much...</font>

442
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,710
<font color="yellow">he wanted to save you.</font>

443
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,580
<font color="yellow">So desperately.</font>

444
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,710
<font color="yellow">Is that why...</font>

445
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,480
<font color="yellow">Will he be kicked out...</font>

446
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,280
<font color="yellow">of the hospital because of me?</font>

447
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,010
<font color="yellow">We will now begin the conference...</font>

448
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,710
<font color="yellow">to discuss the illegal surgery...</font>

449
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,150
<font color="yellow">performed by Lee Young Oh and Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

450
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,150
<font color="yellow">They should've begun.</font>

451
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,080
<font color="yellow">They'll decide on their termination by this afternoon.</font>

452
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,810
<font color="yellow">I don't understand...</font>

453
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,810
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

454
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,950
<font color="yellow">He has that...</font>

455
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,950
<font color="yellow">anti... What was it?</font>

456
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,450
<font color="yellow">Antisocial disorder.</font>

457
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,980
<font color="yellow">It is a personality disorder.</font>

458
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,550
<font color="yellow">Don't those people...</font>

459
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,810
<font color="yellow">operate solely to benefit themselves?</font>

460
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,280
<font color="yellow">Why did he do such a thing?</font>

461
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,850
<font color="yellow">What does he gain?</font>

462
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,250
<font color="yellow">Don't try to understand him. He isn't worthy.</font>

463
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,810
<font color="yellow">There's one more thing I don't understand.</font>

464
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,310
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

465
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,810
<font color="yellow">I thought he was one of your favourites,</font>

466
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,250
<font color="yellow">but you showed no mercy.</font>

467
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,980
<font color="yellow">He pushed me onto the ledge, so I had to push him off.</font>

468
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,380
<font color="yellow">I'll reach out to him when he's bloody and disgraced,</font>

469
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,910
<font color="yellow">so that he won't act out again.</font>

470
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,550
<font color="yellow">I get it then.</font>

471
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

472
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,980
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

473
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,910
<font color="yellow">You both knew...</font>

474
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,110
<font color="yellow">that a lung transplant from a living donor is illegal,</font>

475
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,480
<font color="yellow">but you carried out the surgery...</font>

476
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,550
<font color="yellow">in this hospital secretly, correct?</font>

477
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

478
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,710
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

479
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,180
<font color="yellow">It is safer to transplant lungs from two donors...</font>

480
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,480
<font color="yellow">to one person.</font>

481
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,610
<font color="yellow">Why did you carry out the surgery...</font>

482
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,850
<font color="yellow">breaking all the principles?</font>

483
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,610
<font color="yellow">The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly,</font>

484
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,050
<font color="yellow">and her heart was too weak...</font>

485
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,980
<font color="yellow">to hold on until we found another donor.</font>

486
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,980
<font color="yellow">Does it mean that you two admit everything...</font>

487
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,210
<font color="yellow">about your lung transplant surgery?</font>

488
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,610
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

489
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
<font color="yellow">You're mistaken.</font>

490
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,950
<font color="yellow">It's not...</font>

491
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,820
<font color="yellow">the truth.</font>

492
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,580
<font color="yellow">I heard they're holding...</font>

493
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,110
<font color="yellow">an ethics council meeting because of me.</font>

494
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,080
<font color="yellow">Have they made a decision yet?</font>

495
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,910
<font color="yellow">I heard it just began.</font>

496
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,680
<font color="yellow">I guess it was you, Detective Gye.</font>

497
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,910
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee Young Oh said...</font>

498
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,980
<font color="yellow">that he gave his girlfriend a lot of time...</font>

499
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,880
<font color="yellow">to think things through.</font>

500
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,750
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You need to focus on your recovery.</font>

501
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,820
<font color="yellow">Don't make Dr Lee's effort go down the drain.</font>

502
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,910
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun Suk Joo was against this surgery...</font>

503
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,180
<font color="yellow">from the beginning.</font>

504
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,550
<font color="yellow">If you check Dr Hyun's original surgery schedule,</font>

505
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,850
<font color="yellow">you'll know that it's true.</font>

506
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,750
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

507
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,320
<font color="yellow">He didn't want to do the surgery?</font>

508
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,450
<font color="yellow">I'll submit evidence.</font>

509
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,950
<font color="yellow">Please watch this footage.</font>

510
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,850
<font color="yellow">As you can see,</font>

511
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,820
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun was forced to do the surgery...</font>

512
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,180
<font color="yellow">that he shouldn't and didn't want to do.</font>

513
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,450
<font color="yellow">He did it...</font>

514
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
<font color="yellow">because of me.</font>

515
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,380
<font color="yellow">As you all know,</font>

516
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,450
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

517
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,650
<font color="yellow">empathise and have an antisocial disorder.</font>

518
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,320
<font color="yellow">People call me a psychopath.</font>

519
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,650
<font color="yellow">He had no choice but to perform the surgery...</font>

520
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,250
<font color="yellow">because I threatened him.</font>

521
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,080
<font color="yellow">- That's not true. - I'm sure...</font>

522
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,150
<font color="yellow">you would have made the same decision.</font>

523
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,010
<font color="yellow">You know that Dr Hyun...</font>

524
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,910
<font color="yellow">is an exemplary doctor.</font>

525
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,850
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

526
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,480
<font color="yellow">You'll have to take full responsibility...</font>

527
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,250
<font color="yellow">for the illegal lung transplant.</font>

528
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,820
<font color="yellow">Would that be okay with you?</font>

529
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,410
<font color="yellow">If that means I'll be dismissed,</font>

530
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,280
<font color="yellow">I'll take full responsibility.</font>

531
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,710
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

532
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,980
<font color="yellow">I don't think what I've done is wrong.</font>

533
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,550
<font color="yellow">There are a few countries where a lung transplant...</font>

534
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,080
<font color="yellow">from a living donor is legal.</font>

535
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,480
<font color="yellow">The higher being who we believe loves us...</font>

536
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,880
<font color="yellow">gave us diseases.</font>

537
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,450
<font color="yellow">The medical science to cure incurable diseases...</font>

538
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,480
<font color="yellow">still has...</font>

539
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,480
<font color="yellow">a long way to go.</font>

540
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,280
<font color="yellow">Saving someone who is dying in front of you...</font>

541
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,710
<font color="yellow">is an inevitable choice...</font>

542
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,410
<font color="yellow">a doctor has to make.</font>

543
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

544
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,980
<font color="yellow">I'm not ashamed of what I did.</font>

545
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,610
<font color="yellow">I'll accept the termination...</font>

546
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,150
<font color="yellow">willingly.</font>

547
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,350
<font color="yellow">Director Lee,</font>

548
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,280
<font color="yellow">please give me a chance to explain.</font>

549
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,280
<font color="yellow">It wasn't Dr Lee's sole decision.</font>

550
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,550
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

551
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,780
<font color="yellow">we've heard enough.</font>

552
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,750
<font color="yellow">The ethics council...</font>

553
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,250
<font color="yellow">will discuss the termination,</font>

554
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,820
<font color="yellow">and notify you two later.</font>

555
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,950
<font color="yellow">You may leave now.</font>

556
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,280
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

557
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,850
<font color="yellow">Did you think that I'd be grateful?</font>

558
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,480
<font color="yellow">Listen to me, Dr Hyun.</font>

559
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,780
<font color="yellow">I didn't do that because I thought you'd be grateful.</font>

560
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,580
<font color="yellow">Then, why did you say that?</font>

561
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
<font color="yellow">I started it,</font>

562
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,210
<font color="yellow">so I have to take responsibility for it.</font>

563
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,780
<font color="yellow">- But we made the decision... - Don't you...</font>

564
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,080
<font color="yellow">have something else...</font>

565
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,050
<font color="yellow">to take responsibility for?</font>

566
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,320
<font color="yellow">Did you plan this from the beginning?</font>

567
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,880
<font color="yellow">From the moment I decided to get the surgery?</font>

568
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,110
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that without even telling me?</font>

569
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,680
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

570
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,980
<font color="yellow">I had what you needed.</font>

571
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,010
<font color="yellow">You know how selfish I am.</font>

572
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,880
<font color="yellow">I thought about it objectively and thoroughly...</font>

573
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,910
<font color="yellow">before I made the decision.</font>

574
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,650
<font color="yellow">So you...</font>

575
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,610
<font color="yellow">don't have anything to feel sorry about anything.</font>

576
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,980
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

577
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,680
<font color="yellow">different from normal people.</font>

578
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,380
<font color="yellow">While I was seeing you,</font>

579
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,710
<font color="yellow">I thought I had changed a lot.</font>

580
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,010
<font color="yellow">But I didn't.</font>

581
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,280
<font color="yellow">I was mistaken.</font>

582
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,280
<font color="yellow">A miracle like that won't happen...</font>

583
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,250
<font color="yellow">in the future, either.</font>

584
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

585
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,210
<font color="yellow">baffle you...</font>

586
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,710
<font color="yellow">from time to time.</font>

587
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
<font color="yellow">I may...</font>

588
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,780
<font color="yellow">make you feel lonely,</font>

589
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,110
<font color="yellow">and you'll be disheartened...</font>

590
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,980
<font color="yellow">because I won't be able to change.</font>

591
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,410
<font color="yellow">Even in those moments,</font>

592
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,850
<font color="yellow">I won't know how to...</font>

593
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,380
<font color="yellow">comfort you.</font>

594
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,150
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

595
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,780
<font color="yellow">Please don't forget.</font>

596
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,320
<font color="yellow">Every breath you take,</font>

597
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,680
<font color="yellow">please remember how I feel about you,</font>

598
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,380
<font color="yellow">and what you...</font>

599
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,080
<font color="yellow">mean to me.</font>

600
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,250
<font color="yellow">What do I mean to you?</font>

601
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,410
<font color="yellow">You're recovering more quickly than I expected.</font>

602
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,480
<font color="yellow">Your breathing is quite stable.</font>

603
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,250
<font color="yellow">It's not bad.</font>

604
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,710
<font color="yellow">Let's conclude that Dr Hyun Suk Joo...</font>

605
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,880
<font color="yellow">will stay considering the circumstances,</font>

606
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,980
<font color="yellow">and that Dr Lee Young Oh...</font>

607
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,580
<font color="yellow">will be terminated.</font>

608
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,480
<font color="yellow">Please withdraw...</font>

609
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,480
<font color="yellow">the termination of Dr Lee.</font>

610
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,350
<font color="yellow">What are you saying, Director Lee?</font>

611
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,450
<font color="yellow">Can't you separate work and personal life?</font>

612
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,580
<font color="yellow">He's a doctor who did his best to save a patient...</font>

613
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,480
<font color="yellow">risking his own life.</font>

614
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,650
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee didn't hesitate to perform the surgery...</font>

615
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,610
<font color="yellow">because he lacks empathy.</font>

616
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,180
<font color="yellow">If word got out about this surgery,</font>

617
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,380
<font color="yellow">it'll damage our reputation and reliability.</font>

618
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,150
<font color="yellow">If Dr Lee's empathy disorder is the problem,</font>

619
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,480
<font color="yellow">the person who should be punished...</font>

620
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,250
<font color="yellow">is me.</font>

621
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,650
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee developed this personality disorder...</font>

622
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,310
<font color="yellow">because I abused him...</font>

623
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,310
<font color="yellow">to cover up my mistake.</font>

624
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,610
<font color="yellow">Despite that,</font>

625
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,450
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee was...</font>

626
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,910
<font color="yellow">a better doctor than the one I've been trying to be...</font>

627
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,580
<font color="yellow">my entire life.</font>

628
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,050
<font color="yellow">I don't know what laws or regulations...</font>

629
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,610
<font color="yellow">I have to hold him by.</font>

630
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,810
<font color="yellow">However, I know...</font>

631
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,580
<font color="yellow">that in an organisation...</font>

632
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,650
<font color="yellow">responsibility must be taken.</font>

633
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,780

<font color="yellow">Director Lee...</font>

642

646
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,410
<font color="yellow">sacrificed himself to save Dr Lee.</font>

647

663
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,650
<font color="yellow">We just went through trial and error...</font>

664
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,950
<font color="yellow">like all research teams do.</font>

665
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,050

674
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,580
<font color="yellow">they developed the side effects.</font>

675
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
<font color="yellow">It was a mistake in the clinical trial...</font>

676
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,250
<font color="yellow">that you could've fixed easily.</font>

677
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,180

696
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,810

00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,610
<font color="yellow">- Min Jae! - Let go of me!</font>

792
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,580
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim, you look great on television.</font>

793
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,110
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

794
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,950
<font color="yellow">Why don't we work on a research paper together...</font>

795
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,280
<font color="yellow">for the upcoming neurology conference?</font>

796
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,080
<font color="yellow">We can be academic celebrities.</font>

797
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

798
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,650
<font color="yellow">I'm not keen on listing people who don't contribute.</font>

799
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,280
<font color="yellow">Min Jae. Min. Hey, Min Jae.</font>

800
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,080
<font color="yellow">Kim Min Jae!</font>

801
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

802
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,350
<font color="yellow">I just visited Director Shin's grave.</font>

803
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,280
<font color="yellow">I heard the research team developed...</font>

804
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,810
<font color="yellow">a myocardial sheet...</font>

805
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,750
<font color="yellow">without side effects for valve patients.</font>

806
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,710
<font color="yellow">Yes. How did you know?</font>

807
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:37,910
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee told me.</font>

808
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,110
<font color="yellow">My son visited me recently.</font>

809
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,880
<font color="yellow">The director told me...</font>

810
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,750
<font color="yellow">that you aren't taking any painkillers.</font>

811
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,350
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too painful?</font>

812
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,480
<font color="yellow">I'm doing great.</font>

813
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,950
<font color="yellow">I want to...</font>

814
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,150
<font color="yellow">live out my life...</font>

815
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,950
<font color="yellow">being the person I am until the end.</font>

816
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,750
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun,</font>

817
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,080
<font color="yellow">I'm really proud of you...</font>

818
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,180
<font color="yellow">for being so brave at such a young age.</font>

819
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,210
<font color="yellow">In exchange, I'm tightening my belt...</font>

820
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,380
<font color="yellow">to cover the research funds.</font>

821
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,050
<font color="yellow">Yet, I'm happy.</font>

822
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,180
<font color="yellow">Nam Gun Ho.</font>

823
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,310
<font color="yellow">The test results are out.</font>

824
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,750
<font color="yellow">I fainted during the rehearsal.</font>

825
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,980
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm getting older.</font>

826
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,180
<font color="yellow">Nam Gun Ho.</font>

827
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,180
<font color="yellow">This is a jazz piece by Shostakovich.</font>

828
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,880
<font color="yellow">Do you know it?</font>

829
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,180
<font color="yellow">There's an acoustic nerve glioma.</font>

830
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,150
<font color="yellow">You have a tumour in the acoustic nerve.</font>

831
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:03,950
<font color="yellow">Will I be okay...</font>

832
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,610
<font color="yellow">with the surgery?</font>

833
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,410
<font color="yellow">As you suspect, you will lose auditory function.</font>

834
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:12,010
<font color="yellow">What happens if I don't undergo surgery?</font>

835
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,180
<font color="yellow">It's like a ticking bomb...</font>

836
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,410
<font color="yellow">that can cause a fatal...</font>

837
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,250
<font color="yellow">cerebral haemorrhage.</font>

838
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,080
<font color="yellow">If the surgery is successful,</font>

839
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,550
<font color="yellow">will my auditory function...</font>

840
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,080

<font color="yellow">Sometimes, hope...</font>

<font color="yellow">makes you expect the impossible.</font>

843
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,580
<font color="yellow">Nam Gun Ho, I want you...</font>

844
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,180
<font color="yellow">to make the right decision.</font>

845
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,950

847
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,280
<font color="yellow">What do you know about music?</font>

848
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,880
<font color="yellow">You have...</font>

849

<font color="yellow">never had a chance to appreciate music.</font>

850
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,710
<font color="yellow">That's how you can make such a stoic expression...</font>

<font color="yellow">towards a cellist.</font>

852
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,250
<font color="yellow">That's how you can tell me...</font>

853
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,450
<font color="yellow">that I'll lose my hearing.</font>

854
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,480
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

855
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:30,080
<font color="yellow">Tell me if I'm wrong.</font>

856
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:33,910
<font color="yellow">You may continue.</font>

<font color="yellow">I...</font>

<font color="yellow">your pain.</font>

860

<font color="yellow">I can't be in pain for you.</font>

861
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,480
<font color="yellow">I have a disability that impairs...</font>

<font color="yellow">my ability to empathise with others.</font>

863

<font color="yellow">I cannot even appreciate music.</font>

865
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,650
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

866
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,680
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to stand by your side.</font>

867
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,750
<font color="yellow">I won't ever turn a blind eye to your pain...</font>

<font color="yellow">the stairs.</font>

876
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,450
<font color="yellow">They must be very steep.</font>

877
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,680
<font color="yellow">Do you really expect me...</font>

878
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,780
<font color="yellow">to believe you can feel that?</font>

879

<font color="yellow">That's how I ended up lying everyday.</font>

<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

885
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,950
<font color="yellow">can you feel where I am headed?</font>

01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,910
<font color="yellow">I cannot even empathise with you.</font>

01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,010
<font color="yellow">That's called logical reasoning.</font>

<font color="yellow">It's called logic.</font>
