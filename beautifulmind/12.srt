<font color="yellow">into such a dangerous surgery because of your son.</font>

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,850
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear?</font>

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,670
<font color="yellow">His parents abandoned him.</font>

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,320
<font color="yellow">My doctor appeared like an angel...</font>

00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,620
<font color="yellow">and operated on me.</font>

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,920

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,890

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,050
<font color="yellow">Then, he became my dad.</font>

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,250
<font color="yellow">He must have liked me.</font>

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,750

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,720
<font color="yellow">Is it true...</font>

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,050
<font color="yellow">that we are accepting foreign investments?</font>

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,950
<font color="yellow">Does that mean we no longer own...</font>

<font color="yellow">the research on regenerative medicine...</font>

00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,380
<font color="yellow">In exchange, Hyunsung Group will be mine.</font>

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,720
<font color="yellow">We poured so much effort on the regenerative medicine.</font>

<font color="yellow">We can't just hand it over...</font>

<font color="yellow">Come on, stand up.</font>

34
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,520
<font color="yellow">I just arranged this occasion...</font>

35
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,090
<font color="yellow">in order to introduce you to an old friend of yours.</font>

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,950
<font color="yellow">You would be very glad to see him.</font>

<font color="yellow">my friend.</font>

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why would you be against such a good friend?</font>

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,320
<font color="yellow">President Oh Young Bae of Green Pharmacy...</font>

42
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,920
<font color="yellow">made a large investment for our regenerative medicine.</font>

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,550
<font color="yellow">Your son has grown up well.</font>

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,520
<font color="yellow">With his frontal lobe damaged,</font>

45
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,650
<font color="yellow">he's unable to empathise.</font>

46
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,650
<font color="yellow">You didn't say anything,</font>

47
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,320
<font color="yellow">but you must have been waiting.</font>

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,150
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about the MRI scan.</font>

49
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,790
<font color="yellow">You thought there would be a change...</font>

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,050
<font color="yellow">and that you'd be able to feel emotions.</font>

51
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,090
<font color="yellow">Am I right?</font>

52
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,220
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,890
<font color="yellow">I'm glad how things turned out.</font>

54
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,120
<font color="yellow">I found out how uncertain and temporarily feelings...</font>

55
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,150
<font color="yellow">could change people...</font>

56
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,740
<font color="yellow">or make them unsure.</font>

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,650
<font color="yellow">I know for certain now.</font>

58
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,720
<font color="yellow">That's enough for me.</font>

59
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,650
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,420
<font color="yellow">I'm at peace with the way I am.</font>

61
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,150
<font color="yellow">This is what you always say.</font>

62
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,560
<font color="yellow">"Your lips may lie,"</font>

63
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,650
<font color="yellow">"but your body..."</font>

64
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,650
<font color="yellow">"can't hide it."</font>

65
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

66
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,690
<font color="yellow">Which patient do you need my second opinion on?</font>

67
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,390
<font color="yellow">My face hurts everywhere.</font>

68
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,490
<font color="yellow">It feels like I was either cut by a knife or got burnt.</font>

69
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,890
<font color="yellow">She had brain tumour surgery a year ago.</font>

70
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,230
<font color="yellow">The tumour has been moved,</font>

71
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,790
<font color="yellow">but she's suffering from chronic facial pain.</font>

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,750
<font color="yellow">I've heard about you.</font>

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
<font color="yellow">You've cured Kim Myung Soo...</font>

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,320
<font color="yellow">and Kang Il Do of Hyunsung Group.</font>

75
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,850
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,650
<font color="yellow">I can't live like this any more.</font>

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,050
<font color="yellow">Please make my pain go away.</font>

78
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,250
<font color="yellow">There are nerves...</font>

79
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,950
<font color="yellow">in my face, right?</font>

80
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,250
<font color="yellow">Please remove them.</font>

81
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,410
<font color="yellow">I'm all right with that.</font>

82
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,690
<font color="yellow">I will do anything to get rid of this pain.</font>

83
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,750
<font color="yellow">Please, Doctor.</font>

84
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,420
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am.
-  Yes?</font>

85
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,550
<font color="yellow">The nerves on your face...</font>

86
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,620
<font color="yellow">have already been removed.</font>

87
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,850
<font color="yellow">They were removed during your surgery a year ago.</font>

88
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,700
<font color="yellow">It still hurts.</font>

89
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,240
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

90
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,720
<font color="yellow">My face still hurts.</font>

91
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,150
<font color="yellow">The medical term is neuropathic pain.</font>

92
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,750
<font color="yellow">To compensate for the loss of nerves,</font>

93
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,090
<font color="yellow">your brain is making you feel pain that isn't real.</font>

94
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,220
<font color="yellow">Just like other people,</font>

95
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,790
<font color="yellow">are you saying...</font>

96
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,550
<font color="yellow">that I've lost my mind?</font>

97
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,220
<font color="yellow">I'm suffering so much that...</font>

98
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,790
<font color="yellow">every day is difficult to bear.</font>

99
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,550
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,190
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

101
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
<font color="yellow">Perhaps,</font>

102
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,350
<font color="yellow">suffering is necessary.</font>

103
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,450
<font color="yellow">Life without suffering is not real.</font>

104
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,490
<font color="yellow">That's what she's saying.</font>

105
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,150
<font color="yellow">Young Oh.</font>

106
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,050
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

107
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,990
<font color="yellow">the only person who was kind to me...</font>

108
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,450
<font color="yellow">without any reason.</font>

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,050
<font color="yellow">When...</font>

110
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
<font color="yellow">I found out that you were being fake,</font>

111
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,950
<font color="yellow">my life seemed fake, too.</font>

112
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,920
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bear it.</font>

113
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,050
<font color="yellow">I was angry.</font>

114
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,090
<font color="yellow">I thought it was just rage,</font>

115
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,520
<font color="yellow">but I know now.</font>

116
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,550
<font color="yellow">I was just in pain.</font>

117
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,320
<font color="yellow">It was pain?</font>

118
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,350
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

119
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,420
<font color="yellow">If it becomes...</font>

120
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,350
<font color="yellow">possible one day,</font>

121
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,420
<font color="yellow">accept...</font>

122
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,590
<font color="yellow">suffering as is.</font>

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,850
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, that's what...</font>

124
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,290
<font color="yellow">normal people do.</font>

125
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,350
<font color="yellow">I didn't know, either.</font>

126
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,920
<font color="yellow">Do you think we can start over?</font>

127
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,850
<font color="yellow">From the beginning?</font>

128
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,190
<font color="yellow">Isn't it funny how life turns out?</font>

129
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,220
<font color="yellow">You and I get to meet again.</font>

130
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,850
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

131
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you appear in front of me again?</font>

132
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,390
<font color="yellow">Joint investment...</font>

133
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,120
<font color="yellow">in regenerative medicine.</font>

134
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,120
<font color="yellow">Patent for the stem cell treatment.</font>

135
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,090
<font color="yellow">Join my Green Pharmacy.</font>

136
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,180
<font color="yellow">What are friends for?</font>

137
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,190
<font color="yellow">Regenerative medicine?</font>

138
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,390
<font color="yellow">I put my life into that research.</font>

139
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,420
<font color="yellow">I wanted to give patients with incurable diseases hope.</font>

140
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,720
<font color="yellow">I dreamed that...</font>

141
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,820
<font color="yellow">no surgeons would be needed any more someday.</font>

142
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,790
<font color="yellow">Why don't you want to work with me?</font>

143
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,220
<font color="yellow">There's no other company that contributed to...</font>

144
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,000
<font color="yellow">the public health as much as us.</font>

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,120
<font color="yellow">Your international pharmaceutical company...</font>

146
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,660
<font color="yellow">has done enough.</font>

147
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,620
<font color="yellow">I know enough.</font>

148
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,850
<font color="yellow">To get patents for new medicine,</font>

149
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,800
<font color="yellow">you lobbied...</font>

150
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,120
<font color="yellow">and spent tremendous amounts of money,</font>

151
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,890
<font color="yellow">but you had no interest in treating or curing patients.</font>

152
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,920
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

153
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,390
<font color="yellow">with patients' lives as collateral,</font>

154
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,720
<font color="yellow">you only cared about raising the price of the medicine.</font>

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,850
<font color="yellow">If I hand over the stem cell treatment to you,</font>

156
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,850
<font color="yellow">patients won't die of diseases.</font>

157
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,850
<font color="yellow">You'll kill them by not providing them the treatment.</font>

158
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,450
<font color="yellow">I won't let you do that...</font>

159
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,220
<font color="yellow">to what I've sacrificed my life for.</font>

160
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,590
<font color="yellow">You told me that...</font>

161
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,120
<font color="yellow">you'll devote your life to help that child...</font>

162
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,850
<font color="yellow">live like a normal person.</font>

163
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,890
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to wonder...</font>

164
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,250
<font color="yellow">what your focus is on.</font>

165
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,150
<font color="yellow">You don't have the right...</font>

166
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,320
<font color="yellow">to ridicule my life.</font>

167
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,690
<font color="yellow">Are you sure...</font>

168
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,120
<font color="yellow">I don't?</font>

169
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,850
<font color="yellow">Look at me. I'm in a wheelchair.</font>

170
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,150
<font color="yellow">Is Dr Lee in Neurosurgery?</font>

171
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,190
<font color="yellow">I heard he's now a better surgeon than you are.</font>

172
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,420
<font color="yellow">I wonder...</font>

173
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,550
<font color="yellow">if he can fix my legs.</font>

174
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,290
<font color="yellow">I think I'll ask him in person.</font>

175
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,020
<font color="yellow">He knows, right?</font>

176
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,420
<font color="yellow">Does he know his frontal lobe is dysfunctional...</font>

177
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,090
<font color="yellow">and that he's a psychopath...</font>

178
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,220
<font color="yellow">because of your mistake?</font>

179
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,050
<font color="yellow">Does he know it was medical malpractice?</font>

180
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,090
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

181
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,290
<font color="yellow">Does he not know?</font>

182
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,120
<font color="yellow">Please wait.</font>

183
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,980
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

184
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,150
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Wi-Fi)</font>

186
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
<font color="yellow">Pardon me.</font>

187
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,550
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you picking up your phone?</font>

188
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,050
<font color="yellow">I thought about it.</font>

189
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,020
<font color="yellow">You're smarter and more eloquent than I am.</font>

190
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,620
<font color="yellow">I can't win by arguing, right?</font>

191
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,790
<font color="yellow">Can we not complicate things?</font>

192
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,020
<font color="yellow">What I wanted from you...</font>

193
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,050
<font color="yellow">and what I wanted to do for you was...</font>

194
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,220
<font color="yellow">to spend time.</font>

195
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,690
<font color="yellow">I want to spend time with you.</font>

196
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,420
<font color="yellow">Is that not enough?</font>

197
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,720
<font color="yellow">It's Ewing sarcoma in the cervical vertebrae.</font>

198
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,720
<font color="yellow">Surgery won't be easy.</font>

199
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,850
<font color="yellow">Should I tell him that he's going to be paralysed...</font>

200
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,050
<font color="yellow">and needs a respirator for the rest of his life?</font>

201
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,890
<font color="yellow">It'll be terrible for the wife to hear.</font>

202
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,270
<font color="yellow">They're newly-weds, and she's eight-months pregnant.</font>

203
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,190
<font color="yellow">He wants to hug his baby at least once.</font>

204
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,960
<font color="yellow">That's the reality of every emergency case.</font>

205
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,090
<font color="yellow">They ask to be hospitalised and ask for surgery.</font>

206
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,820
<font color="yellow">What's the point when the patient has no hope?</font>

207
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
<font color="yellow">It's nonsense.</font>

208
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,690
<font color="yellow">Don't be so harsh on the newly-weds.</font>

209
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,090
<font color="yellow">Is it that difficult to tell your patient...</font>

210
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,990
<font color="yellow">your diagnosis?</font>

211
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,020
<font color="yellow">The patient is yours.</font>

212
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,490
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

213
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,590
<font color="yellow">You'll do great.</font>

214
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,690
<font color="yellow">We're leaving.</font>

215
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,520
<font color="yellow">It's Ewing sarcoma in C3.</font>

216
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,390
<font color="yellow">You have a tumour.</font>

217
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,390
<font color="yellow">Surgery in this area is risky.</font>

218
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,420
<font color="yellow">Paralysis...</font>

219
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,120
<font color="yellow">Until the cancer spreads,</font>

220
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,890
<font color="yellow">he'll need a respirator for the rest of his life.</font>

221
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,040
<font color="yellow">If the tumour spreads to the nerves of the spine,</font>

222
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,060
<font color="yellow">radiation treatment is the only way.</font>

223
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,710
<font color="yellow">If oedema occurs, there's nothing you can do.</font>

224
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,820
<font color="yellow">Did I miss anything?</font>

225
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,220
<font color="yellow">You seem to know what you're talking about.</font>

226
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,420
<font color="yellow">We were turned down by 12 to 13 hospitals...</font>

227
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,390
<font color="yellow">for the same reason.</font>

228
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,720
<font color="yellow">Shall I continue?</font>

229
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,920
<font color="yellow">Isn't she smart?</font>

230
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,590
<font color="yellow">She's my wife.</font>

231
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,820
<font color="yellow">Doctor, you must be mistaken.</font>

232
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,850
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you...</font>

233
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,650
<font color="yellow">to cure my husband's disease.</font>

234
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,790
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to extend his life for 10 years.</font>

235
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,390
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you...</font>

236
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,150
<font color="yellow">to buy him time until our baby is born.</font>

237
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,020
<font color="yellow">Time we can spend together.</font>

238
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,150
<font color="yellow">I'm not...</font>

239
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,020
<font color="yellow">asking you to do something impossible.</font>

240
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,720
<font color="yellow">Please help him...</font>

241
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,620
<font color="yellow">live just one more month.</font>

242
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,450
<font color="yellow">He deserves to see his baby.</font>

243
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,370
<font color="yellow">He has to see who it resembles.</font>

244
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,790
<font color="yellow">I'm saying the surgery is difficult.</font>

245
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,390
<font color="yellow">Pardon me.</font>

246
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,450
<font color="yellow">I will take...</font>

247
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,150
<font color="yellow">this surgery.</font>

248
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,720
<font color="yellow">Is it confidence...</font>

249
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,290
<font color="yellow">or arrogance?</font>

250
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,320
<font color="yellow">The surgery is risky.</font>

251
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,890
<font color="yellow">Why won't he just stick to chemotherapy?</font>

252
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,190
<font color="yellow">It's risky,</font>

253
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,080
<font color="yellow">but the patient and his wife want it.</font>

254
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,490
<font color="yellow">I think it's a risk worth taking.</font>

255
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,450
<font color="yellow">The patient wants to see his baby.</font>

256
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,790
<font color="yellow">How can you ignore such a wish?</font>

257
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,420
<font color="yellow">What's going on between you two?</font>

258
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,820
<font color="yellow">After working with him a few times,</font>

259
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,550
<font color="yellow">are you being duped by the look in his eyes?</font>

260
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,720
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

261
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,750
<font color="yellow">Red sun.</font>

262
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,950
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee can't empathise with his patients.</font>

263
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,390
<font color="yellow">He just wants to do that surgery...</font>

264
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,880
<font color="yellow">only to satisfy his curiosity in medicine.</font>

265
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,950
<font color="yellow">Dr Soh...</font>

266
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,620
<font color="yellow">has something personal against Dr Lee,</font>

267
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,480
<font color="yellow">but his analysis is accurate.</font>

268
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,920
<font color="yellow">The surgery is possible because it's Dr Lee.</font>

269
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,180
<font color="yellow">It's true. Success rate is minimal,</font>

270
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,790
<font color="yellow">and it's a risky surgery.</font>

271
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,360
<font color="yellow">Most surgeons would be too scared.</font>

272
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,860
<font color="yellow">It'd be a disaster from the start, right?</font>

273
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,620
<font color="yellow">I didn't expect this.</font>

274
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,920
<font color="yellow">You've chosen patients based on probability so far.</font>

275
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,690
<font color="yellow">Why would you...</font>

276
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,990
<font color="yellow">choose a patient...</font>

277
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,950
<font color="yellow">who has little...</font>

278
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,550
<font color="yellow">to no chances of survival?</font>

279
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,890
<font color="yellow">Is it the patient or you who's desperate?</font>

280
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,860
<font color="yellow">Are you desperate...</font>

281
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,550
<font color="yellow">to prove your superiority by taking on a risky surgery?</font>

282
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,490
<font color="yellow">I'm very curious...</font>

283
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,990
<font color="yellow">about the reason why I...</font>

284
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,090
<font color="yellow">chose to do this.</font>

285
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,720
<font color="yellow">If you become my business partner,</font>

286
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,820
<font color="yellow">I'll only think about our future.</font>

287
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,620
<font color="yellow">What would happen...</font>

288
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,490
<font color="yellow">to Lee Young Oh once he finds out the secret...</font>

289
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,750
<font color="yellow">you've been keeping from him?</font>

290
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,390
<font color="yellow">Will you be okay?</font>

291
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,190
<font color="yellow">It's a consent form.</font>

292
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,890
<font color="yellow">The surgery will be very difficult.</font>

293
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,250
<font color="yellow">Ewing sarcoma is a tumour in the bone.</font>

294
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,120
<font color="yellow">It may spread easily.</font>

295
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,860
<font color="yellow">If the surgery result isn't good,</font>

296
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,690
<font color="yellow">you'll live the rest of your life...</font>

297
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,790
<font color="yellow">as a quadriplegic while depending on a respirator.</font>

298
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,550
<font color="yellow">I'm already in a wheelchair.</font>

299
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,820
<font color="yellow">What I want to know about...</font>

300
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,650
<font color="yellow">is you.</font>

301
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,790
<font color="yellow">No one recommended the surgery as it's risky.</font>

302
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,390
<font color="yellow">It probably means it's risky for the patient,</font>

303
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,220
<font color="yellow">but doesn't it also mean it's risky for the doctor?</font>

304
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,250
<font color="yellow">Responsibility, honour.</font>

305
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,690
<font color="yellow">It may negatively impact those things.</font>

306
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,520
<font color="yellow">Why did you agree on this surgery?</font>

307
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,550
<font color="yellow">I mean, why did you choose me?</font>

308
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,820
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask that?</font>

309
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,620
<font color="yellow">Don't be so moved by him.</font>

310
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,890
<font color="yellow">He's a surgery machine.</font>

311
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,190
<font color="yellow">He wants to become more famous.</font>

312
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,090
<font color="yellow">He wants to show the world that he can do it.</font>

313
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,120
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

314
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,320
<font color="yellow">You learn things just by walking around the hospital.</font>

315
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

316
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,650
<font color="yellow">You're so precious.</font>

317
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,420
<font color="yellow">Please understand even if it's uncomfortable.</font>

318
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,520
<font color="yellow">Which shall I understand?</font>

319
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,550
<font color="yellow">A surgery machine who wants to be famous?</font>

320
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,790
<font color="yellow">Or this act?</font>

321
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,620
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter what you think, Doctor,</font>

322
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,450
<font color="yellow">as long as...</font>

323
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,420
<font color="yellow">you keep him next to me.</font>

324
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,350
<font color="yellow">Please help...</font>

325
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,250
<font color="yellow">my husband...</font>

326
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,450
<font color="yellow">live a little longer.</font>

327
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,150
<font color="yellow">Sign the consent form for the surgery.</font>

328
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,190
<font color="yellow">Agree that you'll follow my decisions and methods.</font>

329
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,350
<font color="yellow">You signed the consent form, which means...</font>

330
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,720
<font color="yellow">that you'll follow...</font>

331
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,450
<font color="yellow">my methods of treatment and decisions.</font>

332
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

333
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,120
<font color="yellow">Acting overly affectionate...</font>

334
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,820
<font color="yellow">towards your husband doesn't help him.</font>

335
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,290
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's time for your regular check-up yet.</font>

336
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,220
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling sick?</font>

337
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,690
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

338
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,720
<font color="yellow">transferred to the Violent Crimes Division.</font>

339
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,720
<font color="yellow">I wanted to get a check-up before I get one...</font>

340
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,750
<font color="yellow">for the transfer job.</font>

341
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,760
<font color="yellow">It was hard to get into that division.</font>

342
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,050
<font color="yellow">I don't want my heart condition to stop me.</font>

343
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,750
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

344
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,350
<font color="yellow">You wanted to join the Violent Crimes Division.</font>

345
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,950
<font color="yellow">You're working hard...</font>

346
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,350
<font color="yellow">to commercialise the regenerative medicine.</font>

347
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,590
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

348
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,650
<font color="yellow">I'll call you when the test results are out.</font>

349
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,620
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun.</font>

350
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,320
<font color="yellow">I have a question.</font>

351
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,720
<font color="yellow">Thinking is done in the head,</font>

352
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,650
<font color="yellow">but when I think about someone,</font>

353
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,790
<font color="yellow">why does my heart hurt instead of my head?</font>

354
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,250
<font color="yellow">- Wait a minute.
-  What's going on?</font>

355
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,950
<font color="yellow">I can't do it.</font>

356
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,890
<font color="yellow">I can't let him get this surgery.</font>

357
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,590
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, what did you say?</font>

358
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
<font color="yellow">This surgery...</font>

359
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,320
<font color="yellow">is way too risky.</font>

360
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,450
<font color="yellow">There's a reason why no doctor would do it.</font>

361
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,350
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

362
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,250
<font color="yellow">he doesn't wake up after the surgery?</font>

363
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,550
<font color="yellow">You signed the consent form.</font>

364
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,650
<font color="yellow">That's because the doctor told me to.</font>

365
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,990
<font color="yellow">That consent form isn't important.</font>

366
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,940
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Ma'am, what are you doing?</font>

367
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,750
<font color="yellow">Dr Yang, she's right.</font>

368
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,990
<font color="yellow">Let me ask again.</font>

369
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,690
<font color="yellow">Are you giving up...</font>

370
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,400
<font color="yellow">on this surgery?</font>

371
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,650
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  No.</font>

372
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,650
<font color="yellow">Let's think this over, okay?</font>

373
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,950
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

374
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,920
<font color="yellow">I want this surgery.</font>

375
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,100
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

376
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,290
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?</font>

377
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,730
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

378
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,230
<font color="yellow">I don't want it.</font>

379
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,250
<font color="yellow">Eun Joo.</font>

380
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,220
<font color="yellow">Be quiet and wait.</font>

381
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,490
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make it.</font>

382
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,050
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Doctor.</font>

383
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,250
<font color="yellow">How can you treat me like that?</font>

384
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,190
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell our baby what you did.</font>

385
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,450
<font color="yellow">Please forgive her, Doctor.</font>

386
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,490
<font color="yellow">To an immature girl...</font>

387
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,590
<font color="yellow">like her,</font>

388
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,890
<font color="yellow">I am the world to her...</font>

389
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,690
<font color="yellow">despite my incurable disease.</font>

390
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,220
<font color="yellow">She means the world to me, too.</font>

391
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,050
<font color="yellow">We have no other family members.</font>

392
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,950
<font color="yellow">That's why we come off as offensive.</font>

393
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,150
<font color="yellow">We're just trying...</font>

394
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,550
<font color="yellow">to protect each other.</font>

395
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,890
<font color="yellow">That's also why...</font>

396
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,120
<font color="yellow">I couldn't give up this surgery.</font>

397
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,650
<font color="yellow">I want to see my son.</font>

398
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,950
<font color="yellow">I need to see...</font>

399
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,190
<font color="yellow">if I can trust him enough...</font>

400
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,420
<font color="yellow">to protect her...</font>

401
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,920
<font color="yellow">when I die.</font>

402
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,290
<font color="yellow">That way, I'll be able to die in peace.</font>

403
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

404
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,150
<font color="yellow">Please promise me.</font>

405
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,550
<font color="yellow">Let's begin.</font>

406
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,200
<font color="yellow">I heard Young Oh...</font>

407
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,990
<font color="yellow">is doing a risky surgery.</font>

408
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,120
<font color="yellow">He enjoys risky surgeries...</font>

409
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,020
<font color="yellow">just like you.</font>

410
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,190
<font color="yellow">He's definitely...</font>

411
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,090
<font color="yellow">someone you made.</font>

412
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,890
<font color="yellow">Haven't you decided yet...</font>

413
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,920
<font color="yellow">as to which side to take?</font>

414
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

415
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,150
<font color="yellow">The surgery went well.</font>

416
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,620
<font color="yellow">Tumours found during the test...</font>

417
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,620
<font color="yellow">were all removed.</font>

418
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,650
<font color="yellow">Don't make it complicated.</font>

419
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
<font color="yellow">Does that mean...</font>

420
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,590
<font color="yellow">my husband is alive?</font>

421
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,720
<font color="yellow">You're saying he's okay, right?</font>

422
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,220
<font color="yellow">He is so far.</font>

423
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,050
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

424
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,850
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

425
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,450
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee is incredible.</font>

426
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,950
<font color="yellow">He removed all the Ewing sarcoma tumours.</font>

427
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,050
<font color="yellow">I saw the scans.</font>

428
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,050
<font color="yellow">It was clean.</font>

429
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,050
<font color="yellow">Only Dr Lee could do the surgery.</font>

430
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,990
<font color="yellow">It was good for both the patient and Dr Lee...</font>

431
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,820
<font color="yellow">to have taken the risk.</font>

432
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,400
<font color="yellow">Recovery is more important.</font>

433
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,550
<font color="yellow">What's the point if the patient doesn't survive?</font>

434
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,690
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
-  Hey.</font>

435
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,090
<font color="yellow">How's the patient?</font>

436
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,120
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'll recover soon?</font>

437
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
<font color="yellow">It's needless to say.</font>

438
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,150
<font color="yellow">Of course, it won't be easy.</font>

439
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,390
<font color="yellow">Are the results that bad?</font>

440
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,520
<font color="yellow">I'm saying there's not much to say.</font>

441
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,320
<font color="yellow">Patients Dr Lee chooses always survive.</font>

442
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  What?</font>

443
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,050
<font color="yellow">The surgery went well.</font>

444
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,550
<font color="yellow">The results are good, too.</font>

445
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,290
<font color="yellow">The patient is going outside today.</font>

446
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,050
<font color="yellow">- Going outside?
-  Going outside?</font>

447
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,770
<font color="yellow">We had to hurry to the hospital,</font>

448
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,650
<font color="yellow">so we didn't have time to prepare for the baby.</font>

449
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,020
<font color="yellow">We'll be right back after buying some baby clothes.</font>

450
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,690
<font color="yellow">Just don't be late for our appointment.</font>

451
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,250
<font color="yellow">You said we'd be eating out.</font>

452
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,420
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's do that, too.</font>

453
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,320
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

454
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,820
<font color="yellow">I'd kiss you if I could,</font>

455
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,350
<font color="yellow">but my husband might get jealous, so I won't.</font>

456
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,390
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

457
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,550
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

458
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,920
<font color="yellow">The surgery must have gone well.</font>

459
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,790
<font color="yellow">The patient even went out.</font>

460
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,690
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

461
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,020
<font color="yellow">Tumour I didn't detect in the scans...</font>

462
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,820
<font color="yellow">spread to the nerves of the spine.</font>

463
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,650
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to switch to radiation treatment.</font>

464
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,290
<font color="yellow">Why did you allow him to leave?</font>

465
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,290
<font color="yellow">Doctors...</font>

466
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,120
<font color="yellow">don't save people's lives.</font>

467
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,090
<font color="yellow">They only extend their lives.</font>

468
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,120
<font color="yellow">Arguing, laughing, talking and eating...</font>

469
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,990
<font color="yellow">with loved ones.</font>

470
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,850
<font color="yellow">Those daily, meaningless things.</font>

471
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,750
<font color="yellow">People on average tend to find happiness...</font>

472
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,890
<font color="yellow">in those things.</font>

473
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,020
<font color="yellow">Happiness that I have not...</font>

474
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,250
<font color="yellow">felt yet.</font>

475
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,520
<font color="yellow">Those are feelings I've never learned...</font>

476
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,540
<font color="yellow">or experienced.</font>

477
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,890
<font color="yellow">You took on a risky surgery.</font>

478
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,720
<font color="yellow">Based on the results,</font>

479
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,390
<font color="yellow">you may be held responsible.</font>

480
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,590
<font color="yellow">I hope the radiation treatment works.</font>

481
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,490
<font color="yellow">Is that why you took the risk?</font>

482
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
<font color="yellow">Is it?</font>

483
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,150
<font color="yellow">Was it because of the patient's desperation?</font>

484
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,650
<font color="yellow">What I wanted from you...</font>

485
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,950
<font color="yellow">and what I wanted to do for you was...</font>

486
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,990
<font color="yellow">to spend time.</font>

487
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,730
<font color="yellow">I want to spend time with you.</font>

488
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,450
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you to buy him time.</font>

489
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,290
<font color="yellow">Time we can spend together.</font>

490
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,450
<font color="yellow">Please let him stay with me longer...</font>

491
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
<font color="yellow">so I can...</font>

492
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,490
<font color="yellow">see him...</font>

493
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
<font color="yellow">as long as possible.</font>

494
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,390
<font color="yellow">Time.</font>

495
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,420
<font color="yellow">Time to spend...</font>

496
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,550
<font color="yellow">with someone.</font>

497
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,260
<font color="yellow">- He's an emergency patient. Make way.
-  Oh, no.</font>

498
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,730
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

499
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,260
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I asked you to go out with me.</font>

500
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,690
<font color="yellow">I didn't know...</font>

501
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

502
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,390
<font color="yellow">Take him to his room and call Dr Lee Young Oh.</font>

503
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,390
<font color="yellow">- Please hurry.
-  Yes, Doctor.</font>

504
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,760
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

505
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,690
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

506
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,850
<font color="yellow">for nagging you to let me go out...</font>

507
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,290
<font color="yellow">despite your warning.</font>

508
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,550
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

509
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,990
<font color="yellow">not going to make it.</font>

510
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,020
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

511
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,920
<font color="yellow">I'll treat the tumour on your spine...</font>

512
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,820
<font color="yellow">with radiation treatment.</font>

513
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,050
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

514
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
<font color="yellow">let me...</font>

515
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,450
<font color="yellow">hold my baby just once.</font>

516
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,620
<font color="yellow">Stop talking.</font>

517
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,190
<font color="yellow">I already made you a promise.</font>

518
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,590
<font color="yellow">You say nice things...</font>

519
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,890
<font color="yellow">in such a mean way...</font>

520
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,450
<font color="yellow">just like my wife.</font>

521
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,390
<font color="yellow">You have to promise me...</font>

522
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,690
<font color="yellow">that you won't give up...</font>

523
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,290
<font color="yellow">and will follow my decisions on your treatment.</font>

524
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,450
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can do that?</font>

525
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,050
<font color="yellow">Dr Oh, I heard Dr Lee started the radiation treatment.</font>

526
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,350
<font color="yellow">I told you surgery wouldn't work.</font>

527
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,070
<font color="yellow">The patient desperately wanted the surgery.</font>

528
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,190
<font color="yellow">Should he have told the patient to give up?</font>

529
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,260
<font color="yellow">We should consider the risks.</font>

530
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,930
<font color="yellow">If patients don't recover,</font>

531
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,100
<font color="yellow">would they try to understand their doctors?</font>

532
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,990
<font color="yellow">The first thing they'd do is file a lawsuit.</font>

533
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,620
<font color="yellow">Sincerity always touches people's heart. Here you go.</font>

534
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,150
<font color="yellow">Sincerity?</font>

535
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
<font color="yellow">Sincerity?</font>

536
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,150
<font color="yellow">Can sincerity treat his tumour?</font>

537
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,020
<font color="yellow">Can you prevent side effects with sincerity?</font>

538
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,820
<font color="yellow">He's not in a condition to receive radiation treatment.</font>

539
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,760
<font color="yellow">He'll have oedema and difficulty in breathing.</font>

540
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,950
<font color="yellow">The radiation treatment caused the oedema. Don't worry.</font>

541
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,120
<font color="yellow">Put the oxygen mask on him.</font>

542
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,850
<font color="yellow">- Give him the medication.
-  Yes, Doctor.</font>

543
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,550
<font color="yellow">You didn't forget your promise, right?</font>

544
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,550
<font color="yellow">We'll continue your radiation treatment.</font>

545
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,260
<font color="yellow">Don't give up, okay?</font>

546
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,620
<font color="yellow">You're looking down on us, right?</font>

547
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,450
<font color="yellow">Is it because we don't have family or anyone else...</font>

548
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,550
<font color="yellow">Listen to me.</font>

549
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,950
<font color="yellow">There's no one else...</font>

550
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,850
<font color="yellow">but your husband who would adore you...</font>

551
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,390
<font color="yellow">when you act like a child.</font>

552
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,550
<font color="yellow">I, for one, can't stand it.</font>

553
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,390
<font color="yellow">I asked you to give me more time.</font>

554
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,220
<font color="yellow">What I need is...</font>

555
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,450
<font color="yellow">time to spend with him when he's okay.</font>

556
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,100
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see him in pain like that...</font>

557
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,790
<font color="yellow">lying in bed as if he were dead.</font>

558
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,350
<font color="yellow">I promised your husband...</font>

559
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,850
<font color="yellow">that I'll give him time to hold his baby in his arms.</font>

560
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,690
<font color="yellow">So I'm going to do everything I can.</font>

561
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,260
<font color="yellow">I need you to hang in there...</font>

562
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,320
<font color="yellow">just as your husband is doing.</font>

563
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,760
<font color="yellow">There's no miraculous treatment...</font>

564
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,420
<font color="yellow">in this world that can prolong his life...</font>

565
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,790
<font color="yellow">without pain.</font>

566
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,010
<font color="yellow">Now that Dr Lee doesn't cause trouble any more,</font>

567
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,720
<font color="yellow">Director Lee Gun Myung is giving me a headache.</font>

568
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,090
<font color="yellow">Is it a hereditary disease they have or something?</font>

569
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,790
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

570
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,820
<font color="yellow">Is he...</font>

571
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,920
<font color="yellow">refusing to hand over the regenerative medicine patent?</font>

572
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,650
<font color="yellow">He won't hold out for long.</font>

573
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,420
<font color="yellow">Director Lee Gun Myung has...</font>

574
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,220
<font color="yellow">What on earth is the dirty secret...</font>

575
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,850
<font color="yellow">that Director Lee is hiding?</font>

576
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,190
<font color="yellow">Is it related to Dr Lee Young Oh?</font>

577
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,420
<font color="yellow">Is he hiding secrets about Dr Lee's birth?</font>

578
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,190
<font color="yellow">A secret has power...</font>

579
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,150
<font color="yellow">only when it's a secret.</font>

580
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,220
<font color="yellow">We need to keep it a secret...</font>

581
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,020
<font color="yellow">because Director Lee wants it to remain that way.</font>

582
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,590
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

583
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,300
<font color="yellow">Do you want to satisfy your curiosity?</font>

584
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,920
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to make a deal?</font>

585
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,150
<font color="yellow">If I were you,</font>

586
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,650
<font color="yellow">I would choose to make a deal.</font>

587
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,720
<font color="yellow">We're doing a business.</font>

588
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,760
<font color="yellow">Try to be patient, Sir.</font>

589
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,450
<font color="yellow">How is the clinical trial going?</font>

590
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,050
<font color="yellow">This is the first stem cell treatment to be put to use.</font>

591
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,320
<font color="yellow">It's a heart muscle sheet.</font>

592
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,890
<font color="yellow">Who are the patients?</font>

593
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,320
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to treat patients...</font>

594
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,730
<font color="yellow">with cardiomyopathy and heart failure...</font>

595
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,020
<font color="yellow">to promote the efficiency and effectiveness...</font>

596
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,290
<font color="yellow">of stem cell treatment.</font>

597
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,390
<font color="yellow">I decided to follow your decision as you're in charge.</font>

598
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,390
<font color="yellow">I also desperately hope that you'll succeed...</font>

599
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,890
<font color="yellow">in commercialising the stem cell treatment.</font>

600
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,490
<font color="yellow">I believe you'll never hand over the patent...</font>

601
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,050
<font color="yellow">to the multinational pharmaceutical company.</font>

602
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,620
<font color="yellow">What we should do now is...</font>

603
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,760
<font color="yellow">to make the stem cell treatment safe to use.</font>

604
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,390
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun, let's focus on that for now.</font>

605
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
<font color="yellow">Ki Ho.</font>

606
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,810
<font color="yellow">Have you prepared the ECMO?</font>

607
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,080
<font color="yellow">Oh, that?</font>

608
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,420
<font color="yellow">The patients for our clinical trial have heart failure.</font>

609
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,390
<font color="yellow">Prepare the ECMO in case of an emergency.</font>

610
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

611
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,090
<font color="yellow">The safety of these patients...</font>

612
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,390
<font color="yellow">will decide the success of our research.</font>

613
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,790
<font color="yellow">Take good care of them.</font>

614
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,450
<font color="yellow">How is the patient doing?</font>

615
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,660
<font color="yellow">He developed a complication as expected.</font>

616
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,020
<font color="yellow">Does he have an infection?</font>

617
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,390
<font color="yellow">Yes. Dr Lee has been attending to the patient himself.</font>

618
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,690
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

619
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,820
<font color="yellow">His heart is failing due to stress.</font>

620
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,920
<font color="yellow">ECMO.</font>

621
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,720
<font color="yellow">I need the ECMO.</font>

622
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,790
<font color="yellow">ECMO?</font>

623
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,320
<font color="yellow">If I have the ECMO,</font>

624
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,220
<font color="yellow">I can buy some time.</font>

625
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,820
<font color="yellow">ECMO?</font>

626
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,990
<font color="yellow">How can I get it right now?</font>

627
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,190
<font color="yellow">We only have three in our hospital.</font>

628
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,260
<font color="yellow">One of them is...</font>

629
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,220
<font color="yellow">in the VIP room.</font>

630
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,320
<font color="yellow">I heard that another one is at the ICU.</font>

631
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,350
<font color="yellow">There's another one at Cardio,</font>

632
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,620
<font color="yellow">but Dr Hyun is in charge of it.</font>

633
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, have you seen my gown?</font>

634
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
<font color="yellow">It's complicated.</font>

635
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,150
<font color="yellow">What's the problem?</font>

636
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,390
<font color="yellow">We have a heart failure patient, too.</font>

637
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,660
<font color="yellow">We don't know how the situation will fluctuate.</font>

638
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,220
<font color="yellow">All due to your patient's uncertain status,</font>

639
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,020
<font color="yellow">my patient with imminent needs...</font>

640
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,320
<font color="yellow">should be let go?</font>

641
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,890
<font color="yellow">Is that what you're saying?</font>

642
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,790
<font color="yellow">There's only one ECMO, and to patients,</font>

643
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,590
<font color="yellow">it can be their lifeline.</font>

644
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,850
<font color="yellow">My clinical trial patient's well-being...</font>

645
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,190
<font color="yellow">is beyond my personal feelings.</font>

646
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,920
<font color="yellow">He has the full attention of the media.</font>

647
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,690
<font color="yellow">- Dr Yang.
-  Yes, Doctor?</font>

648
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,320
<font color="yellow">We're transferring the ECMO immediately.</font>

649
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,190
<font color="yellow">Yang Sung Eun!</font>

650
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,720
<font color="yellow">If something happens to my patient,</font>

651
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,990
<font color="yellow">all the efforts...</font>

652
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,290
<font color="yellow">will go down the drain in a single moment.</font>

653
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,420
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

654
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,890
<font color="yellow">This will be the first and last time...</font>

655
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,090
<font color="yellow">I will beg you.</font>

<font color="yellow">save my patient.</font>

659
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,490
<font color="yellow">You cannot.</font>

660
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,650
<font color="yellow">There is no chance for survival.</font>

661
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,750

662
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,590
<font color="yellow">Don't you choose patients...</font>

663
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,150
<font color="yellow">based on their probability of survival?</font>

664
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,690
<font color="yellow">I can't relinquish the ECMO to a patient...</font>

665
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,990
<font color="yellow">who has less than a 10 percent chance of survival.</font>

666

<font color="yellow">- Dr Lee.
-  What is going on?</font>

667
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,620
<font color="yellow">- Yang Sung Eun.
-  Yes, Doctor.</font>

668
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,520
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?</font>

669
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,950
<font color="yellow">I told you to move it.</font>

670
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,250
<font color="yellow">Whatever, I'm just going to do it.</font>

671
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,650
<font color="yellow">Hey, hold it.</font>

672
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,490
<font color="yellow">After what you just said,</font>

673
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,650
<font color="yellow">are you still...</font>

674
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,950
<font color="yellow">a good doctor?</font>

675
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,050
<font color="yellow">- Is the ECMO running well?
-  Yes.</font>

<font color="yellow">Mr Jo Yoon Ho.</font>

677
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,590

678
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,250
<font color="yellow">I'm keeping my promise.</font>

679
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,190
<font color="yellow">You should...</font>

<font color="yellow">for a patient with low survival probability.</font>

683

685
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,190
<font color="yellow">It's a very expensive piece of equipment.</font>

686

00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,250
<font color="yellow">I need to see you now.</font>

691
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,990
<font color="yellow">So you've made a decision?</font>

692
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,520
<font color="yellow">I decided to accept...</font>

<font color="yellow">patients to be alive...</font>

742
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,550
<font color="yellow">just because they breathe?</font>

01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,250
<font color="yellow">You are my only family.</font>

856
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,250
<font color="yellow">You taught me everything about life.</font>

<font color="yellow">what expression was I supposed to make?</font>

862
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,350
<font color="yellow">You never taught me...</font>

863
