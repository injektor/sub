<font color="yellow">My patient contracted pneumonia...</font>

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,510

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,020

16

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,610
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,910

21

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,720
<font color="yellow">The medical records show...</font>

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,880
<font color="yellow">that this patient had a gastrectomy in the past.</font>

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,160
<font color="yellow">The French L-tube that you ordered...</font>

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,010
<font color="yellow">was inappropriate for use in the first place.</font>

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,480
<font color="yellow">The French L-tube wasn't a good call.</font>

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,380
<font color="yellow">Let's do this.</font>

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,580
<font color="yellow">Prescribe her clindamycin for three weeks.</font>

29
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,840

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,910
<font color="yellow">He's got some nerve for a second-year resident.</font>

33

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,650
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,380
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry?</font>

37
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,780
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,380
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

39
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,620
<font color="yellow">There's a new chicken shop by the main gate.</font>

40
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,010
<font color="yellow">I heard it's delicious.</font>

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,580
<font color="yellow">The portions are a bit too large...</font>

<font color="yellow">for a woman to eat alone.</font>

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,310
<font color="yellow">I always wanted to pay the place a visit.</font>

44
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,050
<font color="yellow">I'm starving,</font>

45
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,210
<font color="yellow">but I don't know anyone here,</font>

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,480
<font color="yellow">so I'm reluctant to go alone.</font>

<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

51
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,280
<font color="yellow">Roll your hand, like this.</font>

52
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,680
<font color="yellow">Just like that.</font>

53
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,980
<font color="yellow">Why are your hands so drained of strength?</font>

54
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,710
<font color="yellow">Are you really that hungry?</font>

55
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

57
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,080

58
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,580
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and don't worry about me.</font>

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,180
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

60
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,780

61
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,510
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,450
<font color="yellow">Did you have enough fried chicken?</font>

63

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,110
<font color="yellow">Do you also...</font>

65
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,710
<font color="yellow">despise me that much?</font>

66
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,250
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,850
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm a lower-tier university graduate?</font>

68
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,280
<font color="yellow">Is it because I'm struggling to pay off my loans?</font>

69
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,010
<font color="yellow">Is that why you brush me off so easily...</font>

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,010

<font color="yellow">Stop pretending like you don't know...</font>

77
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,250
<font color="yellow">what I'm talking about.</font>

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,950
<font color="yellow">really enjoy being a neurosurgeon?</font>

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,910
<font color="yellow">The responsibilities are clearly defined.</font>

82
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,210

<font color="yellow">When it comes to asking me for dates,</font>

94

<font color="yellow">It's not interesting enough.</font>

159
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,980
<font color="yellow">That's the Korean psyche.</font>

160
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,260
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you must be devastated.</font>

161
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,110
<font color="yellow">I heard Mr Shin passed away suddenly.</font>

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,580
<font color="yellow">I heard an interesting story.</font>

163
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,930
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's bad news for Hyunsung Medical Centre.</font>

164
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Reporter Kim, let's go grab a cup of tea.</font>

165
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,410
<font color="yellow">Old sayings are never wrong.</font>

166
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
<font color="yellow">"Those who chase gossip are always hungry."</font>

167
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,310
<font color="yellow">Mr Chae,</font>

168
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,780
<font color="yellow">ask if he wants to lose our advertising sponsorship.</font>

169
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,100
<font color="yellow">Whether it's print or television broadcast,</font>

170
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,450
<font color="yellow">we'll withdraw everything.</font>

171
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,010
<font color="yellow">I don't live off Hyunsung Group's sponsorship.</font>

172
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,210
<font color="yellow">It's more than what I deserve.</font>

173
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,550
<font color="yellow">We live off the story-starved curiosity...</font>

174
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,250
<font color="yellow">of potential viewers.</font>

175
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,850
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, you'll be held liable for everything.</font>

176
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,210
<font color="yellow">Let's do it then. Let's meet the global standard.</font>

177
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,280
<font color="yellow">Let's go with that system of ethics you mentioned.</font>

178
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,780
<font color="yellow">You have one week...</font>

179
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,450
<font color="yellow">until the JCI evaluators arrive.</font>

180
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,050
<font color="yellow">Before the media gets their dirty hands on us,</font>

181
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,350
<font color="yellow">let's handle it internally...</font>

182
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,280
<font color="yellow">within Hyunsung Medical Centre.</font>

183
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,780
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the Mortality Conference, then.</font>

184
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,310
<font color="yellow">A child, age seven.</font>

185
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,080
<font color="yellow">She is a patient suffering from a cerebral aneurysm.</font>

186
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,430
<font color="yellow">She was admitted as Dr Hyun Suk Joo's patient.</font>

187
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,680
<font color="yellow">Is she a patient...</font>

188
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,500
<font color="yellow">under Dr Hyun Suk Joo's care?</font>

189
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,250
<font color="yellow">She's a family member of Dr Kim from Anaesthesiology.</font>

190
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,240
<font color="yellow">She received surgery for congenital valve deformity.</font>

191
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
<font color="yellow">She's also suffering from cyanoderma.</font>

192
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,250
<font color="yellow">Her cerebral thrombosis seems to have evolved...</font>

193
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,710
<font color="yellow">into an aneurysm as a cyanoderma complication.</font>

194
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,000
<font color="yellow">What did CS say?</font>

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

196
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,250
<font color="yellow">As the patient's guardian, Dr Kim wants surgery.</font>

197
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,650
<font color="yellow">That's dangerous.</font>

198
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,710
<font color="yellow">The size isn't ideal.</font>

199
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,680
<font color="yellow">The location makes things worse.</font>

200
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,760
<font color="yellow">Her heart will not endure the surgery.</font>

201
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,580
<font color="yellow">If it ruptures during surgery,</font>

202
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,710
<font color="yellow">she'll die immediately.</font>

203
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,710
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Dr Lee?</font>

204
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,350
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

205
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,880
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking him?</font>

206
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,310
<font color="yellow">Are we voting now?</font>

207
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,780
<font color="yellow">Hey, kid.</font>

208
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,980
<font color="yellow">- Tell her we can't operate.
-  Excuse me?</font>

209
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,480
<font color="yellow">Is that what I should tell her?</font>

210
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,650
<font color="yellow">It's a medical opinion given by specialists.</font>

211
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,480
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim will understand, too.</font>

212
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,180
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Dr Lee?</font>

213
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,640
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

214
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,240
<font color="yellow">It seems Dr Lee is mentally overloaded with thoughts...</font>

215
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,520
<font color="yellow">of who to accuse at the Mortality Conference.</font>

216
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,380
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you doing?</font>

217
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,910
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

218
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,350
<font color="yellow">Did you say that you will point out...</font>

219
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,350
<font color="yellow">the murderer at the Mortality Conference?</font>

220
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

221
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,780
<font color="yellow">As of this moment,</font>

222
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,080
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee and the surgical staff...</font>

223
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,510
<font color="yellow">present at Mr Shin's surgery...</font>

224
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,480
<font color="yellow">cannot operate on any surgeries...</font>

225
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,980
<font color="yellow">at Hyunsung Medical Centre.</font>

226
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,210
<font color="yellow">Even the surgical staff?</font>

227
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,880
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee,</font>

228
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,280
<font color="yellow">do you still hold me responsible...</font>

229
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,700
<font color="yellow">for the surgery of Mr Shin?</font>

230
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,580
<font color="yellow">How can anyone save a patient in an emergency...</font>

231
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,780
<font color="yellow">if the surgeon and the surgical staff...</font>

232
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,380
<font color="yellow">cannot trust each other?</font>

233
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,880
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's possible.</font>

234
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,110
<font color="yellow">Determine who's responsible for Mr Shin's death.</font>

235
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,550
<font color="yellow">I will not approve...</font>

236
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,970
<font color="yellow">of you to operate until then.</font>

237
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,510
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to give up on the surgery?</font>

238
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,550
<font color="yellow">You want me...</font>

239
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,140
<font color="yellow">to sit back and watch my daughter die?</font>

240
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,510
<font color="yellow">I'm a doctor,</font>

241
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,080
<font color="yellow">yet you want me to do nothing about it?</font>

242
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
<font color="yellow">Yoon Kyung.</font>

243
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,310
<font color="yellow">Yoon Kyung.</font>

244
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,780
<font color="yellow">Discuss this with your husband.</font>

245
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,510
<font color="yellow">We're divorced.</font>

246
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,080
<font color="yellow">Still, he should come since he's the father.</font>

247
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,780
<font color="yellow">I'm being punished.</font>

248
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,480
<font color="yellow">For the past several years...</font>

249
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,850
<font color="yellow">while waiting for Ji An's new heart,</font>

250
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,750
<font color="yellow">do you know what I prayed for the most?</font>

251
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,950
<font color="yellow">I desperately prayed for a donor every day,</font>

252
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,710
<font color="yellow">hoping that another child's accident would save my own.</font>

253
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,780
<font color="yellow">Are you doing undercover work?</font>

254
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,710
<font color="yellow">You're searching for a clue...</font>

255
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,450
<font color="yellow">that the criminal left, right?</font>

256
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,650
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

257
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,180
<font color="yellow">I have more than enough clues.</font>

258
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,050
<font color="yellow">The criminal knew Mr Shin well enough...</font>

259
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,110
<font color="yellow">to know that he was diabetic.</font>

260
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,030
<font color="yellow">He treated him with a lethal dose of pseudoephedrine...</font>

261
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,280
<font color="yellow">without raising any suspicions.</font>

262
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,910
<font color="yellow">That person had gained complete trust of Mr Shin.</font>

263
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,650
<font color="yellow">And the criminal was afraid that Mr Shin...</font>

264
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,510
<font color="yellow">would find out the truth about the heart...</font>

265
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,450
<font color="yellow">that went missing.</font>

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that...</font>

267
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,910
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun is guilty?</font>

268
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,630
<font color="yellow">I never pegged...</font>

269
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,140
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun as the criminal.</font>

270
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,450
<font color="yellow">Not even once.</font>

271
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,760
<font color="yellow">Aren't you, Officer Gye,</font>

272
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,010
<font color="yellow">the one who believes that Dr Hyun is the criminal.</font>

273
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,750
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

274
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,260
<font color="yellow">It's just you and me who believe this to be murder.</font>

275
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,580
<font color="yellow">Therefore, starting today,</font>

276
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,610
<font color="yellow">we are on the same team.</font>

277
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,280
<font color="yellow">Without my help,</font>

278
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,650
<font color="yellow">you won't be able to find out who killed Mr Shin.</font>

279
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,550
<font color="yellow">That is why...</font>

280
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,750
<font color="yellow">you need to help me...</font>

281
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,410
<font color="yellow">so that I can point out...</font>

282
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,550
<font color="yellow">the culprit...</font>

283
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,780
<font color="yellow">at the Mortality Conference.</font>

284
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,990
<font color="yellow">First, we need to retrace Dr Hyun's steps...</font>

285
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,780
<font color="yellow">when he went to meet...</font>

286
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,780
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin that night.</font>

287
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

288
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,870
<font color="yellow">There must be a record of the doctor...</font>

289
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,480
<font color="yellow">who secured a lethal dose of pseudoephedrine.</font>

290
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,380
<font color="yellow">"A prescription of pseudoephedrine".</font>

291
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,610
<font color="yellow">You aren't thinking that Dr Hyun would have...</font>

292
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,280
<font color="yellow">prescribed it under his name, are you?</font>

293
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,080
<font color="yellow">Isn't that obvious?</font>

294
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,880
<font color="yellow">Then, who do you think prescribed it?</font>

295
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,080
<font color="yellow">I'll only use it as a reference, so don't worry.</font>

296
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,280
<font color="yellow">If that's the case, I'll tell you.</font>

297
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,650
<font color="yellow">I'm not the police.</font>

298
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,110
<font color="yellow">You are.</font>

299
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,180
<font color="yellow">Officer Gye Jin Sung.</font>

300
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Hello, everyone.</font>

301
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,110
<font color="yellow">May I join you?</font>

302
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,980
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

303
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,880
<font color="yellow">You want me to question the hospital staff...</font>

304
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,850
<font color="yellow">to see if anyone was solicited by Dr Hyun?</font>

305
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,680
<font color="yellow">Is there anything wrong with that?</font>

306
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,750
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

307
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,480
<font color="yellow">they will take him as the murderer.</font>

308
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,750
<font color="yellow">Would that be all right?</font>

309
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,610
<font color="yellow">Pick one.</font>

310
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,850
<font color="yellow">Either act like an officer...</font>

311
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,550
<font color="yellow">or a girl who has a crush on him.</font>

312
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,910
<font color="yellow">You are the staff members...</font>

313
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,780
<font color="yellow">who participated in Mr Shin's surgery, right?</font>

314
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,050
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

315
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,560
<font color="yellow">in Kang Chul Min's surgery as well with Dr Hyun.</font>

316
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,680
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

317
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,560
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that Dr Hyun is the suspect?</font>

318
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,380
<font color="yellow">Among the staff members...</font>

319
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,150
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

320
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,320
<font color="yellow">You're the one closest to Dr Hyun.</font>

321
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,890
<font color="yellow">You're his patient.</font>

322
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,280
<font color="yellow">Shi Hyun, what are you doing?</font>

323
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,150
<font color="yellow">If the patient you saved accuses you as the criminal,</font>

324
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,510
<font color="yellow">would you still want to wear that doctor's gown?</font>

325
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,720
<font color="yellow">That is what you do for your job.</font>

326
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,310
<font color="yellow">This is how I do mine.</font>

327
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,670
<font color="yellow">I do this for the safety of the people.</font>

328
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,310
<font color="yellow">Then, do it right.</font>

329
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,680
<font color="yellow">I suspect Dr Lee more than anyone else.</font>

330
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,410
<font color="yellow">It seems that he's putting the responsibility...</font>

331
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,780
<font color="yellow">on others in order to cover his mistake during surgery.</font>

332
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,380
<font color="yellow">Did you hear about Dr Hyun?</font>

333
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh, the Mortality Conference better be over soon.</font>

334
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,410
<font color="yellow">The hospital feels gloomy and restless.</font>

335
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,080
<font color="yellow">I feel like I have to be as careful as a squirrel.</font>

336
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,130
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

337
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,510
<font color="yellow">People are not fond of doctors these days anyway.</font>

338
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,980
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun can't be...</font>

339
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,330
<font color="yellow">the criminal, right?</font>

340
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,540
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

341
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,290
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun isn't someone who would do that.</font>

342
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,610
<font color="yellow">That's like something out of a soap opera.</font>

343
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,080
<font color="yellow">Do you know why soap operas have high ratings?</font>

344
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,780
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

345
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,660
<font color="yellow">very rare,</font>

346
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,480
<font color="yellow">but it does happen once in a while.</font>

347
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,550
<font color="yellow">Why would Dr Hyun do that to Mr Shin?</font>

348
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,680
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

349
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,980
<font color="yellow">People are listening.</font>

350
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,980
<font color="yellow">There's no evidence yet.</font>

351
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,380
<font color="yellow">Of course there is.</font>

352
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,340
<font color="yellow">The art of medicine is based on evidence.</font>

353
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,980
<font color="yellow">- Dr Soh.
-  Yes.</font>

354
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,920
<font color="yellow">He was the operating surgeon for Kang Chul Min.</font>

355
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,460
<font color="yellow">The patient's heart went missing.</font>

356
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,380
<font color="yellow">He must have made a mistake during the surgery.</font>

357
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,480
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin found that out,</font>

358
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,750
<font color="yellow">so Dr Hyun...</font>

359
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,950
<font color="yellow">killed him.</font>

360
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,080
<font color="yellow">Is there anything I can help you with?</font>

361
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,750
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun, what I mean is...</font>

362
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,140
<font color="yellow">that science starts from forming a hypothesis.</font>

363
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,340
<font color="yellow">Can I check...</font>

364
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,680
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee's schedule?</font>

365
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,280
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee?</font>

366
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,150
<font color="yellow">I wonder where he is.</font>

367
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,250
<font color="yellow">All of his surgeries have been cancelled.</font>

368
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,380
<font color="yellow">You need to find circumstantial and physical evidence.</font>

369
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,510
<font color="yellow">I will find medical clues...</font>

370
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
<font color="yellow">so that he can't deny the charges.</font>

371
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,750
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

372
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,250
<font color="yellow">I'm going to invite him...</font>

373
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,010
<font color="yellow">to a place where I'm the most comfortable in.</font>

374
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,580
<font color="yellow">Most comfortable?</font>

375
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,880
<font color="yellow">This is a CT scan of Dr Kim's daughter.</font>

376
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,780
<font color="yellow">She has congenital valve deformity.</font>

377
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,380
<font color="yellow">Due to the failures of past surgeries,</font>

378
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,580
<font color="yellow">her organs faced necrosis...</font>

379
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,380
<font color="yellow">from inflammation and recurrence.</font>

380
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,550
<font color="yellow">She's been waiting for a heart for three years.</font>

381
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,080
<font color="yellow">There's a condition.</font>

382
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,580
<font color="yellow">I need you, Dr Hyun,</font>

383
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,750
<font color="yellow">for CS.</font>

384
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,380
<font color="yellow">I don't need anyone else.</font>

385
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,150
<font color="yellow">It's you I need, Dr Hyun.</font>

386
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,950
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's begin by meeting with the guardian.</font>

387
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,180
<font color="yellow">You can operate?</font>

388
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,380
<font color="yellow">Can you really save my child?</font>

389
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,880
<font color="yellow">I plan to stop the heart.</font>

390
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,650
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

391
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,850
<font color="yellow">If the heart is stopped,</font>

392
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,730
<font color="yellow">the blood flowing to the cerebral aneurysm...</font>

393
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,950
<font color="yellow">will be reduced.</font>

394
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,450
<font color="yellow">It's the only way to prevent it from rupturing.</font>

395
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,970
<font color="yellow">It looks highly risky.</font>

396
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,710
<font color="yellow">The bypass will minimise the damage to the heart,</font>

397
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,910
<font color="yellow">but if my fingertips mistakenly touches a blood vessel,</font>

398
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,180
<font color="yellow">if the bypass duration is prolonged...</font>

399
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,610
<font color="yellow">or if the anesthesiologist makes a mistake...</font>

400
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,310
<font color="yellow">while monitoring the heart,</font>

401
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,010
<font color="yellow">she will...</font>

402
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,780
<font color="yellow">die on the table.</font>

403
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,610
<font color="yellow">Please promise me.</font>

404
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,510
<font color="yellow">Please let me...</font>

405
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,980
<font color="yellow">hold my girl every day after the surgery.</font>

406
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,750
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

407
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,910
<font color="yellow">I don't decide this surgery.</font>

408
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,250
<font color="yellow">You do, Dr Kim.</font>

409
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,380
<font color="yellow">You are the guardian.</font>

410
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,780
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

411
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,780
<font color="yellow">I had my reasons for prohibiting Dr Lee from operating.</font>

412
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,250
<font color="yellow">He's the only one willing to operate on my child.</font>

413
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,350
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

414
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,110
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee...</font>

415
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,330
<font color="yellow">openly suspects you and the operating staff...</font>

416
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,410
<font color="yellow">as the murderer.</font>

417
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,080
<font color="yellow">Is that all right with you?</font>

418
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,910
<font color="yellow">If by chance...</font>

419
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,050
<font color="yellow">that surgery was murder...</font>

420
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,010
<font color="yellow">as he claims,</font>

421
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,850
<font color="yellow">he is the first person who will be suspected.</font>

422
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,880
<font color="yellow">Is that all right with you as well?</font>

423
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,510
<font color="yellow">Please permit it.</font>

424
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,610
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

425
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,610
<font color="yellow">I won't...</font>

426
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,350
<font color="yellow">You need to save my child.</font>

427
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
<font color="yellow">You can't...</font>

428

<font color="yellow">telling me to do nothing and watch her die?</font>

434
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,880
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can't do.</font>

435
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,230
<font color="yellow">Please, I'm begging you.</font>

446

<font color="yellow">asked for you specifically?</font>

447
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,710

00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,380
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

472
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,080
<font color="yellow">I don't see the source of the aneurysm.</font>

473
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,890
<font color="yellow">If we continue as is,</font>

474
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,890

<font color="yellow">- Then...
-  In that four minutes,</font>

477
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,410
<font color="yellow">I will clip the artery and stop the blood flow...</font>

478
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,240
<font color="yellow">and start over from the beginning. Hurry.</font>

479
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,750
<font color="yellow">We have under five minutes...</font>

480
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,420
<font color="yellow">to use the bypass without damaging the heart.</font>

481
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,150
<font color="yellow">Any longer and we won't be successful...</font>

484
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,160
<font color="yellow">The heart will stop before we remove the bypass.</font>

485
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,780
<font color="yellow">The brain will be without oxygen...</font>

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,910
<font color="yellow">I already know that!</font>

489
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,450
<font color="yellow">Set the timer. I'll finish it in four minutes.</font>

490
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,450
<font color="yellow">Now!</font>

<font color="yellow">Suction!</font>

493
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,910
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

494
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,310
<font color="yellow">One minute on the clock.</font>

495
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,580

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

497
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,780
<font color="yellow">We've clipped it.</font>

498
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,710
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,980
<font color="yellow">Is the heart hanging in there...</font>

501
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,080
<font color="yellow">without problem?</font>

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,450
<font color="yellow">As of now,</font>

503
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,680
<font color="yellow">it is doing fine.</font>

504
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,480
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, it's our turn now.</font>

505
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,850
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee. We will stop the bypass now.</font>

506
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,580
<font color="yellow">Raise the temperature please.</font>

507
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,050
<font color="yellow">We've removed the cannula.</font>

508
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,080
<font color="yellow">We'll seal her up now.</font>

509
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,010
<font color="yellow">Ji An, thanks for hanging in here.</font>

510
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,650
<font color="yellow">Good job, Dr Kim.</font>

511
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,910
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dr Hyun.</font>

512
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,610
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

513
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,350
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

514
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,040
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

515
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,700
<font color="yellow">I thank you from the bottom of my heart...</font>

516
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,650
<font color="yellow">for not giving up on Ji An.</font>

517
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,310
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't thank me.</font>

518
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,450
<font color="yellow">The person who didn't give up and made this possible...</font>

519
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,910
<font color="yellow">was you, Dr Kim.</font>

520
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,150
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

521
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,080
<font color="yellow">Was Dr Hyun the attending the entire time?</font>

522
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, he was.</font>

523
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,750
<font color="yellow">Did he do all the treatments?</font>

524
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,750
<font color="yellow">Without missing a single one?</font>

525
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,310
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim.</font>

526
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

527
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,610
<font color="yellow">It was Dr Hyun Suk Joo.</font>

528
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,150
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

529
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,410
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

530
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,850
<font color="yellow">Flustered.</font>

531
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,380
<font color="yellow">A secret she cannot tell.</font>

532
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,910
<font color="yellow">Guilt.</font>

533
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,620
<font color="yellow">She made eye contact to hide that she's lying.</font>

534
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,910
<font color="yellow">She clasped her hands together.</font>

535
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,850
<font color="yellow">People do it when they want to believe their own lie.</font>

536
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,950
<font color="yellow">My suspicion was correct.</font>

537
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,210
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

538
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,350
<font color="yellow">not the one who killed...</font>

539
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,150
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin.</font>

540
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,750
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

541
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,780
<font color="yellow">I just confirmed that you did not steal...</font>

542
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,080
<font color="yellow">Kang Chul Min's heart...</font>

543
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,150
<font color="yellow">in the operating room.</font>

544
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,590
<font color="yellow">This patient's heart...</font>

545
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,150
<font color="yellow">had the same rare lesion as Kang Chul Min.</font>

546
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,250
<font color="yellow">You look like you had no idea.</font>

547
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,650
<font color="yellow">I needed those four minutes...</font>

548
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,920
<font color="yellow">to be absolutely sure.</font>

549
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,450
<font color="yellow">I already know that!</font>

550
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,960
<font color="yellow">Set the timer. I'll finish it in four minutes. Now!</font>

551
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,910
<font color="yellow">Because if you were the one who killed Mr Shin...</font>

552
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,680
<font color="yellow">and had taken Kang Chul Min's heart,</font>

553
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,780
<font color="yellow">you would've been flustered when you saw...</font>

554
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,880
<font color="yellow">the same lesion on the heart.</font>

555
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,910
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

556
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,910
<font color="yellow">Is that why you needed me for this surgery?</font>

557
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,310
<font color="yellow">You needed an emergency situation.</font>

558
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,070
<font color="yellow">You fooled everyone in the OR.</font>

559
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,510
<font color="yellow">As for the cerebral aneurysm,</font>

560
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,130
<font color="yellow">I had already clipped it before the four minutes began.</font>

561
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,550
<font color="yellow">The child was safe.</font>

562
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,580
<font color="yellow">It's a happy ending.</font>

563
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,490
<font color="yellow">From the start,</font>

564
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,310
<font color="yellow">you were suspicious about Kang Chul Min's death.</font>

565
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,350
<font color="yellow">But you didn't know then and now...</font>

566
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,370
<font color="yellow">that there was a rare lesion.</font>

567
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,580
<font color="yellow">During that time,</font>

568
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,120
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin, whom you respected,</font>

569
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,650
<font color="yellow">died because of that secret.</font>

570
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

571
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,710
<font color="yellow">really a good doctor?</font>

572
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,780
<font color="yellow">As much as people think?</font>

573
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,310
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee was very curious about Ji An's treatments.</font>

574
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,410
<font color="yellow">He asked if Dr Hyun was her attending...</font>

575
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,680
<font color="yellow">and seemed to want to verify something.</font>

576
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,010
<font color="yellow">I don't know...</font>

577
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,580
<font color="yellow">how long I can keep this a secret.</font>

578
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,330
<font color="yellow">Can we find out...</font>

579
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,550
<font color="yellow">what caused that lesion?</font>

580
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,780
<font color="yellow">Do you need it for the Mortality Conference?</font>

581
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,280
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

582
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,680
<font color="yellow">I'm a professional after all.</font>

583
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,120
<font color="yellow">For Kang Chul Min, it was necessary for surgery,</font>

584
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,880
<font color="yellow">but beyond that...</font>

585
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,150
<font color="yellow">Sorry I can't be of help.</font>

586
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,310
<font color="yellow">You've got me wrong.</font>

587
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,750
<font color="yellow">I was trying to help you.</font>

588
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,650
<font color="yellow">Why don't I remember...</font>

589
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,780
<font color="yellow">any of your articles?</font>

590
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,650
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

591
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,080
<font color="yellow">Patient Kang Chul Min.</font>

592
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,910
<font color="yellow">When his heart first disappeared,</font>

593
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,880
<font color="yellow">I thought it was one doctor's act.</font>

594
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,620
<font color="yellow">However, Mr Shin died...</font>

595
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,980
<font color="yellow">and the same lesion...</font>

596
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,550
<font color="yellow">was discovered on another child.</font>

597
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,580
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is a coincidence?</font>

598
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,010
<font color="yellow">That third lesion holds the answer.</font>

599
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,380
<font color="yellow">You will be...</font>

600
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,780
<font color="yellow">the star who discovers the cause.</font>

601
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,980
<font color="yellow">All the media and academia...</font>

602
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,510
<font color="yellow">will focus on your research article.</font>

603
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,650
<font color="yellow">If it's something that the medical field...</font>

604
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,510
<font color="yellow">will be interested in,</font>

605
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,280
<font color="yellow">I'm all for it.</font>

606
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,280
<font color="yellow">It's the responsibility of a scholar.</font>

607
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,950
<font color="yellow">I just need to check its immune response...</font>

608
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,380
<font color="yellow">and its reaction to different drugs,</font>

609
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,910
<font color="yellow">so give me a day.</font>

610
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,280
<font color="yellow">- Ki Ho.
-  Yes, Doctor?</font>

611
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,350
<font color="yellow">Our research...</font>

612
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,980
<font color="yellow">is going well, right?</font>

613
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,250
<font color="yellow">We are ready to file for a patent...</font>

614
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,380
<font color="yellow">once we get the accreditation from JCI.</font>

615
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,250
<font color="yellow">The stem cell article is scheduled to publish...</font>

616
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,250
<font color="yellow">at the same time, too.</font>

617
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,450
<font color="yellow">Does that mean it's going well?</font>

618
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,150
<font color="yellow">Companies from China push their way in with money,</font>

619
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,410
<font color="yellow">but we won't lose the title as the first in Asia.</font>

620
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,620
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

621
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,450
<font color="yellow">Get back to work.</font>

622
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,910
<font color="yellow">What do you really want to know,</font>

623
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,580
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun?</font>

624
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,850
<font color="yellow">I looked over...</font>

625
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,880
<font color="yellow">the test subjects' treatment records.</font>

626
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,780
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

627
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,250
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

628
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,680
<font color="yellow">There is no problem.</font>

629
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,780
<font color="yellow">That concerns me more.</font>

630
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,550
<font color="yellow">To me, this regenerative medicine...</font>

631
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,380
<font color="yellow">is the late Director Shin Dong Jae's life.</font>

632
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,780
<font color="yellow">There cannot be...</font>

633
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,180
<font color="yellow">and must not be any problems.</font>

634
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,710
<font color="yellow">I've put...</font>

635
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,780
<font color="yellow">the rest of my life on the line.</font>

636
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,510
<font color="yellow">Hi, Min Jae.</font>

637
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,780
<font color="yellow">You wanted to meet my dad, right?</font>

638
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,580
<font color="yellow">Let's do it.</font>

639
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,750
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

640
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,450
<font color="yellow">You told me to find out who prescribed pseudoephedrine.</font>

641
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,780
<font color="yellow">Here. Take a look.</font>

642
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,780
<font color="yellow">Look closely.</font>

643
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,700
<font color="yellow">See if there's a clue...</font>

644
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,410
<font color="yellow">that shows Dr Hyun gave him the drug.</font>

645
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,010
<font color="yellow">So you did all this...</font>

646
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,250
<font color="yellow">to look for clues to prove that Dr Hyun did it...</font>

647
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,250
<font color="yellow">just as I asked.</font>

648
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,650
<font color="yellow">Looking like that, at this hour, this inefficiently.</font>

649
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,980
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

650
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,650
<font color="yellow">I wanted to prove that Dr Hyun...</font>

651
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,780
<font color="yellow">did not do it.</font>

652
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,820
<font color="yellow">I checked all the security footages...</font>

653
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,550
<font color="yellow">and Mr Shin's call records.</font>

654
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,620
<font color="yellow">I checked Kang Chul Min's medical records, too.</font>

655
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,220
<font color="yellow">I questioned the staff from the surgery,</font>

656
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,770
<font color="yellow">and there's no way Dr Hyun...</font>

657
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,250
<font color="yellow">met with the director that night.</font>

658
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,310
<font color="yellow">Therefore,</font>

659
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,120
<font color="yellow">whatever leads you found in the OR,</font>

660
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,010
<font color="yellow">you need to rethink things.</font>

661
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,850
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun is not the killer.</font>

662
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,710
<font color="yellow">He is...</font>

663
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,750
<font color="yellow">too good of a person to do something like that.</font>

664
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,150
<font color="yellow">Listen to me.</font>

665
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,510
<font color="yellow">There's no one like that in the world.</font>

666
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,550
<font color="yellow">In this world,</font>

667
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,200
<font color="yellow">there are only two types of people.</font>

668
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,100
<font color="yellow">Those who have failed to hide their true selves...</font>

669
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,780
<font color="yellow">and those who haven't failed yet.</font>

670
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,480
<font color="yellow">If Dr Hyun is all you have to talk about,</font>

671
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,550
<font color="yellow">you can go now.</font>

672
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,620
<font color="yellow">I already knew that he wasn't the killer.</font>

673
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,110
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

674
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

675
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,150
<font color="yellow">Then why did you tell me...</font>

676
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,110
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun has been misunderstood because of you.</font>

677
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,580
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

678
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,850
<font color="yellow">Why on earth?</font>

679
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,110
<font color="yellow">I wanted the killer...</font>

680
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,610
<font color="yellow">to think that he or she was off the hook.</font>

681
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,450
<font color="yellow">Does that hurt?</font>

682
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,050
<font color="yellow">You're the one going around hurting everyone.</font>

683
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,050
<font color="yellow">And that hurts?</font>

684
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,780
<font color="yellow">You have never...</font>

685
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,680
<font color="yellow">given your heart to someone, have you?</font>

686
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,610
<font color="yellow">You've never accepted someone's heart either, right?</font>

687
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,110
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you defend yourself?</font>

688
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,040
<font color="yellow">You could have said...</font>

689
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,710
<font color="yellow">that you didn't kill him.</font>

690
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,710
<font color="yellow">If I had, all the staff in this hospital...</font>

691
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,850
<font color="yellow">would have suspected each other.</font>

692
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,450
<font color="yellow">It would've been a nightmare.</font>

693
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,580
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

694
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,280
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

695
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,050
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

696
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,980
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

697
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

698
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,780
<font color="yellow">I will tell...</font>

699
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,480
<font color="yellow">each and every person in this hospital...</font>

700
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,780
<font color="yellow">that I was wrong about everything.</font>

701
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
<font color="yellow">You can...</font>

702
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,780
<font color="yellow">hate me for the rest of your life.</font>

703
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,850
<font color="yellow">I will... I won't hate you or anything like that.</font>

704
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,150
<font color="yellow">I won't speak ill of you, either.</font>

705
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,380
<font color="yellow">Who says I'll keep you around?</font>

706
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,850
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

707
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,180
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

708
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,610
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat something.</font>

709
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,510
<font color="yellow">Hey. What's wrong?</font>

710
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:19,780
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Let's go.</font>

711
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,780
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

712
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,350
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

713
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,740
<font color="yellow">- Father.
-  Yes.</font>

714
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,750
<font color="yellow">We're getting married.</font>

715
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,110
<font color="yellow">We should have told you earlier. I'm sorry.</font>

716
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,350
<font color="yellow">That's unexpected.</font>

717
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't expect good news at a time like this.</font>

718
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,250
<font color="yellow">I thought I wouldn't have a chance to tell you...</font>

719
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,610
<font color="yellow">after the Mortality Conference.</font>

720
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:52,180
<font color="yellow">How well do you know my son, Dr Kim?</font>

721
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:58,780
<font color="yellow">I could write a PhD thesis about him.</font>

722
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,410
<font color="yellow">Please don't ask her hard questions.</font>

723
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,480
<font color="yellow">She must be really nervous right now.</font>

724
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,350
<font color="yellow">Her future father-in-law is...</font>

725
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,140
<font color="yellow">a man whom all the fellow doctors trust and admire.</font>

726
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,410
<font color="yellow">He is moral and dignified.</font>

727
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,050
<font color="yellow">He's Lee Gun Myung, the head of the centre.</font>

728
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,670
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

729
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,780
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

730
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,310
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking?</font>

731
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,150
<font color="yellow">It's too risky to live with her.</font>

732
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,130
<font color="yellow">Is that because...</font>

733
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,750
<font color="yellow">she's a neuroscientist who wrote...</font>

734
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,480
<font color="yellow">a great thesis about the relationship...</font>

735
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,210
<font color="yellow">between brain science and morality?</font>

736
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,610
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid she might find out about me?</font>

737
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,780
<font color="yellow">In the past 10 years,</font>

738
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,680
<font color="yellow">I have been...</font>

739
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,970
<font color="yellow">an ordinary man to Dr Kim.</font>

740
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,380
<font color="yellow">- Still...
-  I'll do my best...</font>

741
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,250
<font color="yellow">to make her happy for the rest of my life.</font>

742
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,310
<font color="yellow">Then people will consider me normal.</font>

743
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,580
<font color="yellow">Just as you wish.</font>

744
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,280
<font color="yellow">Did you make any progress...</font>

745
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,150
<font color="yellow">with the preparation for the conference?</font>

746
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

747
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,250
<font color="yellow">It's getting more and more interesting.</font>

748
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,760
<font color="yellow">Look forward to it, Father.</font>

749
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,780
<font color="yellow">Could you at least pretend in public places?</font>

750
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,380
<font color="yellow">Normal people...</font>

751
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,980
<font color="yellow">don't describe someone's death...</font>

752
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,310
<font color="yellow">as something interesting.</font>

753
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:41,180
<font color="yellow">Isn't death...</font>

754
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,350
<font color="yellow">like losing?</font>

755
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,430
<font color="yellow">It's being defeated.</font>

756
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,210
<font color="yellow">Doctors lose to diseases.</font>

757
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,220
<font color="yellow">People lose to ageing.</font>

758
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, and there are...</font>

759
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,780
<font color="yellow">people like the director...</font>

760
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,210
<font color="yellow">who are betrayed by someone whom they trusted.</font>

761
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,380
<font color="yellow">It's just the way of the world...</font>

762
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,570
<font color="yellow">that the strongest survive.</font>

763
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,780
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

764
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,270
<font color="yellow">If death is such a great thing,</font>

765
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,780
<font color="yellow">you and I should quit being doctors.</font>

766
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,450
<font color="yellow">Doctors should dedicate their lives to save...</font>

767
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,180
<font color="yellow">as many lives as possible and for the sanctity of life.</font>

768
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,450
<font color="yellow">That's what you used to tell me all the time.</font>

769
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,480
<font color="yellow">Did you change your mind?</font>

770
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,050
<font color="yellow">However, I will follow what you have taught me.</font>

771
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,110
<font color="yellow">The person who dared to corrupt my OR...</font>

772
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,580
<font color="yellow">in order to murder the director, Shin Dong Jae,</font>

773
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,280
<font color="yellow">is still living with his head held high.</font>

774
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,110
<font color="yellow">I will point him out during the conference.</font>

775
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,250
<font color="yellow">At all costs.</font>

776
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,280
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the conference.</font>

777
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:19,150
<font color="yellow">I would like to move up the Mortality Conference...</font>

778
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,180
<font color="yellow">to tomorrow.</font>

779
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,080
<font color="yellow">As if I'd go there...</font>

<font color="yellow">(The conference has been advanced to 4pm on June 28.)</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>
