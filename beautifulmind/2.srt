00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
<font color="yellow">Sir,</font>

158
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,770
<font color="yellow">I'm on your side.</font>

159
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,670
<font color="yellow">Next time,</font>

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,230
<font color="yellow">you need to slit your wrist along the ulnar artery.</font>

161
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
<font color="yellow">From the top...</font>

162
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
<font color="yellow">to the bottom.</font>

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,770
<font color="yellow">You need to slit exactly from here to here.</font>

164
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,970
<font color="yellow">After two minutes,</font>

165
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,170
<font color="yellow">you will be pronounced dead.</font>

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,870
<font color="yellow">That's what you wanted, right?</font>

167
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,340
<font color="yellow">This doesn't show me that you really mean it.</font>

168
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,790
<font color="yellow">You lack decisiveness.</font>

169
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,530
<font color="yellow">It's very sloppy.</font>

170
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,890
<font color="yellow">- Stop him!
- Let go!</font>

171
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,620
<font color="yellow">- Let me go!
- Stop him!</font>

172
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,790
<font color="yellow">Stop...</font>

173
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,800
<font color="yellow">the patient!</font>

174
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,600
<font color="yellow">Hold him down!</font>

175
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
<font color="yellow">Let me go!</font>

176
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,400
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee. What's the matter?</font>

177
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,370
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

178
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,330
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine if you can get this patient off of me.</font>

179
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,130
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

180
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,400
<font color="yellow">What a funny way of saying thank you.</font>

181
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,700
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that...</font>

182
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,430
<font color="yellow">we're even now for what happened last night.</font>

183
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

185
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,800
<font color="yellow">you have a lot to say to me about last night.</font>

186
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,630
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

187
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,330
<font color="yellow">I guess you're right.</font>

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you think we need some privacy?</font>

189
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

190
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,830
<font color="yellow">It's not what it looks like.</font>

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,370
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee!</font>

192
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,960
<font color="yellow">My heart is about to pop out of my chest.</font>

193
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
<font color="yellow">What in the world...</font>

194
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,700
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- Excuse me?</font>

195
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,600
<font color="yellow">It's not just my heart that beats this fast, right?</font>

196
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,070
<font color="yellow">Isn't it normal for your heart to be pounding in this situation?</font>

197
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, that would be normal for most people.</font>

198
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,280
<font color="yellow">Are you into me?</font>

199
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,730
<font color="yellow">I'm really flattered,</font>

200
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,000
<font color="yellow">but I need to ask my mum...</font>

201
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,000
<font color="yellow">Ms Lee.</font>

202
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,900
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

203
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,600
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

204
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

205
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,300
<font color="yellow">Should we continue our conversation from last night?</font>

206
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,700
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,300
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

208
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,070
<font color="yellow">Why is the missing surgery footage...</font>

209
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,170
<font color="yellow">in your office?</font>

210
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,670
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun also has a copy of that surgery footage.</font>

211
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,300
<font color="yellow">I watched the surveillance video of the morgue and saw you there.</font>

212
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,200
<font color="yellow">So you're saying that I killed the patient during surgery...</font>

213
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,170
<font color="yellow">and destroyed the evidence.</font>

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,170
<font color="yellow">Yet, you followed me all this way.</font>

215
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,770
<font color="yellow">Aren't you scared?</font>

216
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,630
<font color="yellow">This place doesn't have surveillance cameras. It's a blind spot.</font>

217
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,830
<font color="yellow">What if I lured you here on purpose?</font>

218
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,510
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

219
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,150
<font color="yellow">You know everything about this case,</font>

220
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,400
<font color="yellow">and you suspect me as the murderer.</font>

221
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,570
<font color="yellow">We are...</font>

222
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,070
<font color="yellow">the only ones here.</font>

223
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,200
<font color="yellow">You may find it unfair, but no one will suspect me.</font>

224
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,330
<font color="yellow">I'm a doctor who saved your life.</font>

225
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,570
<font color="yellow">Do you really think people will suspect me as the murderer?</font>

226
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,670
<font color="yellow">Will Hyunsung Medical Centre...</font>

227
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,470
<font color="yellow">allow such suspicion?</font>

228
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,200
<font color="yellow">Is that why you saved me?</font>

229
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,460
<font color="yellow">You will never be able to investigate and reveal...</font>

230
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,300
<font color="yellow">what happened in the operating room that day.</font>

231
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,000
<font color="yellow">A person should live up to their title.</font>

232
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,570
<font color="yellow">A doctor saves people's lives.</font>

233
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,400
<font color="yellow">A police officer catches bad guys.</font>

234
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,800
<font color="yellow">Just wait and see.</font>

235
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,730
<font color="yellow">I will let the world know...</font>

236
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,730
<font color="yellow">what you've done.</font>

237
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,600
<font color="yellow">Nobody will be on your side then.</font>

238
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,100
<font color="yellow">Not the doctors in this hospital,</font>

239
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,900
<font color="yellow">and not even the hospital.</font>

240
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,470
<font color="yellow">You are all here for the patients.</font>

241
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,100
<font color="yellow">That's what I believe.</font>

242
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,330
<font color="yellow">The word "believe" means it doesn't exist in this world.</font>

243
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,170
<font color="yellow">"I believe in Santa Claus."</font>

244
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,430
<font color="yellow">"I believe in a higher being."</font>

245
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,200
<font color="yellow">"I believe in love."</font>

246
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,770
<font color="yellow">You believe hospitals exist for the sake of patients.</font>

247
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,100
<font color="yellow">I also believe that,</font>

248
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,830
<font color="yellow">Officer Gye Jin Sung.</font>

249
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,370
<font color="yellow">What happened to Kang Chul Min was unfortunate.</font>

250
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,800
<font color="yellow">So what? It's over now!</font>

251
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,100
<font color="yellow">Sergeant Park!</font>

252
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,080
<font color="yellow">The hit-and-run of a stolen car lacked evidence,</font>

253
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,170
<font color="yellow">so we couldn't proceed with the case any further.</font>

254
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,180
<font color="yellow">All evidence was destroyed because the car was scrapped.</font>

255
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,700
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, Case 70-37...</font>

256
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
<font color="yellow">will remain a cold case.</font>

257
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,170
<font color="yellow">There's more behind this case!</font>

258
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,870
<font color="yellow">The body was switched at the hospital.</font>

259
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,590
<font color="yellow">You're the only one that thinks that.</font>

260
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,070
<font color="yellow">You don't have any evidence.</font>

261
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,840
<font color="yellow">"Police go by the case and is evaluated upon performance."</font>

262
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,170
<font color="yellow">"Central Police Station".</font>

263
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,590
<font color="yellow">Traffic Division has already closed this case,</font>

264
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,730
<font color="yellow">Officer Gye Jin Sung.</font>

265
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,600
<font color="yellow">- Will you approve...
- It's hot!</font>

266
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,240
<font color="yellow">if I bring evidence of murder?</font>

267
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,370
<font color="yellow">Transfer this case to Violent Crimes Division so I can find the murderer.</font>

268
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,660
<font color="yellow">If you act independently,</font>

269
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,810
<font color="yellow">I'll write you up as being absent without due notice.</font>

270
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,140
<font color="yellow">Officer Ji, did you hear me?</font>

271
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,260
<font color="yellow">Did you say that Traffic Division has already closed the case?</font>

272
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,430
<font color="yellow">How can it be over already?</font>

273
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,100
<font color="yellow">The victim is dead but his family cannot accept his death.</font>

274
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,170
<font color="yellow">We haven't even started investigating this case.</font>

275
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,500
<font color="yellow">Besides,</font>

276
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,730
<font color="yellow">I'm the only witness.</font>

277
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,840
<font color="yellow">Sergeant Park.</font>

278
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,640
<font color="yellow">I studied for seven years to become a police officer.</font>

279
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,960
<font color="yellow">I gave up on dating, relationships and men.</font>

280
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,670
<font color="yellow">All I did was study.</font>

281
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,430
<font color="yellow">That's why I'd like to solve this case...</font>

282
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,430
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to live as a cop who didn't even try.</font>

283
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,570
<font color="yellow">Could you give me...</font>

284
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,000
<font color="yellow">just one more day to find the evidence of murder?</font>

285
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
<font color="yellow">Please, Sergeant Park.</font>

286
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,340
<font color="yellow">Officer Ji, you heard her.</font>

287
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,700
<font color="yellow">Put her down...</font>

288
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,570
<font color="yellow">as taking paid vacation.</font>

289
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,050
<font color="yellow">What you're doing is not our jurisdiction,</font>

290
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,200
<font color="yellow">so you won't be getting extra pay.</font>

291
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,900
<font color="yellow">Sergeant Park.</font>

292
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,450
<font color="yellow">Go by the case.</font>

293
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,770
<font color="yellow">I will evaluate you based on your performance.</font>

294
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

295
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,500
<font color="yellow">She sure is something else.</font>

296
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
<font color="yellow">I am Officer Gye Jin Sung from Central Police Station.</font>

297
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,980
<font color="yellow">We cannot release any documents...</font>

298
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,500
<font color="yellow">without a warrant.</font>

299
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,700
<font color="yellow">We have high expectations for this surgery.</font>

300
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,730
<font color="yellow">If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.</font>

301
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,970
<font color="yellow">Director Shin.</font>

302
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,370
<font color="yellow">Officer Gye.</font>

303
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,630
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

304
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,000
<font color="yellow">I'd like to discuss something with you.</font>

305
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,300
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

306
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,900
<font color="yellow">Could you talk to Dr Hyun instead?</font>

307
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
<font color="yellow">I'm quite busy today.</font>

308
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,600
<font color="yellow">- It's about Dr Lee.
- What?</font>

309
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,970
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about the surgeon who will operate on Mr Kim?</font>

310
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
<font color="yellow">Are you?</font>

311
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,000

313
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,430

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,070
<font color="yellow">All right. I will especially show you the press release regarding...</font>

406
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,530

<font color="yellow">to divert the blood flow...</font>

420

<font color="yellow">and make the aorta expire on its own.</font>

421

431

<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

432
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,600
<font color="yellow">The proof is undeniable. He was caught on camera.</font>

433
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,230
<font color="yellow">On camera? Whatever.</font>

434

435
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,780
<font color="yellow">Don't criminals cover the camera first?</font>

436
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,200
<font color="yellow">But he smiled.</font>

437
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,670
<font color="yellow">He smiled.</font>

438
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,700
<font color="yellow">Smile. Just like that.</font>

439
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,530

<font color="yellow">that's what's weird.</font>

441
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,030
<font color="yellow">Wait. Do you think...</font>

442
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,460
<font color="yellow">he had the arrogance to think it was the perfect murder...</font>

443
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,340
<font color="yellow">- or something like that?
- You're right.</font>

444
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,670
<font color="yellow">Let's look up his past.</font>

445
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,670
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.</font>

446
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,130
<font color="yellow">- Perfect murder.
- Let's stop...</font>

447
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,900
<font color="yellow">the ridiculous deductions now.</font>

448
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,170
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say.</font>

449
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,600
<font color="yellow">I heard they will fire employees for their social network posts,</font>

450
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,700
<font color="yellow">and I believe it.</font>

451

<font color="yellow">I'd like to hear your opinion.</font>

453
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,160

456
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,670
<font color="yellow">Just ask. What is it?</font>

457
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,690
<font color="yellow">There are so many options,</font>

458
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,060
<font color="yellow">and I have no experience,</font>

459
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,270
<font color="yellow">so it's difficult.</font>

460
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,530
<font color="yellow">There will be many viewers.</font>

461
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,870
<font color="yellow">Wash up.</font>

462
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
<font color="yellow">Peel off.</font>

463

<font color="yellow">Masks.</font>

464
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,430
<font color="yellow">What would be best...</font>

465
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,270
<font color="yellow">for my skin?</font>

466
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,700
<font color="yellow">Dr Soh is the winner.</font>

467
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,960
<font color="yellow">He has great timing.</font>

468
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,130
<font color="yellow">It's impeccable.</font>

469
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,260
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi.</font>

470
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,770
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Sit.</font>

471
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,800
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Dr Soh ate.</font>

472
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,530
<font color="yellow">I should've brought him.</font>

473
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,700
<font color="yellow">Come on, Dr Kwon.</font>

474
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,430
<font color="yellow">Don't get ahead of yourself.</font>

475
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,800
<font color="yellow">Who said Dr Soh will be Kim Myung Soo's primary care doctor?</font>

476
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,230
<font color="yellow">You can kiss up to him after he becomes President.</font>

477
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,600
<font color="yellow">I brought my own food.</font>

478
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,130
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

479
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,760
<font color="yellow">I was shocked at Dr Lee.</font>

480
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,970
<font color="yellow">He totally laid it on his own son.</font>

481
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,170
<font color="yellow">What happens now to Dr Lee Young Oh?</font>

482
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,010
<font color="yellow">If the ethics council determine there is a problem,</font>

483
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,650
<font color="yellow">he may be dismissed...</font>

484
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,070
<font color="yellow">or he may lose his license.</font>

485
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,970
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

486
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,670
<font color="yellow">I'm going back now. Enjoy.</font>

487
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,790
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun must know.</font>

488
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,170
<font color="yellow">You operated with him.</font>

489
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
<font color="yellow">I guess we'll all find out when the ethics council tells us.</font>

490
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,520
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

491
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,700
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

492
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
<font color="yellow">Sure, I couldn't talk either.</font>

493
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,670
<font color="yellow">Word spreads so quickly.</font>

494
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,900
<font color="yellow">He may gain Dr Lee's disfavour, too.</font>

495
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

496
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,300
<font color="yellow">he may end up getting implicated, too.</font>

497
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

498
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,870
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

499
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,300
<font color="yellow">Here. Cheers.</font>

500
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,470
<font color="yellow">Don't drink too much.</font>

501
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,070
<font color="yellow">Your wife will call me again.</font>

502
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

503
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,500
<font color="yellow">When my wife calls,</font>

504
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,700
<font color="yellow">consider it a voice phishing call and hang up.</font>

505
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
<font color="yellow">Suk Joo,</font>

506
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,370
<font color="yellow">do you know...</font>

507
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,770
<font color="yellow">what my dream is?</font>

508
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,530
<font color="yellow">I know the answer to this.</font>

509
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,300
<font color="yellow">You want the amount of doctors who apply to Cardiothoracic...</font>

510
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,370
<font color="yellow">to double, right?</font>

511
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,690
<font color="yellow">I've wasted my life.</font>

512
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,700
<font color="yellow">Do you want 10 times the applicants?</font>

513
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,600
<font color="yellow">It's the opposite.</font>

514
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,900
<font color="yellow">It's for every single surgeon to disappear.</font>

515
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,170
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make a lot of money...</font>

516
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,900
<font color="yellow">under the name of Hyunsung and Cardio-cerebrovascular Centre.</font>

517
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
<font color="yellow">That way, my wallet...</font>

518
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,830
<font color="yellow">would always be nice and fat.</font>

519
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,130
<font color="yellow">That way,</font>

520
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,130
<font color="yellow">there will come a day when people can be cured...</font>

521
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,900
<font color="yellow">without surgery.</font>

522
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

523
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,230
<font color="yellow">Wasn't Jin Sung awesome today?</font>

524
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,400
<font color="yellow">She really looked like a police officer and a woman.</font>

525
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,300
<font color="yellow">Our little kid is all grown up.</font>

526
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,400
<font color="yellow">Sergeant Park.</font>

527
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,570
<font color="yellow">I'll return to work tomorrow.</font>

528
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,870
<font color="yellow">Hyunsung Medical Centre...</font>

529
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,200
<font color="yellow">will investigate Kang Chul Min's case.</font>

530
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,970
<font color="yellow">They'll find evidence that he was murdered.</font>

531
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,870
<font color="yellow">It's still a hospital.</font>

532
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,300
<font color="yellow">We have to have faith.</font>

533
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,500
<font color="yellow">I am the surgeon...</font>

534
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,470
<font color="yellow">who will perform the live surgery.</font>

535
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,500
<font color="yellow">What happened to the body?</font>

536
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,970
<font color="yellow">Even among cerebral aneurysms,</font>

537
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,970
<font color="yellow">it is a unprecedented, rare case.</font>

538
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,000
<font color="yellow">Tell me...</font>

539
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,720
<font color="yellow">what happened in the OR that day.</font>

540
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,500
<font color="yellow">I prepared this surgery. It is mine.</font>

541
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,570
<font color="yellow">You're wrong. Again.</font>

542
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,130
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

543
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,030
<font color="yellow">Look at me in the eyes.</font>

544
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,470
<font color="yellow">Don't think only about...</font>

545
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,570
<font color="yellow">what you want to say and what you think,</font>

546
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,000
<font color="yellow">but read the other person.</font>

547
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,720
<font color="yellow">His eyes are wide.</font>

548
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,000
<font color="yellow">His eyebrows are raised.</font>

549
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,350
<font color="yellow">His voice is confident.</font>

550
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,130
<font color="yellow">His lips are curled upwards.</font>

551
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,770
<font color="yellow">You are very angry...</font>

552
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,100
<font color="yellow">at my behaviour.</font>

553
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,300
<font color="yellow">This arm confirms his authority over me.</font>

554
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,970
<font color="yellow">It means both you and I know...</font>

555
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,400
<font color="yellow">that I am...</font>

556
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,600
<font color="yellow">still under your control.</font>

557
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,770
<font color="yellow">Don't forget the times...</font>

558
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,500
<font color="yellow">we've spent together.</font>

559
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,800
<font color="yellow">If it's for your sake,</font>

560
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,870
<font color="yellow">I can...</font>

561
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,370
<font color="yellow">start over, even now.</font>

562
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,400
<font color="yellow">Let me ask again.</font>

563
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,000
<font color="yellow">Why did you go to the morgue?</font>

564
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,770
<font color="yellow">I wanted to confirm something before the autopsy.</font>

565
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,030
<font color="yellow">What did you confirm?</font>

566
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,600
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

567
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,370
<font color="yellow">A patient who died naturally and one who died a table death...</font>

568
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,500
<font color="yellow">have no difference.</font>

569
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

570
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,200
<font color="yellow">That's what you should say to the ethics council.</font>

571
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,500
<font color="yellow">If you say that much,</font>

572
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,100
<font color="yellow">they'll believe you.</font>

573
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,670
<font color="yellow">Forget the ethics council.</font>

574
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,130
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

575
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,030
<font color="yellow">I trust you.</font>

576
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,090
<font color="yellow">- Should I not have asked...
- Change the time for your shot.</font>

577
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,130
<font color="yellow">We can add quetiapine as well.</font>

578
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,130
<font color="yellow">(Quetiapine: Medication for repressing impulses)</font>

579
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,200
<font color="yellow">Let's try it.</font>

580
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,770
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

581
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,770
<font color="yellow">handle it?</font>

582
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,000
<font color="yellow">He can live...</font>

583
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,470
<font color="yellow">like a normal person, right?</font>

584
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,600
<font color="yellow">He can't process emotions.</font>

585
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,130
<font color="yellow">It is impossible for him to read other people's emotions...</font>

586
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,200
<font color="yellow">or empathise. At all.</font>

587
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,070
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

588
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,100
<font color="yellow">It's called anti-social disorder.</font>

589
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,200
<font color="yellow">They can't socialise at all.</font>

590
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,740
<font color="yellow">He may be...</font>

591
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,000
<font color="yellow">much more dangerous that you can imagine.</font>

592
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

593
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,600
<font color="yellow">must I do?</font>

594
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,900
<font color="yellow">When people are happy,</font>

595
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,030
<font color="yellow">this is how they look.</font>

596
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,670
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

597
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
<font color="yellow">it's like...</font>

598
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,700
<font color="yellow">a signal.</font>

599
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,670
<font color="yellow">They touch their necks.</font>

600
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go over it again.</font>

601
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,240
<font color="yellow">When people are nervous...</font>

602
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,300
<font color="yellow">Forget the ethics council.</font>

603
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,830
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

604
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,500
<font color="yellow">His pupils were shaking.</font>

605
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,300
<font color="yellow">His eyebrows drooped down.</font>

606
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,700
<font color="yellow">Suspicion.</font>

607
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,200
<font color="yellow">He forced himself to make eye contact.</font>

608
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,900
<font color="yellow">I trust you.</font>

609
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,130
<font color="yellow">The subtle smile.</font>

610
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,300
<font color="yellow">Lies.</font>

611
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,500
<font color="yellow">Fear, that he does not...</font>

612
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,670
<font color="yellow">want to show.</font>

613
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,560
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

614
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,570
<font color="yellow">Is there a reason why you're disclosing your surgery?</font>

615
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,740
<font color="yellow">Cerebral aneurysms...</font>

616
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,300
<font color="yellow">are a representative ailment faced by society.</font>

617
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,100
<font color="yellow">Based on my long experience...</font>

618
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,400
<font color="yellow">I will experience our nation's medical abilities...</font>

619
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,000
<font color="yellow">and will be healed.</font>

620
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,300
<font color="yellow">Please have faith in me and in our medical industry,</font>

621
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,300
<font color="yellow">and support us.</font>

622
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,470
<font color="yellow">I, Kim Myung Soo,</font>

623
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,200
<font color="yellow">will be healed completely.</font>

624
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,240
<font color="yellow">My dear citizens who are fighting illnesses even as of today,</font>

625
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,400

<font color="yellow">He'll become brain dead.</font>

788
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,600
<font color="yellow">Are you going to kill him?</font>

789
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,270
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

790

<font color="yellow">up to you.</font>

791
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000

<font color="yellow">"The procedures to follow".</font>

793
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,000
<font color="yellow">They must be more important to you...</font>

00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,430
<font color="yellow">than Mr Kim.</font>

795
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

796
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
<font color="yellow">Start the operation now.</font>

797
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,630
<font color="yellow">You're the operating surgeon.</font>

798
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:46,100
<font color="yellow">I need another surgeon.</font>

799
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,800
<font color="yellow">You want me to do the operation?</font>

800
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,900
<font color="yellow">I thought it was an aneurysm operation.</font>

801
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,780
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

802
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,630
<font color="yellow">I'm aware that you're a cardiac surgeon...</font>

<font color="yellow">What do you want to show me?</font>

807
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,830
<font color="yellow">This operation will be a perfect...</font>

808
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,800

00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,000
<font color="yellow">I need to see the external carotid artery more clearly.</font>

812
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,800
<font color="yellow">You can't do that.</font>

813
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,480
<font color="yellow">Even a slight impact could put this patient in danger.</font>

814
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,300

<font color="yellow">If we move him,</font>

816
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,770
<font color="yellow">the thinned blood vessel will burst.</font>

817
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,000
<font color="yellow">We'll remove that blood vessel.</font>

818
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,530
<font color="yellow">You're removing the parent artery?</font>

819
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,760
<font color="yellow">The patient will die.</font>

820
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,330
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim, didn't you hear what I said?</font>

821
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
<font color="yellow">Adjust the table.</font>

822
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,630
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

823
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,230
<font color="yellow">- Suction!
- Yes, Doctor.</font>

00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,840
<font color="yellow">Dr Oh.</font>

825
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,300
<font color="yellow">This isn't medical school.</font>

826
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,230
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me...</font>

827
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,700
<font color="yellow">to be patient enough to explain every step of surgery...</font>

828
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,330
<font color="yellow">while I'm performing...</font>

829
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,200
<font color="yellow">an emergency operation?</font>

830
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,800
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun.</font>

831
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,500
<font color="yellow">Please extract the radial artery.</font>

832
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
<font color="yellow">(Radial artery: Supplies blood to the lateral side of the forearm)</font>

833
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,400
<font color="yellow">But the radial artery is in the wrist. What does that have to do...</font>

834
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,230
<font color="yellow">You're planning to perform a brain vessel bypass.</font>

835
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,300
<font color="yellow">Let's begin.</font>

836
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,600
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee, that's...</font>

837
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,600
<font color="yellow">It's a giant cerebral aneurysm due to the cirrhosis...</font>

838
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,700
<font color="yellow">caused by fungus.</font>

839
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,880
<font color="yellow">It's hard to locate the spot for clipping.</font>

840
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,500
<font color="yellow">It's difficult to find the lesion...</font>

841
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,270
<font color="yellow">using CT, MRI or an angiography.</font>

842
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,980
<font color="yellow">You can't find that out...</font>

843
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,800
<font color="yellow">unless you open the brain and do a biopsy.</font>

844
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,870
<font color="yellow">This is a rare case.</font>

845
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,000
<font color="yellow">How did you know about this?</font>

846
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,530
<font color="yellow">You didn't open his brain to do a biopsy.</font>

847
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,500
<font color="yellow">I've seen a similar patient.</font>

848
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,300
<font color="yellow">It was the patient who died...</font>

849
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,530
<font color="yellow">during our collaborative surgery.</font>

850
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,070
<font color="yellow">I found this tiny fungus...</font>

851
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,300
<font color="yellow">that I hadn't seen before in the patient's brain.</font>

852
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,400
<font color="yellow">As I hadn't seen it before,</font>

853
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,900
<font color="yellow">I wanted to look into it.</font>

854
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,070
<font color="yellow">That's why I watched the surgery footage.</font>

855
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,770
<font color="yellow">Normally, it flows into the blood vessel from the heart.</font>

856
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,600
<font color="yellow">It seems to be a type of infectious fungus.</font>

857
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,780
<font color="yellow">Infectious fungus...</font>

858
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,270
<font color="yellow">It's common among endocarditis patients, drug users...</font>

859
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,500
<font color="yellow">and immunosuppressant users.</font>

860
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,270
<font color="yellow">Dr Lee.</font>

861
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,130
<font color="yellow">Please keep this a secret.</font>

862
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,330
<font color="yellow">I want to use it for my research.</font>

863
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,580
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim was being treated...</font>

864
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,430
<font color="yellow">for endocarditis.</font>

865
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,800
<font color="yellow">I wanted to examine the body of the patient who died...</font>

866
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,600
<font color="yellow">during the surgery to see if the fungus in his brain...</font>

867
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,700
<font color="yellow">was caused by endocarditis.</font>

868
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,070
<font color="yellow">As I had expected, his body showed signs of infectious endocarditis.</font>

869
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,900
<font color="yellow">They were not car accident wounds.</font>

870
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,890
<font color="yellow">Considering these symptoms,</font>

871
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,210
<font color="yellow">I was certain that it might be a mycotic giant aneurysm.</font>

872
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,530
<font color="yellow">I was sure.</font>

873
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,400
<font color="yellow">And it needed an open brain operation.</font>

874
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,770
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say that at the conference?</font>

875
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

876
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,270
<font color="yellow">that those who were at the conference...</font>

877
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,700
<font color="yellow">know better.</font>

878
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,800
<font color="yellow">Why here?</font>

879
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,230
<font color="yellow">Why did you choose the hospital I'm working in?</font>

880
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,030
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

881
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,800
<font color="yellow">When I told you not to become a doctor,</font>

882
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,800
<font color="yellow">you promised...</font>

883
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,600
<font color="yellow">that you would become a good doctor like normal people.</font>

884
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:20,970
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

885
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,700
<font color="yellow">you made a deal over a patient's life.</font>

886
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,700
<font color="yellow">To make it worse, it was as soon as you came back.</font>

887
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,600
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

888
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,200
<font color="yellow">I came to realise...</font>

889
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,130
<font color="yellow">that the best asset I have as a doctor...</font>

890
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,000
<font color="yellow">is this completely hollow heart of mine.</font>

891
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,170
<font color="yellow">That's how...</font>

892
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,130
<font color="yellow">I was able to save Mr Kim.</font>

893
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,800
<font color="yellow">I wasn't distracted by emotions.</font>

894
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,230
<font color="yellow">I had no fear.</font>

895
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,030
<font color="yellow">Did I tell you...</font>

896
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:06,000
<font color="yellow">that I'd become a good doctor like normal people?</font>

897
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Father.</font>

898
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,070
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

899
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,030
<font color="yellow">I can keep that promise.</font>

900
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,770
<font color="yellow">I'm already...</font>

901
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
<font color="yellow">superior than anyone else...</font>

902
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,800
<font color="yellow">as a doctor.</font>

903
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,030
<font color="yellow">I have a question for Dr Soh Ji Yong.</font>

904
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:05,300
<font color="yellow">I heard that there was a problem during surgery.</font>

905
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,490
<font color="yellow">What's the cause?</font>

906
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:10,150
<font color="yellow">That's enough. Please read the news release for further information.</font>

907
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,400
<font color="yellow">We prepared a meal...</font>

908
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,500
<font color="yellow">Is it true that Mr Kim's life could have been in danger...</font>

909
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,900
<font color="yellow">without Dr Lee Young Oh's open brain surgery?</font>

910
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,200
<font color="yellow">Was it a misjudgement of the operation method?</font>

911
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,000
<font color="yellow">Was it medical malpractice?</font>

912
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,400
<font color="yellow">That's what this hospital is all about.</font>

913
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,000
<font color="yellow">Keep your chin up, Dr Soh.</font>

914
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,330
<font color="yellow">We won't apologise to them...</font>

915
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,700
<font color="yellow">because of your incompetency.</font>

916
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,900
<font color="yellow">It's true that Mr Kim's life was in danger.</font>

917
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:46,800
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

918
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,200
<font color="yellow">it wasn't medical malpractice.</font>

919
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,430
<font color="yellow">It was an emergency situation that could happen to any one of us.</font>

920
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,870
<font color="yellow">The time when we hope for...</font>

921
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,800
<font color="yellow">a miracle made by one genius doctor is over now.</font>

922
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,600
<font color="yellow">What happened today...</font>

923
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,700
<font color="yellow">proved that our hospital has a great medical team...</font>

924
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,300
<font color="yellow">and how well we can respond to emergency situations...</font>

925
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,500
<font color="yellow">because of our medical staff.</font>

926
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,230
<font color="yellow">Dr Soh Ji Yong...</font>

927
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,200
<font color="yellow">helped prove this.</font>

928
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,230
<font color="yellow">Aren't I right, Dr Soh?</font>

929
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,700
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's right!</font>

930
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,500
<font color="yellow">This is how our hospital is!</font>

931
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:43,870
<font color="yellow">I have another question.</font>

932
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,700
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything unusual...</font>

933
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,900
<font color="yellow">other than the signs of endocarditis...</font>

934
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,700
<font color="yellow">when you examined Patient Kang Chul Min?</font>

935
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,000
<font color="yellow">- For instance...
- For instance,</font>

936
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,600
<font color="yellow">that his heart was missing?</font>

937
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,000
<font color="yellow">You're such a bad liar.</font>

938
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,400
<font color="yellow">You knew...</font>

939
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,630
<font color="yellow">that his heart was missing.</font>

940
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:13,900
<font color="yellow">As I expected,</font>

941
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,130
<font color="yellow">I wasn't the only one that visited the morgue.</font>

942
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,070
<font color="yellow">Because you, Dr Hyun Suk Joo,</font>

943
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,230
<font color="yellow">were there as well.</font>

944
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,700
<font color="yellow">Isn't that true?</font>

945
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,550
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're here.</font>

946
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,480
<font color="yellow">You'll find this interesting, too.</font>

947
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,500
<font color="yellow">Look forward to it.</font>

948
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,500
<font color="yellow">I know what you want to know...</font>

949
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,100
<font color="yellow">is this.</font>

950
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,400
<font color="yellow">You're wondering if I was the one who took the heart.</font>

951
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in...</font>

952
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:05,300
<font color="yellow">the 300g lump of muscles that can only pump blood.</font>

953
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,700
<font color="yellow">However, I know who did it.</font>

954
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,600
<font color="yellow">It's either someone who you know well...</font>

955
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,600
<font color="yellow">or someone Officer Gye trusts.</font>

956
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,600
<font color="yellow">Dr Hyun,</font>

957
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,770
<font color="yellow">you might be the one who did it.</font>

958
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,830
<font color="yellow">(Beautiful Mind)</font>

959
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,990
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me.</font>

960
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:53,660
<font color="yellow">You made me trust you. How can you do this to me?</font>

961
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,890
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you were cruel?</font>

962
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,590
<font color="yellow">I hope he didn't cause any trouble.</font>

963
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:00,290
<font color="yellow">Just stay quiet...</font>

964
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,580
<font color="yellow">in fear that I might be the one who really did it.</font>

965
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,090
<font color="yellow">Can I see you now?</font>

966
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,070
<font color="yellow">Are you hiding something from me?</font>

967
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:09,470
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

968
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,120
<font color="yellow">I'm going to perform an emergency operation.</font>

969
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,370
<font color="yellow">The patient is Director Shin Dong Jae.</font>
